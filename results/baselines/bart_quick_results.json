The victims, devotees of Lord Shiva known as Kanwarias, had just disembarked from a passenger train and were walking along the tracks toward a nearby temple when the Saharsa-Patna Rajyarani Express, traveling at 80 km/h, ran over them. The express train was not scheduled to stop at the station. In the aftermath, enraged locals attacked train staff, set fire to coaches, and vandalized the station. The train drivers fled after being assaulted. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar appealed for calm and directed full deployment of rescue resources. An internal inquiry was ordered by the Railway Board to investigate the incident. The tragedy underscored serious safety lapses and the vulnerability of pilgrims during religious travel.\n\n",

    "reference": "Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla’s return from the International Space Station marks a major milestone in India’s space journey, shifting from symbolic participation to strategic capability-building. Unlike previous missions, this effort was driven by India’s own investment and included seven Indian-designed experiments, providing vital experience for ISRO’s upcoming Gaganyaan human spaceflight mission in 2027. Shukla’s presence aboard the ISS showcased India’s growing confidence and ambition in space exploration. The ₹500 crore mission was not ceremonial—it offered real-world exposure to orbital operations and international collaboration. This success highlights India’s transition from a participant to a stakeholder in global space exploration, reinforcing its plans for a space station by 2035 and a Moon mission by 2040. As Shukla put it, this is just the beginning.",
