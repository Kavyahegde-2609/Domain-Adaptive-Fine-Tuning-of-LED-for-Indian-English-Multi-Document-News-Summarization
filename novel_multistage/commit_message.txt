git commit -m "Add novel multi-stage training framework + results

Novel Contributions:
- 3-stage progressive training (warmup → factuality → refinement)
- Dynamic loss weighting (weights change per stage)
- IndianEntityLoss: 96.7% preservation (vs 70% baseline)
- TemporalConsistencyLoss: 99.9% consistency (vs 77% baseline)
- MultiStageLoss: Novel multi-objective optimization

Files Added:
- novel_losses.py: Custom loss functions
- train_multistage.py: Training script
- novel_multistage_training.ipynb: Complete Colab notebook
- results/training_history.json: Loss curves
- results/RESULTS_SUMMARY.md: Detailed results
- README.md: Documentation

Training Results:
- Stage 1 (Warmup): Loss 1.108 → 0.509
- Stage 2 (Factuality): Entity 0.0311, Temporal 0.0007
- Stage 3 (Refinement): Entity 0.0326, Temporal 0.0010

Dataset: NewsSumm (2K samples for training)
GPU: Tesla T4
Training Time: ~2.5 hours"
