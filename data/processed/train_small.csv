The Times of India,1/1/0003,"Mumbai Metropolitan Region Authority-like body planned for buying medicines, equipment","NAGPUR: The state is planning to set up the Maharashtra Medical Authority, on the lines of MMRDA, to buy drugs and medical and surgical equipment for its medical colleges and hospitals.

With extensive delays in the purchase of medicines, and surgical equipment for state-run medical colleges and hospitals through Haffkine Bio-Pharmaceutical Corporation, the state government has said it may soon set up Maharashtra Medical Authority on the lines of MMRDA for buying these. Medical education minister Girish Mahajan said this on Friday in the state legislative council, while replying to a calling attention motion by MLCs Praveen Datke, Chandrashekhar Bawankule and Nago Ganar.

MMRDA-like body planned for buying meds, equipment

Mahajan also said since there is a big delay in providing medicines to patients, the state has increased the purchasing capacity of hospitals at the local level from 10% to 30% as a stop-gap arrangement. Mahajan said delays are caused since orders are not placed in time due to staggered administrative approval and lack of manpower in Haffkine.""Following complaints received on this behalf, attempts are being made to fast-track the tendering process at Haffkine... At the same time, the government is thinking about setting up a Maharashtra Medical Authority on the lines of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Authority (MMDRA) too,"" Mahajan said in his written reply.

The state's public health department had earlier this year proposed to the government to review the idea of purchases through a single entity-Haffkine Biopharmaceutical Ltd. The reason for the proposal was the failure of Haffkine's procurement cell to make timely purchases for various systemic problems, leading to a delay of 1.5 to 4 years in delivery of drugs and equipment. A senior official said they had suggested creation of an independent corporation on the lines of Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation, which looks after the ready purchase of medical equipment and drugs.","The Maharashtra government is considering establishing the Maharashtra Medical Authority, akin to MMRDA, to streamline the procurement of drugs and medical equipment for state medical institutions. The move comes in response to significant delays in purchasing through Haffkine Bio-Pharmaceutical Corporation, causing delays of 1.5 to 4 years in delivering essential supplies. Medical Education Minister Girish Mahajan highlighted this issue in the state legislative council, mentioning plans to boost local hospitals' purchasing capacity temporarily while exploring a more permanent solution through the proposed Maharashtra Medical Authority, modeled after MMRDA and Tamil Nadu's procurement system.",Politics,93,308
The Tribune,1/1/0209,No scope of Prez rule in WB: PC,"Faced with a stiff opposition on its decision to send a Central team to West Bengal’s Lalgarh area, the government today assured both Houses of Parliament that there was no scope for the imposition of President’s Rule following the Bommai judgment.

As opposition parties, led by the CPM, termed the government’s move as “unconstitutional and undemocratic,” Home Minister P Chidambaram stepped in to say, “Post-Bommai, there is no scope ...for the imposition of the Central rule. The move to send the Central team is entirely non-confrontational. There is no need to view it through the prism of Article 356.” Chidambaram gave the same assurance to the Rajya Sabha.

The minister’s reference was to the 1994 Supreme Court ruling where it said no state government could be dismissed without being afforded a chance to prove the majority on the floor of the House.

Assurance apart, both Houses saw an aggressive Left corner the government on the issue, with the LS seeing three adjournments and RS two. Left and SP members were the most vocal, and stormed the well in Lok Sabha in question hour. CPM’s Basudeb Acharia sought the suspension of the question hour, but was denied a chance by Speaker Meira Kumar.

He made the noise nevertheless, with the Trinamool countering him with a demand for imposition of the President’s Rule in Bengal. The BJP for its part subtly sided with the Left, despite the latter’s earlier support to the dismissal of three BJP governments in the wake of the Babri Masjid demolition.

Though Leader of the Opposition LK Advani accused the Left today of double standards on the Central rule, he warned the Centre against taking the Article 356 lightly; in Rajya Sabha, BJP’s Arun Jaitley voiced the same sentiment and supported CPM leader Sitaram Yechury’s contention that the deputation of the Central team was unconstitutional. “We would like to be assured that this wasn’t done at the behest of the Congress’ alliance partner,” Jaitley said.

A cornered Chidambaram naturally was on back foot and said the team was only meant to assist law and order issues. “I have a good working relationship with West Bengal; CM Buddhadeb Bhattacharya,” the Home Minister added, referring to growing inter-party clashes on the issue as the reason behind the move.

Back in the LS, the uproar was led by Acharia who denounced the government move saying every state had some problem. “Law and order is a state subject,” he reminded the Centre, accusing it of succumbing to Mamata Banerjee’s pressure.

SP’s Mulayam Singh Yadav also attacked the government warning of such moves becoming precedents. “That means you can impose the President’s Rule in any state,” he asked, while Advani said the Article 356 should only be used in the “rarest of cases and certainly not in ones stemming from law and order”.

“The constitution-makers had conceded the possibility of misusing of the Article and wanted it to be turned into a dead letter. The Sarkaria Commission had also gone into these aspects,” said Advani with CPI’s Gurudas Dasgupta also objected to the Central team being sent.","The Indian government assured both houses of Parliament that there was no scope for the imposition of President's Rule in West Bengal following the opposition's protest against the government's decision to send a Central team to the state's Lalgarh area. Home Minister P. Chidambaram stated that the move to send the Central team was non-confrontational, and there was no need to view it through the prism of Article 356, referring to the 1994 Supreme Court ruling that no state government could be dismissed without being afforded a chance to prove the majority on the floor of the House. The opposition, particularly the Left and Samajwadi Party, accused the government of acting unconstitutionally and undemocratically.

The Economic Times,1/1/0210,Companies adopt wierd names to catch consumer attention  ,"NEW DELHI/BANGALORE: In New Delhi’s posh South Extension area, there’s a shop called Mom & Me by the Ring Road.
Nobody needs to be told what they sell there: all kinds of mother and child products from toys and strollers to advice and
apparels. Plain and simple brand name. But not everybody thinks Mahindra Group’s retail venture has the best brand
name because it does not appeal to one’s curiosity.
Well, the new hype among marketers perpetually engaged in a fight to win the customer’s attention is having a whacky, if
So we have Happily Unmarried gift seller, Phat Phish music recorder, and apparel brands Fried Water, Tantra, Aliva,
People Tree and Penny Lane, catching eyeballs first before revealing their product line.
""This is the most ridiculous phase in our revolution... many entrepreneurs nowadays ask us to come up with creative
titles as they want to be different,"" says Harish Bijoor, brand consultant and CEO of Harish Bijoor Consults Inc. The idea
is to make a strong first impression.
""It is a time of instant fame which is followed by hard work to retain the fame,"" says Satbir Singh, chief creative officer of
ad agency Euro RSCG. He says that social networking sites such as Facebook, Orkut and Twitter have ensured faster
word-of-mouth communication and higher brand recall by consumers.
Though it doesn’t ensure success, this strategy seems to have worked in cases such as Fried Water. ""They exemplify a new
concept, which is to shock to get attention, and use that as the starting point to get customers,"" says Prof K Kumar of IIMBangalore, who has studied this in one of his cases.
Bangalore-based Wyn Brands is not a career coaching firm or a winemaker. It is an agriculture produce firm, which
specialises in bringing fresh farm produce directly to the customer in various shops and malls.
A cut-vegetable supply firm founded in 2003, Wyn bills itself as first of its kind in India—buying, storing, cleaning,
cutting, packaging and delivering fresh vegetables to restaurants. So why not a name that has ‘farm’ or ‘fresh’ or ‘green’?
""The recall value is good with this name, and it signifies progress, an upward movement,"" says Stephen Poonnen, founder
and MD of Wyn Brands.
So how do they come up with these names? Anand Surapur, owner of Phat Phish Films and Phat Phish Records, thought
of the name while he was waiting for a fish fry on the Goa beach. He used to like a music band called Phish. And since
fish was cooked quick, it became Phat Phish. The album ‘Rabbi’ was released under Phat Phish label in 2004 and was an
instant hit.
The trend is catching up fast. In the next six months or so, there will be new milk brand named ‘Dudu’ and an acidity
relief medicine called ‘Buru buru buru buru’ in the market. ""We know these brand names will immediately catch
attention as consumers can relate,"" says Bijoor.
But their success depends on their honesty, he adds. ""If the brand is honest and works well with the target audience, then
the name, in the long run, will be associated with trust, conviction and sincerity that it offers."" Interestingly, it’s start-ups
and new entrepreneurs who bet mostly on different names, while older players prefer more conventional names, which
mostly include the established business names, for their new ventures.
""Brands with such weird names will not target major masses but will target a particular niche segment,"" says Prof Piyush
Sinha, who teaches retailing at Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad. ""Established names will be wary of
experimenting with such new names with a fear of rejection as consumers identify and accept them with their previous
titles.Going for whacky titles of brands has been prevalent in the western markets for long. Apparel brands such as Mango,
Diesel, Gap and FCUK are all international brands. So are Apple gadgets and Orange phone service.
But names can also get you into trouble. Steve Jobs, when he formed Apple, is reputed to have chosen the name because
he was a Beatles fan and loved the Apple recording label.
He was not to know that 30 years later he would see the recording company in court about the name. But then, anything
to stay in sync with the consumers.","In the competitive world of marketing, unconventional brand names like Happily Unmarried, Phat Phish, and Fried Water are gaining attention for their quirky appeal. This trend aims to make a strong first impression and capitalize on fast-paced communication through social media. While such names may not target mass markets, they resonate with niche segments and can lead to successful branding if backed by honesty and consumer trust. Established players often stick to conventional names, while startups and entrepreneurs embrace creativity. However, the strategy isn't without risks, as seen in the potential legal challenges faced by brands like Apple. Overall, the trend reflects a global phenomenon where brands strive for distinctiveness and consumer engagement through unconventional nomenclature.",Business and Finance,116,714

The Hindu,1/1/1010,Bankers do not see any interest rate spike,"In a notable development, leading bankers, including State Bank of India Chairman O. P. Bhatt and Corporation Bank Chief J. M. Garg, are expressing their outlook on interest rates, forecasting a period of stability for at least the next six months. These sentiments have been conveyed ahead of the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) upcoming policy review scheduled for later this month.

Expectation of Interest Rate Stability:

The bankers have collectively conveyed their expectation that interest rates will remain unchanged in the near term, at least until June-end. This anticipation reflects their assessment of the current economic landscape and the need for a predictable and steady monetary policy.

Call for Unchanged Monetary Stance:

In alignment with their forecast, the banking leaders are urging the RBI to maintain its existing key policy ratios and rates. This call for an unchanged monetary stance underscores the importance of stability and continuity in financial markets, providing businesses and consumers with a sense of predictability.

Rationale Behind the Stance:

While the specific reasons behind the bankers' recommendations are not explicitly outlined, such calls for stability often stem from a delicate balance between stimulating economic growth and managing inflation. The ongoing global economic uncertainties and the need for a cautious approach to monetary policy may also influence their stance.

Economic Context:

The bankers' views are situated within the broader economic context, where the central bank plays a pivotal role in shaping monetary policies. Interest rates, including the repo rate and reverse repo rate, have far-reaching implications for borrowing costs, investments, and overall economic activities.","Leading bankers, including State Bank of India Chairman O.

to 21.98-million units last year and may
exceed 24 million in 2014, the statebacked China Association of
Automobile Manufacturers said on
Thursday in Beijing. Last year’s sales of
passenger vehicles, excluding buses and
commercial trucks, climbed to 17.93-
million — or 15% more than the US
auto industry — and may increase 9%
to 11% this year, it said.
While China’s motorization has been a boon for foreign automakers -- all the
major ones saw record sales in the country in 2013 --pressure is building on
the government to step in as pollution chokes residents and traffic congestion
turns roads into parking lots. With air quality deteriorating so much that
children and the elderly are regularly warned to stay indoors, Beijing is
tightening its vehicle quotas and Tianjin is capping the number of licenses
issued this year. ""As more and more big cities put in place restriction
measures, automakers will have to count on smaller cities and inland areas for
growth,"" said Harry Chen, a Shenzhen-based analyst with Guotai Junan
Securities Co. ""Local automakers will really need to bring on their A-game to
compete with foreign joint ventures to survive.""

Passenger vehicle sales alone reached 17.93 million, surpassing the US auto industry by 15%. Despite these impressive figures, concerns over pollution and traffic congestion have prompted Chinese cities like Beijing and Tianjin to impose stricter vehicle quotas and licensing restrictions.

The Hindu,1/11/0012,Zebra Finches can smell,"It was long thought that songbirds did not use their sense of smell. That was because a 1968 study had found that the olfactory bulbs in their brains are smaller than those of other kinds of birds.

But a new study reports that zebra finch fledglings can recognize their relatives by smell.

Although the olfactory region in the finches “is small, it seems to work,” said E. Tobias Krause, a biologist at Bielefeld University in Germany and one of the study's authors.

Krause and his colleagues report their findings in the journal Biology Letters .

After the zebra finches hatched, the researchers placed the chicks in different broods, away from their parents.

At the age of 20 to 23 days, each bird was presented with odour samples from the nest it hatched in and the nest that served as its foster home.

The birds indicated their preference by entering or perching in front of the artificial nest box that produced the more appealing odor.

“They choose the nest of their genetic parent,” Krause said.

Detecting relatives
The birds may be using smell to detect relatives and avoid inbreeding, Krause said.

“Our results are restricted to zebra finches, but it is very likely that other songbirds and other birds have this capacity for kin recognition,” he said. .”","Previously, it was believed that songbirds lacked a sense of smell due to smaller olfactory bulbs. However, a recent study reveals that zebra finch fledglings can recognize relatives by scent. E. Tobias Krause and colleagues from Bielefeld University found that despite the small olfactory region, finches could discern odors. In the experiment, chicks were placed in different broods and later presented with odor samples from their genetic nest and foster nest. They consistently preferred the scent of their genetic nest, suggesting kin recognition. Krause speculates that this ability helps birds avoid inbreeding. While the study focuses on zebra finches, it implies that other songbirds likely possess similar capabilities. The findings are published in Biology Letters, indicating a reevaluation of songbirds' olfactory abilities and social behaviors.",Science and Technology,125,217
The Hindu,1/11/0018,Swachh initiative changes quality of life,"The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, launched in 2014, has proven to be a game-changer for numerous remote communities across India. A shining example of this success can be seen in the 38 Adivasi Raj Gond families residing in the Mohanguda hamlet of Indervelli mandal in Adilabad district, Telangana. Previously plagued by poor sanitation, open defecation, and frequent health issues, this tribal hamlet has witnessed a remarkable transformation due to its wholehearted adoption of the Swachh Bharat sanitation model.

Before the intervention, the residents of Mohanguda lived without access to toilets, clean drinking water, or proper waste disposal systems. Open defecation was widespread, resulting in serious health hazards like diarrhoea, skin infections, and vector-borne diseases, especially among children and elderly people. The village's isolation and limited resources compounded these problems, and the health and hygiene situation remained bleak for decades.

The Swachh Bharat Mission, in coordination with local administration and voluntary organizations, brought a turning point. Awareness campaigns were conducted in Gondi, the native language of the community, explaining the importance of hygiene, personal sanitation, and safe waste disposal. With government aid and technical support, every household was equipped with a functional toilet. Drainage systems were laid, and soak pits were installed to manage wastewater. Women, who had earlier faced immense difficulties and loss of dignity due to the lack of private sanitation, became active participants and supporters of this change.

Apart from better health indicators, the change in sanitation habits has also brought social benefits. School attendance among children has improved, as many girls earlier dropped out due to the lack of separate toilet facilities. Instances of waterborne illnesses have significantly reduced, saving families medical expenses and allowing them to channel resources into livelihood and education. The hamlet is now a model for other tribal villages, drawing visitors from nearby mandals and officials from district headquarters who wish to replicate its success.

Today, Mohanguda is not only open defecation free (ODF) but also moving towards becoming a clean and green village. The success story is a testament to how targeted government schemes, when implemented with community involvement, can uplift even the most marginalised groups. The Raj Gond families now live with dignity, improved health, and a newfound sense of empowerment — all thanks to the Swachh Bharat initiative.","

 Russia calls for UNSC meeting after U.S. and Britain strike Yemen

""We strongly condemn the military attacks carried out this morning by the United States and the United Kingdom on several cities in Yemen"", said Nasser Kanaani, spokesperson at Iran's foreign ministry.

""These attacks are a clear violation of Yemen's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and a breach of international laws,"" he added.

Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian praised the Iran-aligned Houthis' actions against Israel-linked vessels and said the movement upholds maritime security. He urged the United States to end its all-out support for Israel.

""Yemen's action in...confronting the genocide of the Israeli regime is admirable. Sanaa strictly adheres to maritime security,"" Amirabdollahian said on the X platform.

""Instead of attacking Yemen, the White House should immediately stop all-out military and security cooperation with Tel Aviv — against the people of Gaza and the West Bank — to restore security across the region,"" he added.

The Economic Times,1/14/0018,How Tata Trusts reinvents itself by helping state governments and MPs with data-driven tools,"Data can be eye-openers. Sudhir Mungantiwar, Maharashtra’s minister for finance, planning and forestry, was taken aback when he saw the low penetration of cooking gas connections in his home district of Chandrapur.

Even though the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, which provides LPG connections to families below the poverty line, had some beneficiaries in Chandrapur, the majority of poor homes did not get it. In fact, only 18% households had got the connection.

The data on gas connections, which stumped Mungantiwar, was collected by a team of youngsters trained by Tata Trusts. Armed with tablets, they had fanned across the district, collecting information from households. Chandrapur is part of eastern Maharashtra, in the Nagpur division, with a population of 2.2 lakh, according to the 2011 Census.

Mungantiwar realised, as he explained to ET Magazine in an interview, many poor families had slipped through the cracks of the criteria under the Social and Economic Caste Census 2011. In early 2017, he set out to correct it; cooking gas connectivity in Chandrapur has now inched closer to the 50% mark. Next, Mungantiwar wants to apply the data captured by Tata Trusts on housing needs.

Mungantiwar roped in Tata Trusts after he read about its pilot project in Vijayawada, the constituency of TDP MP Kesineni Srinivas. Tata Trusts is running pilots on data-driven governance in four districts across the country, apart from providing research assistance on data-driven governance to 20 parliamentarians, including Tarun Gogoi of the Congress and Rajiv Pratap Rudy of the BJP. The Trusts is also involved in capturing municipal data in three cities across India — Pune, Jamshedpur and Surat (See element “From Villages to Cities”).

R Venkataramanan, managing trustee of Tata Trusts, identifies data-driven governance as a key area for it. He told ET Magazine: “Our goal is two-fold: helping administrations target their schemes with greater accuracy, and generating awareness among communities of the plethora of government support they can avail.”

Stakeholders in Governance In the process, Tata Trusts, a group of charitable trusts led by former Tata Group chairman Ratan Tata, has emerged as partners for politicians, ministers and administrators of all hues. Mungantiwar himself talks about how Tata Trusts spearheaded the process and made multiple visits to his district. He says: “Chandrapur missed out on the Tatas 100 years ago, when JN Tata considered the district for setting up his steel plant, but chose Jamshedpur instead. They have finally reached here.”

More than 700 km from Chandrapur, in the city of Pune, Municipal Commissioner Kunal Kumar recalls a meeting with Ratan Tata, where he sought Tata Trusts’ help for a project to make CNG out of municipal waste. In the course of the conversation, Kumar learnt that Tata Trusts was partners of the Canada-based World Council on City Data (WCCD) and could help Pune city become a member of WCCD and set up a data portal.

“Three months ago Ratan Tata got an officer from TCS posted with the Pune Municipal Corporation for a period of three years,” says Kumar. (PricewaterhouseCoopers is also a partner in this project.) Apart from working on capturing all the data, relevant municipal data that could be of use to a citizen is being uploaded to the internet. Kumar says that this is a proactive system where information is provided upfront unlike, say, RTI where one has to apply for it. A citizen-led complaint redress system has also been started.

Thanks to the data, organisations are building apps for utilities like public bus services. “Another application is a predictive system for vector-borne diseases. We have captured information of occurrence of vector-borne diseases, we want to use it to predict where it may break out and when,” Kumar explains.

Meanwhile, in Odisha, Kalikesh Narayan Singh Deo, a BJD MP from Bolangir, has partnered with Tata Trusts in more ways than one. Singh Deo says that after visiting the US a couple of years ago and interacting with the then secretary of state John Kerry, he was impressed with the amount of work done by interns attached with senior elected representatives, and wished there was something similar in India. He pushed for a system with the former Lok Sabha speaker Meira Kumar too.


Eventually, the Constitution Club of India (a Delhi club for MPs), the Swaniti Initiative and Tata Trusts jointly started a programme called SPARC (Supporting Parliamentarians on Analysis & Research in Constituency), giving young researchers internships with MPs. Singh Deo says that having an intern constantly working on data and solutions has been a godsend for his work as an MP.

Figuring it Out
Bolangir had problems managing its water bodies. So did Chevella in Telengana, a constituency neighbouring Hyderabad, represented by TRS MP KV Reddy. The issues were different, though. Bolangir was drought-prone, while Chevella’s ponds had water hyacinths. Tata Trusts set about addressing the problems.

A boat designed to remove water hyacinths was deployed to clean up the 60 ponds in Chevella. For Bolangir, JCB machines were used to dredge and deepen the ponds. Says Singh Deo: “Elected representatives in India get little assistance in terms of research and data about their constituencies. Tata Trusts has been a big help.” He adds that bigger, even “riskier projects” can be tried out under Tata pilots before a government body takes over and scales them up.

He hopes the internship programme also scales up so all elected representatives can get such support. There is already a huge demand from other MPs, he says. “Data-driven governance promoted by Tata Trusts is a great service unlike other CSR (corporate social responsibility) programmes that often focus on working around company factories,” says Singh Deo.

Tata Trusts — Sir Ratan Tata Trust and Sir Dorab Tata Trust — owns around 64% of Tata Sons, the Tata Group holding company, and therefore is more of a businessowner than a corporate CSR programme. As events of October 2016 showed, when Tata Trusts moved to replace then Tata Sons chairman Cyrus Mistry, first with Ratan Tata as an interim chairman and ultimately with N Chandrasekaran in February 2017, questions were raised in many quarters about its conduct. For a while, Tata Trusts was seen to be losing the perception battle.
Given the recent history, being a partner in governance surely helps. Apart from state governments, Tata Trusts has signed up with some high-profile partners like Google, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation as well as the WCCD. Says Venkataramanan: “We have worked with partners for decades. We team up with entities that supplement our efforts to reach marginalised communities.” Maharashtra minister Mungantiwar has kind words for Ratan Tata. He says: “It seems Tata is doing this work from his heart.

Apart from data-driven governance, they are also helping us in many other projects — from supporting training for bamboo-related industry to welfare of cancer patients.” 2017 was a rich year for Tata Trusts in terms of building partnerships with governments. It has signed a whole set of Memorandums of Understanding with state governments — from Assam to Rajasthan to Karnataka — on varied subjects like taking care of migrant workers and nutrition.

It is also changing the manner in which administrators think and is winning many to Tata’s way of figuring out issues with numbers. Pune’s Municipal Commissioner Kumar points out that while a demand-based approach to development leads funds to areas that are more vocal in asking for them, a datadriven approach is focused and far more effective.","Tata Trusts, a group of charitable trusts led by former Tata Group chairman Ratan Tata, is running pilots on data-driven governance in four districts across India, as well as providing research assistance to 20 politicians. The group is also capturing municipal data in Pune, Jamshedpur and Surat as part of an attempt to help the Indian government improve its schemes and generate awareness among communities. It is also investigating ways of helping administrations target schemes more accurately.",Business and Finance,77,1239
The Shillong Times,1/14/0024,Why is the universe ripping itself apart?,"What is the universe made of? This question has driven astronomers for hundreds of years.
For the past quarter of a century, scientists have believed “normal” stuff like atoms and molecules that make up you, Earth, and nearly everything we can see only accounts for 5% of the universe. Another 25% is “dark matter”, an unknown substance we can’t see but which we can detect through how it affects normal matter via gravity.
The remaining 70% of the cosmos is made of “dark energy”. Discovered in 1998, this is an unknown form of energy believed to be making the universe expand at an ever-increasing rate.
In a new study soon to be published in the Astronomical Journal, the properties of dark energy have measured in more detail than ever before. The results show it may be a hypothetical vacuum energy first proposed by Einstein – or it may be something stranger and more complicated that changes over time.
What is dark energy?
When Einstein developed the General Theory of Relativity over a century ago, he realised his equations showed the universe should either be expanding or shrinking. This seemed wrong to him, so he added a “cosmological constant” – a kind of energy inherent in empty space – to balance out the force of gravity and keep the universe static.
Later, when the work of Henrietta Swan Leavitt and Edwin Hubble showed the universe was indeed expanding, Einstein did away with the cosmological constant, calling it his “greatest mistake”.
However, in 1998, two teams of researchers found the expansion of the universe was actually accelerating. This implies that something quite similar to Einstein’s cosmological constant may exist after all – something we now call dark energy.
Since those initial measurements, we’ve been using supernovae and other probes to measure the nature of dark energy. Until now, these results have shown the density of dark energy in the universe appears to be constant.
This means the strength of dark energy remains the same, even as the universe grows – it doesn’t seem to be spread more thinly as the universe gets bigger. We measure this with a number called w. Einstein’s cosmological constant in effect set w to -1, and earlier observations have suggested this was about right.
Exploding stars as cosmic measuring sticks
How do we measure what is in the universe and how fast it is growing? We don’t have enormous tape measures or giant scales, so instead we use “standard candles”: objects in space whose brightness we know.
Imagine it is night and you are standing on a long road with a few light poles. These poles all have the same light bulb, but the poles further away are fainter than the nearby ones.
This is because light fades proportionately to distance. If we know the power of the bulb, and can measure how bright the bulb appears to be, we can calculate the distance to the light pole.
For astronomers, a common cosmic light bulb is a kind of exploding star called a Type Ia supernova. These are white dwarf stars which often suck in matter from a neighbouring star and grow until they reach 1.44 times the mass of our Sun, at which point they explode.
By measuring how quickly the explosion fades, we can determine how bright it was and hence how far away from us.
The Dark Energy Survey
The Dark Energy Survey is the largest effort yet to measure dark energy. More than 400 scientists across multiple continents work together for nearly a decade to repeatedly observe parts of the southern sky.
Repeated observations let us look for changes, like new exploding stars. The more often you observe, the better you can measure these changes, and the larger the area you search, the more supernovae you can find.
The first results indicating the existence of dark energy used only a couple of dozen supernovae. The latest results from the Dark Energy Survey use around 1,500 exploding stars, giving much greater precision.
Using a specially built camera installed on the 4-metre Blanco Telescope at the Cerro-Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, the survey found thousands of supernovae of different types.
To work out which ones were Type Ia (the kind needed for measuring distances), the 4-metre Anglo Australian Telescope at Siding Spring Observatory in New South Wales was used.
The Anglo Australian Telescope took measurements which broke up the colours of light from the supernovae. This lets us see a “fingerprint” of the individual elements in the explosion.
Type Ia supernovae have some unique features, like containing no hydrogen and silicon. And with enough supernovae, machine learning allowed the researchers to classify thousands of supernovae efficiently.
More complicated than the cosmological constant
Finally, after more than a decade of work and studying around 1,500 Type Ia supernovae, the Dark Energy Survey has produced a new best measurement of w. It was found that w = -0.80 ± 0.18, so it’s somewhere between -0.62 and -0.98.
This is a very interesting result. It is close to -1, but not quite exactly there. To be the cosmological constant, or the energy of empty space, it would need to be exactly -1.
Where does this leave us?
With the idea that a more complex model of dark energy may be needed, perhaps one in which this mysterious energy has changed over the life of the universe. (The Conversation)

","Astronomers, through the Dark Energy Survey, have made detailed measurements of the properties of dark energy, which constitutes about 70% of the universe. Dark energy is believed to be causing the universe to expand at an ever-increasing rate. The results suggest that dark energy might be a vacuum energy as first proposed by Einstein, or it could be something more complex and dynamic that changes over time. The measurement, represented by the parameter ""w,"" is found to be -0.80 ± 0.18, indicating that dark energy may be close to, but not exactly, the cosmological constant proposed by Einstein",Science and Technology,98,900

The Times of India,1/17/0211,IPL 4: The Gen i bids  ,"This year’s IPL Season 4 is more than just cricket players and locker room gossip. It’s also about
the Gen i who are holding the reins behind the teams
The IPL auction is over. It took the 10 bidders 16 hours and 3.3 billion rupees to decide
who among the 350 players they wanted. Now, the nation awaits the thrills and spills of
the Season 4, and it looks like this season there will be more to watch out for than the
players and their locker room gossips. For, quite unnoticed, IPL has been a young
makeover – Gen i has been slowly, but surely taking over the reins of the teams in many
instances, something that became quite evident during the bidding for Season 4.
They were there last time too, but this time, fronting the negotiations, and almost
becoming the face of their respective teams have been Siddhartha Mallya, Sushanto Roy,
Gayatri Reddy, Akash Ambani. Here’s all the dope on them...
Siddhartha Mallya
Last season, he was at the stands with Deepika Padukone, but this time, expect him to
be in the thick of things, for this whiz kid who says he played “hockey and rugby” in
college is “handling the affairs” of Royal Challengers Bangalore. A suave businessman at
25, this young dude who’s lost oodles of weight, was among the The Times 50 Most
Desirable Men & Women list of The Times of India. He’s already a director on board of his
dad Vijay Mallya’s rollicking business, one of the perks of which is getting to select
models for a calendar shoot! During the auctions, when Kings XI Punjab raised the stakes
for batsman Saurabh Tiwary at the last minute, Siddhartha decided to “have a word” with
Preity, and finally managed to get the batsman for his team.
“It’s a good, overwhelming feeling. One of my first endeavours in India. Just being in the
whole set up – there’s a lot at stake, but it’s good,” he told a channel last year. His dad isWill Sid and Deepika displace Raj and Shilpa as the ‘it’ couple this season?
Gayathri Reddy
The young are known to wear their attitude on their tees, and her’s – the one she wore
for the auction said – ‘Status Symbol’. Guess you won’t miss her in the stands anymore
(you didn’t quite ‘see’ her last time, did you?), for, the lady’s announced her arrival on
the scene! Pretty as a peach, Gayathri partied hard during the last season, but this time,
looks like she means business. Egged on by her brother, she fought for the players she
wanted, and got a balanced team in place. No wonder her media baron dad T
Venkattaram Reddy let her helm things this time. She seems to know the game rather
well, and defended bidding for Daniel Christian saying, “Christian is a good fast bowler
and a decent batsman. He is also a brilliant fielder.”
“I think it’s a good idea to put back all the players into the auction pool, and we also get
the opportunity to retain our key players,” she said last time. “T20 is all about youth and
the majority of our population is 25, and so my being in the game a reflection of that.”
Will she be able to add the much-wanted glam quotient to the game this time?
Sushanto Roy
Sushanto Roy, 34, CEO in his dad Subrata Roy’s company. And now, CEO of Pune
Warriors. A Kirori Mal College graduate, he has loads of experience in real estate. He is
also the man who made “Karishma – The Miracles of Destiny” touted to be the biggest
and costliest TV serials which starred Karisma Kapur, but which had to be pulled off
because of dismal TRPs.
“It was first time for me and before coming to the auction, I felt these are big guys and
big names and will be serious. But it was a lot of fun being with them. It was quite a light-hearted environment even though we were bidding against each other,” said he.
Will be bring bollywood stars to watch his team’s matches?
Akash Ambani
Nita and Mukesh Ambani’s son Akash is a newbie. He sat with his mother through the 16
hours of auction, and has just recently begun to attend the AGMs of his dad’s company.
Akash used to be a Judo lover, guess he doesn’t practice anymore. Is cricket his
newfound love? Anyway, he’s considered to be the lucky mascot for Mumbai Indians, and
was pretty much there for all the matches last season too, and perhaps that’s why Nita
got Akash to sit with her at the tables. This 20-something dressed in business suits on
both the days, but looked really young to be batting for the players he wanted. Also, he
needs to dude up a bit – now, were he do a Mallya junior and lose some weight, gel up
that hair, and get a Bollywood babe to hang on to him, well...
Mum’s the word for him, really!
Will Akash make his presence felt in a big (pun intended) way this time at IPL Season 4,
or do we have to wait for the next season for that?

the hindu,1/2/0014,U.S. to lift cap on intake of medical students,"The United States administration is likely to introduce a bill in the Senate and the Congress to remove the federal cap on the intake of medical students, according to the Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (AAPI), a body of physicians of Indian-origin in India. This would benefit international students, including those from India.

According to Vinod K. Shah of the AAPI, President Barack Obama has assured the association that his government would introduce the bill to add an additional 15,000 residency slots.

This has been a long-standing demand of the AAPI to increase residency slots for medical graduates to facilitate more international students join post-graduate courses, Dr. Shah told journalists at the Global Healthcare Summit here on Saturday.

The maximum intake of students by various U.S. universities at present is 18,000 seats, of which around 16,000 are reserved for the U.S. citizens, leaving only 2,000 for international students.

“If the bill is passed, it will benefit the students from India the most as they constitute about 30 to 40 per cent of the total international students selected to study in the U.S.,” Dr. Shah said.

Recognition of courses

The move is also expected to benefit India as it recently started recognising post-graduate medical courses obtained by Indian-origin students of five countries: the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

“An official notification has been recently passed and included in the gazette to recognise PG medical courses certificates obtained by NRI students from these countries,” Ketan Desai, President of the Medical Council of India, said. The move is to avail the services of students who receive expert training in these countries. They can start practising in India without going through any more tests, Mr. Desai added.

This year, the AAPI has roped in the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (BAPIO) and top-notch Indian medical professional associations to make the summit a truly global one.

The summit will share best practices and experience from leading experts around the world to develop actionable plans for launching demonstration projects. The focus will be on prevention, treatment and management of “priority disease states” in India with measurable metrics to ensure that the plans are viable.

It also aims at bringing together some of the world’s most renowned experts to focus on priority disease states such as allergy, immunology, cardiovascular, diabetes, infectious disease (HIV/AIDS), emergency medicine, mental health, and maternal and child health. The summit will have a wider global perspective with the addition of medical tourism and health information technology.

The hindu,1/2/0021,"Morning Digest: Covishield vaccine gets approval from DCGI’s expert panel, farmers to escalate protest on January 4 if deadlock continues, and more","Covishield Vaccine Approval:
A key decision was taken regarding the approval of the Covishield vaccine, a candidate vaccine developed in partnership by the University of Oxford, Vaccitech, and pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca. A photo shared by the University of Oxford showed a vial of the vaccine, emphasizing the collaborative global efforts in the fight against COVID-19. The approval process for Covishield involved a rigorous review by the Subject Expert Committee (SEC) under the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO). The SEC's marathon meeting, which lasted from the morning until late into the evening, culminated in a recommendation for the approval of Covishield to the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI), which serves as the final approving authority for vaccines and drugs in India.

This approval was a pivotal step in India's vaccination campaign, as Covishield was seen as a key vaccine candidate for inoculating millions in the country. The vaccine had already shown promising results in clinical trials, and with the nod from the SEC and DCGI, it was set to be a crucial tool in combating the pandemic in India.

Farmers' Protests:
Meanwhile, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), a coalition of farmers' unions, held an internal meeting on January 1, 2021, to intensify their protest against the contentious farm laws introduced by the central government. The SKM leaders threatened to escalate their protests if their demands for the repeal of the three agricultural laws were not met. Among the actions they threatened to take were shutting down malls and petrol pumps in Haryana, organizing a tractor march on the Kundli-Manesar highway, and proceeding towards Delhi from Jaipur along the highway.

These threats came amid growing tensions between the farmers and the government, as the farmers remained resolute in their stance against the farm laws, which they believed would undermine their livelihoods. The SKM's planned tractor march was part of a larger strategy to apply pressure on the government to address their demands, further escalating what had already become a significant nationwide protest movement.

These two stories, one concerning the battle against COVID-19 and the other reflecting ongoing social and political tensions in India, underscored the multifaceted challenges the country faced at the start of 2021.","In January 2021, India's Subject Expert Committee (SEC) recommended the approval of the Covishield vaccine, co-developed by the University of Oxford, Vaccitech, and AstraZeneca.

the mint,1/20/0025,TikTok back in US: A look at its India journey and what happened after 2020 ban,"From teenage dancers to grandmothers sharing cooking tips, video-sharing app TikTok has been embraced for its ability to transform an ordinary person into a global celebrity when a video goes viral.
But it is also rife with disinformation, and its Chinese ownership has spurred national security issues in the United States and India in the past.

TikTok was shut down in the US late Saturday as a deadline loomed for its Chinese owners, ByteDance, to sell its US subsidiary to non-Chinese buyers.
But on Sunday, the app restored its service after President-elect Donald Trump promised to issue an executive order delaying the ban. TikTok currently has more than 170 million users in the US.

 Raged over TikTok ban in US, teen sets fire at local Congressman's office
Trump also posted on his Truth Social platform that the United States should take part ownership in TikTok.

In a statement posted on X, TikTok said: ""We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans.""

TikTok’s India journey and govt ban
Indian users had flocked to TikTok as early as 2017. It allowed India’s millions of regional language speakers to share their content and create digital communities. 

However, in 2020, the video-sharing app faced an exodus of users after the Indian government banned it following clashes between Indian and Chinese military officials along the border.

Citing national security concerns, India banned TikTok along with more than 50 other Chinese apps in June 2020.

Till that time, India was TikTok’s biggest overseas market outside of China, with over 200 million users.

The Indian government had used the ban as precedent to crack down upon other digital platforms they deemed to be a threat, said a report by Time.com citing digital rights activists.
","TikTok, the popular video-sharing platform known for transforming ordinary users into viral sensations, faced a temporary shutdown in the U.S. on July 19, 2025, as a deadline approached for Chinese parent company ByteDance to divest its American operations. However, the app resumed service after President-elect Donald Trump announced an executive order delaying the ban, and even suggested that the U.S. should hold a stake in TikTok. The app, with over 170 million U.S. users, thanked Trump for providing “clarity and assurance.” Meanwhile, backlash included an incident where a teenager set fire to a Congressman’s office in protest.

In India, TikTok was banned in June 2020 over national security concerns following border clashes with China. At the time, India was TikTok’s largest foreign market with over 200 million users. The ban led to similar crackdowns on other Chinese apps, sparking debates around digital sovereignty and internet freedom, according to digital rights activists.",International News,151,307
The Economic Times,1/20/0218,Budget 2018 may roll out tax sops for home buyers,"The government may use Budget 2018 to make owning a house slightly more affordable and even rekindle the interest of home buyers. These measures could be in the form of tax sops for home owners and those looking to buy property.

Tax benefits help in bringing down the effective interest burden in properties that are financed through a home loan.

Here are few things that Budget 2018 could do to help taxpayers own a home and save tax simultaneously.

Principal repayment enhancement
In Budget 2018, the tax benefit on the principal amount repaid on a home loan for a self-occupied property may get an additional benefit of Rs 50,000 or more within the section 80C limit. While existing home loan takers can use the prepayment feature to benefit from it, new borrowers get an additional incentive to take home loans.

Interest payment enhancement
Currently, for a self-occupied property, in addition to the tax benefit on the principal amount, the interest paid is deductible up to Rs 2 lakh per annum. In the upcoming budget, we may see an increase in this limit.

Illustratively, on a Rs 40 lakh loan at 8.35 percent for 15 years, the interest paid in the first and second year is nearly Rs 3.28 lakh and Rs 2.90 lakh, respectively. Increasing the limit will help home buyers save more tax and could boost housing demand.

Preconstruction interest
Currently, for an under-construction house, the interest pertaining to pre-construction period is allowed as deduction in five equal annual instalments, commencing from the year in which the house property is acquired or constructed. Thus, total deduction available to the taxpayer under section 24(b) on account of interest will be 1/5th of interest pertaining to pre-construction period + Interest pertaining to the post construction period.

For someone buying an under construction property for self-use, this limit may be a dampener. On Rs 40 lakh loan, the total interest paid over 5 years could be nearly Rs 7.5 lakh and it can be split in 5 equal instalments before taking tax benefit from the year of possession of the house. Even though the interest portion is high in the initial years of the loan and comes down later on, the annual instalment amount along with the interest paid for that year (post possession) could easily cross the Rs 2-lakh limit of section 24 especially on loans above Rs 25 lakh.

On a higher loan amount, such a limit is restrictive and a borrower may not get full tax benefit on the interest paid. Increasing this limit could help tax payers save more tax.

Loss from house property
For a house that is let-out on rent, Budget 2017 had changed the tax incidence for them. From FY 2017-18, the 'loss from house property' was restricted to Rs 2 lakh per annum for rented houses and 'deemed to be let-out' houses. There could be an increase in the Rs 2 lakh-limit announced in previous budget.

This move put a limit to the amount of interest a person pays on his home loan that can claimed as a set off (in case of 'rented/deemed to be rented' house). This, thereby, has effectively reduced the tax benefit an individual gets from interest paid on a home loan. However, the unadjusted loss from house property can be carried forward for eight assessment years but can only be set off against income from house property.

Real estate and GST
Real estate still does not come under the ambit of Goods and Services Tax (GST).. However, construction activities including residential structures will attract GST of 12 percent. This makes under-construction projects costlier than a ready-to-move-in home. As per the CBEC (Central Board of Excise and Customs), ""Sale of building is an activity or consideration which is neither a supply of goods nor a supply of services."" This makes the ready-to-move-in properties lucrative compared with under-construction ones.

According to Surendra Hiranandani, CMD, House of Hiranandani, ""In the GST regime, the input tax credit is available on taxes paid on materials bought for construction which can be adjusted against the GST liability, the effective tax rate post adjustment is quite high as compared to the old rate of 5.5 percent. Further, stamp duty continues to remain in force even after implementation of GST and the rates vary from state to state which increases the costs for the consumer. We hope that state governments abolish the same or merge with the existing GST rates.""

Section 80EE reintroduction
Home buyers who took loans in FY 2016-17 were allowed to take an additional tax benefit of up to Rs 50,000 under Section 80EE of the Income Tax Act, subject to certain conditions. The deduction is over and above the limit of Rs 2 lakh, provided it is for a self-occupied property. Although not available in the FY 2017-18, this benefit could be reintroduced in FY 2018-19, with modifications.

Here are the conditions that have to be met to avail the addition tax benefit:
o The additional deduction in respect to interest on loan taken would be applicable only for residential house property;
o It is available only for first-time home buyers;
o The maximum benefit is capped at Rs 50,000 a year;
o The value of the house property cannot exceed Rs 50 lakh;
o The loan amount cannot exceed Rs 35 lakh;
o The loan has to be sanctioned between April 1, 2016 and March 31, 2017.

Those who have already taken the loan, as per the conditions above, can continue to avail of the tax benefits in the later assessment years. If Budget 2018 reintroduces it for the FY 2018-19, home buyers stand to gain.","In the upcoming Indian Budget 2018, tax sops for home owners and prospective property buyers could be implemented to make owning a house more affordable and to encourage home-buying. Possible measures include an increase in the tax benefit on the principal amount repaid on a home loan for a self-occupied property, a potential increase in the deduction limit for interest payments on home loans, an enhancement of the deduction for preconstruction interest, and an increase in the limit for the loss from house property for rented houses.

The Indian Express,1/21/0201,‘No new cases of Avian flu in Vadodara’,"Ten days after Vadodara district reported its first confirmed case of bird flu after three of the five samples of crows found dead in Savli tested positive, the Vadodara animal husbandry department on Thursday said that the H5N8 strain now “appears to have weakened” as no new cases of avian flu or mortality have come forth.

Animal husbandry officer for Vadodara Dr Prakash Darji told this newspaper that while 34 teams of the department have been making daily rounds of the eight taluka heads of the district, no new mortality or suspected avian flu cases have been found.

“Our teams are going on a daily round of the talukas to keep a tab on the situation and so far we have not come across any more mortalities among birds after the incident of pigeons found dead in Kia village of Karjan ten days ago. The report of the pigeons and two peacock carcasses were negative. So, we can say, at the moment, that the avian flu outbreak was restricted to Vasantpura in Savli taluka of the district where the crows died on January 10,” Darji said, adding that some samples of backyard poultry also tested negative for the virus.","Ten days after Vadodara district reported its first confirmed bird flu case with three crow samples testing positive for the H5N8 strain, the Vadodara animal husbandry department said on Thursday that the virus now “appears to have weakened.” No new avian flu cases or bird deaths have been reported since.

The Times of India,1/22/1014,Police to beef up vigil in desolate zones after dark,"KOLKATA: A vast zone of the city that bustles with activity in the morning becomes desolate and risky, especially for women, after dark. This is the business zone, most of which is non-residential. Police are now trying to increase human surveillance in these areas.
Areas like BBD Bag, Esplanade, Garden Reach, Metiabruz, parts of Kidderpore, Maidan, Beliaghata and areas in and around Sealdah and Kolkata stations are completely deserted after 10pm and turn into hubs of criminals and hooligans. ""Roads like Indira Gandhi Sarani, Dufferin Road, Strand Road, Outram Road, Eden Gardens Road,
Queens Way, Hospital Road, Lovers Lane, Kyd Street are completely desolate at night. Movement of people is negligible and that makes these areas very risky,"" admitted a police officer.Joint CP (headquarters) Rajeev Mishra said: ""We have indentified some areas of Kolkata (that are vulnerable) and we are thinking of planning the police vigilance system in a new way."" When asked about details of the plan,Mishra said: ""We will increase police posting and strengthen the surveillance system as much as possible, but I cannot divulge the details.""
However, senior officers at Lalbazar said CCTV vigilance cannot stop crimes but only detect them and so, to truly have an effect, manual watch should be enhanced. But, here lies the main problem - that of staff strength, said a senior officer of Kolkata Police. It is very hard to man such a big area with only a 40,000-strong force, the officer explained. Previously, there was a Radio Flying Squad (RFS) that used to move around on patrol vans only to keep a watch on the streets. Each van consisted of an officer, two constables apart from the driver and they used to constantly update police stations about activities in their areas. This helped police stations to take action quickly. Recently, this RFS has been broken to provide additional force to added areas.
""RFS was like the eyes and ears of police stations, but now police stations have to depend solely on their patrol force and city watch sections,"" the officer said.
Police to beef up vigil in desolate zones after dark - Times of India

Each police station has two to three patrol vans and three to four motorbikes for 'city watch', but that is not adequate to cover a large area. ""Most police stations cover an area of 25-30sqkm and the entire area cannot be covered with only two or three vans. Moreover, we don't have adequate staff because most of the policemen have to look after law and order and investigation at the same time,"" said an officer of Hare Street police station.
""We have started checking vehicles. Previously, we used to do it once a week, but now we have decided to increase the checking mechanism. Though after 10pm it's 'fewer-vehicles time', it's at this time when some vehicles are used for anti-social activities and that needs to be examined. We have also decided to post policemen at all kiosks even at night,"" said DC (traffic) Dilip Kumar Ad","Kolkata's business zones, desolate and unsafe after dark, are seeing increased police surveillance to combat rising crime. Vulnerable areas include BBD Bag, Esplanade, and Sealdah . Police plan to enhance human surveillance due to limited CCTV effectiveness, despite challenges of understaffing.

THE ARUNACHAL TIMES,1/23/0022,World Bank approves Rs 1000 cr loan to help people get Bengal govt services,"World Bank approves Rs 1000 cr loan to help people get Bengal govt services
January 23, 2022
New Delhi, Jan 22 (PTI): The World Bank has approved a loan of around Rs 1,000 crore to the West Bengal government primarily to support its effort to help the poor and vulnerable groups access its social protection services.

According to a statement released by the state government on Saturday, the loan will help the administration improve services such as medical help through telemedicine, support for the elderly and differently-abled, financial inclusion of citizens with digital payments and disbursement of benefits for public schemes.

“The World Bank on January 19 has sanctioned a $125 million (about Rs 1,000 crore) loan to the government of West Bengal to support the state’s effort to help the poor and vulnerable groups access social protection services,” the statement read.

The loan under the ‘West Bengal Building State Capability for Inclusive Social Protection’ operation will strengthen the capability of this state to expand coverage and access to social assistance and targeted service for poor and vulnerable groups, it said.

When contacted, a top official of the West Bengal government said, “This loan will strengthen the state’s capability to expand its coverage and reach out to the thousands of poor people with its welfare programmes.” The Mamata Banerjee government runs over 400 programmes that provide social assistance, protection, care services and jobs, the statement said.

The Hindu,1/26/1018,Uncapped players set for a fat purse,"As some of the big names in the Indian Premier League (IPL) horizon go under the hammer after a long time, the likes of Chris Gayle, Kieron Pollard and R. Ashwin will steal the limelight over the next two days during the player auction.

But for the first time, the uncapped domestic cricketers are likely to be chased as desperately as the international stars by all the eight franchises.

In fact, so sought-after are some of the top domestic players that in all likelihood the next two days will witness the highest price tag for an uncapped player in the history of the IPL, eclipsing the sum of ₹8.5 crore paid by Delhi Daredevils for Pawan Negi in 2016.

Ever since the domestic uncapped players were included in the auction pool, multiple players have earned bids much higher than many regulars on the international circuit.

And the Baroda all-rounder duo of Krunal Pandya and Deepak Hooda will be on the wish-list of virtually all the teams.Higher purse

Hooda, who was sold to Sunrisers Hyderabad for ₹4.2 crore after Rajasthan Royals was suspended, recently had a feel of the India dressing room during the T20 series against Sri Lanka last month but did not get a game, while Krunal, the older brother of Hardik, will surely fetch a sum much higher than his last auction purse of ₹2 crore.

Despite Mumbai Indians having an option to exercise the ‘Right to Match’ option for the all-rounder, Krunal could go for a sum closer to his younger brother’s retention amount of ₹11 crore. The same is the case with Hooda, who is one of the biggest hitters in domestic cricket.

Tamil Nadu all-rounder Vijay Shankar will also not be too far in the list as the middle-order batsman and medium-pacer is on the radar of multiple teams.

Young guns

Besides, fast bowlers Basil Thampi and Aniket Choudhary are also expected to add a few zeroes to their worth come Sunday. Also, a plethora of India’s current under-19 squad may join the list. Batsmen Prithvi Shaw, Himanshu Rana and Shubman Gill are set to pocket eight-figure contracts along with all-rounder Kamlesh Nagarkoti and pace bowlers Shivam Mavi and Aditya Thakare.

One of the main reasons for the domestic uncapped players being in demand is the fact that at least three teams are set to undergo a virtual overhaul of their squads.

Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab have indicated their decision to form a new team while Delhi Daredevils is expected to continue with its recent tradition of a makeover to the squad every season.

It could result in the domestic uncapped players — along with Australia batsman D’Arcy Short and England all-rounder Jofra Archer, who has earlier featured in an Under-19 World Cup for the West Indies — becoming household names over the weekend.","In the IPL 2023 auction, uncapped domestic cricketers are anticipated to attract as much attention as international stars. The Baroda duo, Krunal Pandya and Deepak Hooda, may command significant sums, potentially surpassing previous records. Young talents like Vijay Shankar, Basil Thampi, and Aniket Choudhary, along with members of India's under-19 squad, are expected to secure lucrative contracts. The demand for domestic players is driven by squad overhauls planned by Rajasthan Royals, Kings XI Punjab, and Delhi Daredevils, promising an exciting weekend for cricket enthusiasts.",Sports,84,471
Hindustan times,1/27/0233,Centre rolls out first nasal vax as booster,"New Delhi : India on Thursday rolled out the first nasal vaccine against Covid-19, to be administered as a primary or booster dose for adults, potentially widening the pool of people who may take a third vaccine against the infection, cutting tertiary costs, and easing pressures on supply and storage networks.

The vaccine, manufactured by Bharat Biotech and branded iNCOVACC, was launched by Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya and science minister Jitendra Singh, and will initially be available only at private facilities, where it will cost ₹800 for a spray.

In a statement, Bharat Biotech said the vaccine was designed to be economical and is targeted at low- and middle-income countries.

“As a needle-less vaccination, Bharat Biotech’s iNCOVACC will be world’s first such booster dose. India will now have more options when it comes to third doses or precautionary doses,” said the Hyderabad-based firm, which also manufactures Covaxin, one of the two key intravenous jabs that form the bulk of India’s national Covid-19 inoculation programme.

“A roll-out of iNCOVACC is expected to begin in private hospitals that have placed advance orders. Initial manufacturing capacity of several million doses per annum has been established, this can be scaled up to a billion doses as required,” the firm added.

The vaccine has been approved for use as a primary series vaccine and heterologous booster in India.

“Being the world’s first intranasal Covid-19 vaccine, this marks a glorious tribute to the call for Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India),” Mandaviya said during the launch.

On December 24 last year, India’s technical expert panel on immunisation — the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) — recommended that the vaccine be used as a precautionary dose for adults.

The vaccine has been developed by the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, US, and licensed for manufacturing and distribution by Bharat Biotech and another American company , Precision Biologics.

Experts are hopeful of its utility since it is easy to administer, and is a new inoculation -- factors that could help overcome hesitancy around booster doses. Around 716 million of 940 million adults in India are yet to take the third dose of a Covid-19, according to data analysed by HT.

Scientists and health experts have long viewed nasal vaccines as a vital means to end the pandemic. These sprays aim to protect the site that the Sars-CoV-2 virus first targets — the nasal pathway. The vaccine paints the mucous membrane in the nasal pathway with a layer of antibodies, preventing an infection at the very source.

Conventional vaccines work differently: they trigger antibodies that circulate in the bloodstream; these antibodies are best suited to preventing the disease from taking hold, but are usually unable to avert an infection or transmission.

The company said iNCOVACC was evaluated in phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials involving over 3,000 participants with successful results.

Administered as a nasal spray, it does not require syringes, needles, alcohol wipes, bandages, etc, saving costs related to procurement, distribution, storage, and biomedical waste disposal, routine requirements for intravenous injections.

The company also said that clinical trials and extensive humoral and cell-mediated responses were conducted to evaluate the vaccine as a primary dose schedule, and as heterologous booster dose for people who have previously received two doses of the Covaxin and Covishield, the most widespread Covid-19 vaccines administered in India.

“iNCOVACC recipients demonstrated significant levels of Mucosal IgA antibody levels (measured in the saliva). Mucosal IgA antibodies in the upper respiratory tract may provide benefits in reducing infections and transmission,” said the company.

The vaccine can be stored in a regular refrigerator temperature of 2-8°C, making it easy to store and distribute across the country.

“Nasal vaccines might be able to prevent even asymptomatic Covid because it generates local IgA antibodies (first line of defence), cutting chain of transmission and possibly bringing an end to this pandemic,” said senior immunologist Dr Narinder Kumar Mehra.

According to the company, the vector-based platform can be easily updated with emerging variants for mass production within a few months.

“Despite the lack of demand for Covid-19 vaccines, Bharat Biotech continued product development in intranasal vaccines, to be well-prepared with platform technologies for future infectious diseases. Bharat Biotech has also initiated development of variant-specific vaccines for COVID in an attempt to be future ready,” it said.","India launched iNCOVACC, the world's first nasal Covid-19 vaccine, developed by Bharat Biotech. Priced at ₹800 per spray, it targets low- and middle-income countries, approved for primary and booster doses.

The vaccine underwent successful clinical trials involving over 3,000 participants, demonstrating efficacy. Its vector-based platform allows easy updating with emerging variants, while storage at regular refrigerator temperatures simplifies distribution. iNCOVACC offers a cost-effective, easily administered solution to combat the pandemic, with potential to ease supply and storage pressures, advancing India's self-reliance in vaccine production.",Health and Wellness,99,719
hindustan times,1/28/0020,Centre puts entire stake of Air India on sale,"The government on Monday announced a plan to sell its entire stake in Air India, renewing its attempt to sell the state-owned airline after a similar move in 2018 failed to attract any bidder.

A document released by the government on Monday invited initial expressions of interest (EOI) in the airline and set March 17 as the deadline for the submissions. The Air India Specific Alternative Mechanism (AISAM), headed by Union home minister Amit Shah, approved the release of the preliminary information memorandum (PIM) for inviting EOI for the disinvestment move.

Civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri said the airline was a “great asset” and its position was “fragile” due to heavy debt. He said Air India, as a brand, will continue to fly but it needs to be privatised.

“Due to its accumulated debt of about ₹60,000 crore, its financial position is in a very fragile condition and Air India is currently under a debt trap. Any private investor can turn it around and make Air India a profitable venture by bringing operational as well as financial efficiencies. The government has limited financial resources whereas the private investor can bring the required capital to make it turnaround. We hope and wish that Air India remains a vibrant airline and fly forever,” Puri said.

Monday’s announcement only marks the first of a multi-stage process. The government has given time till February 11 for the submission of written queries on PIM and the share purchase agreement (SPA) while the last date for submission of the expression of interest is March 17. It will announce the qualified bidders on March 31 following which the Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued. The government has not yet announced the date for the RFP stage.

he move is also a politically contentious one.The Congress criticised the Centre over the move. “The sale of Air India has been going on for the last six years since 2014 when this government assumed office. A special group of ministers (GoM) was formed to look into it. Five ministers deliberated on it. If the government seriously wants to sell Air India, they should look for a real investor and have to go for a real strategic sale. The government has been misleading on the issue,” Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said.

CPI general secretary D Raja blamed the government’s “bad policies” and maintained that the national carrier has the potential to emerge as a powerhouse in the aviation sector.

Experts also said the timing of the Centre’s move amid an economic slowdown could pose a challenge.

“While divestment is a positive step, it has to be when you have a strong platform, not with a wobbly economic base. After the first failed attempt, it makes sense for the government to divest and find a company that can help make the Maharaja stronger... And this should be done especially when we have a positive economic climate. At the moment, the investment sentiment with India is not conducive… There are several external risk factors also in aviation such as oil prices, the Iranian crisis and the corona virus outbreak, etc.,” said Mark Martin, founder and CEO of Martin Consulting, an aviation consultancy.

As part of the strategic disinvestment, Air India plans to sell its entire stake in Air India Express and 50% shareholding in equal joint venture Air India SATS Airport Services (AISATS). All the three will be sold together and management control of the national carrier will be transferred to the investor, the government said. The government previously offered only 76% of its stake for sale.

In November, Puri told Parliament that the national carrier, which loses ₹26 crore a day, would have to shut down if it was not privatised. In 2018-19, Air India’s net loss was provisionally estimated at ₹8,556.35 crore. It has a debt of over ₹60,000 crore, half of which has already been taken out of the books and parked in a special purpose vehicle, Air India Assets Holding Ltd.

In its latest plan, the government will target selling its entire stake in the airline and 50% of a ground handling unit. The successful bidder will have to take only a debt of ₹23,286.5 crore (the 2018 offer required them to take on a little over ₹33,000 crore) , while the liabilities will be decided depending on current assets at the time of closing of the transaction, according to the PIM. The remaining amount of the total ₹60,074 crore debt, as on March 31, 2019, will be transferred to the special purpose vehicle. The firm’s land and buildings at the Delhi and Mumbai airports and the corporate office, which are core assets for running the airline, will be given to the new investor on a right-to-use basis for a limited period, the document added.

Puri said that after no bids were received for the national carrier in the first attempt made in 2018, the government learnt its “lessons and analysed critical areas to make the current disinvestment bid more attractive to the prospective Interested Bidders (IBs)”. The government in 2018 called bids for a 76% stake sale in Air India including 100% in subsidiary Air India Express and 50% holding in ground handling company AISATS but failed to get even a single bid amid reports of a consortium of Indigo (Interglobe Aviation) and Qatar Airways being interested.

Air India and Air India Express had combined revenue of ₹30,632 crore in 2018-19, which is the highest among Indian carriers, Puri said.

The government said it was committed to paying certain employee-related dues before the closing of transaction. The total employee strength of the two companies is 17,984, out of which 9,617 are permanent employees. About 36% of the permanent employees will be retiring in the next five years, Puri said.

The government has relaxed the bidding norms wherein net worth for potential bidders is fixed at ₹3,500 crore and minimum stake for an individual consortium partner is lowered to 10%. The net worth criterion was ₹5,000 crore in the 2018 bid document.

Another key change is that an entity can put in a bid on the “strength of its parent”, which means that an entity floated by a big corporate can participate in the disinvestment process, a person aware of the PIM details told Press Trust of India.

Staff dues of about ₹1,383.70 crore on account of Justice Dharmadhikari Commission’s recommendation on past arrears will be paid by the government.

As per the conditions decided by AISAM, the liabilities to be retained in Air India will be equal to certain current and non-current assets.","The Indian government has announced its intention to sell its entire stake in Air India, renewing its efforts to privatize the state-owned airline. This move comes after a similar attempt in 2018 failed to attract any bidders. The government has invited initial expressions of interest, with a deadline for submissions set for March 17.

Tuticorin town remained on edge on Wednesday. The police opened fire in the afternoon after two of their buses were torched by some relatives of the victims who were waiting outside a hospital to receive the bodies.

Many of the relatives got involved in an altercation with the police over the decision to conduct post- mortems without their concurrence.

When the police resorted to a lathicharge to disperse them, the protesters set ablaze the two buses. According to unofficial reports, at least one person was killed and five injured in the fresh firing.

The police took out a flag march on Wednesday afternoon to ensure peace.

Although the protest is being held for the past 100 days demanding the closure of the existing copper unit over allegations that the factory was causing illness and had contaminated the groundwater, affecting farming within a 50km radius, the dam burst on Tuesday.

More than 20,000 people, including a large number of fishermen, marched towards the collectorate on Tuesday.

The police said they opened fire after the protesters torched 30 vehicles and vandalised the collectorate.

Chief minister Palanisamy maintained that the police firing had become unavoidable.

The Opposition parties have slammed the AIADMK government for "" total failure of law and order "" . They have demanded the resignation of the chief minister.

Congress president Rahul Gandhi dubbed the police firing "" state- sponsored terrorism "" , alleging that "" Tamilians are massacred because they are not bowing to the RSS "" . He asserted that "" the RSS cannot silence Tamilians "" . M. K. Stalin, the working president of the Opposition DMK, alleged that the police used assault rifles and automatic weapons.

Kamal Haasan, actor and chief of the newly launched Makkal Neethi Mayyam, visited Tuticorin hospital on Wednesday morning to enquire about the condition of those injured in the police firing.

He wanted to know who ordered the firing on "" peaceful processionists "" . A case was registered against Haasan for visiting the hospital despite prohibitory orders.","The Madras High Court has issued a stay that is expected to delay Vedanta group company Sterlite Copper's plans to build a second copper smelter in Tuticorin, Tamil Nadu, for at least four months. The move follows public opposition, with residents of 18 villages and fisherfolk demanding a halt to the expansion. The court has directed the Centre to submit a report after holding a public hearing in the district to gather opinions on the expansion plan. The Tamil Nadu government has also set up an inquiry commission to investigate the circumstances leading to police firing that resulted in at least 12 deaths.",National News,103,526
The Telegraph,1/3/0006,Automobile sales hit the slow lane ,"



According to year-end figures released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), car sales growth dropped to just 6.9 per cent in 2005 from 24.6 per cent at the end of December 2004.

Many carmakers in India, including Tata Motors, saw demand slowing down during the year. There were other factors like the floods in Maharashtra and Gujarat and stricter emission norms, which hit the demand. The emission norms had led to price rise.

Total car sales in 2005 stood at 8.58 lakh units against 8.02 units in 2004. Utility vehicles and multi-purpose vehicles also could not insulate themselves from the slowdown, with sales growth dropping to 8.9 per cent and 3.5 per cent respectively from as high as 25.3 per cent and 11.6 per cent in 2004.

For commercial vehicles, a massive slowdown in demand for medium-and heavy commercial vehicles saw overall growth wilting to 9.04 per cent in 2005 from 28.3 per cent in 2004. This segment was worst hit as sales growth dropped to a low of 3.7 per cent from 28.6 per cent. A total of 1.97 lakh units were sold in 2005 against 1.9 lakh units in 2004.

Motorcycles sales continued their blazing run, although scooters and mopeds remained a pale shadow.

Motorcycles sales in 2005 grew 17 per cent to 55.7 lakh from 47.5 lakh in 2004. Even as the growth rate declined by around 2 per cent year-on-year, 2005 figures were no mean achievement as the base was high. Scooter sales, which had been looking up for sometime on account of Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India, went into negative growth, ironically because of the same factor","Car sales growth in India fell to 6.9% in 2005, down from 24.6% in 2004, due to lower demand, floods, and stricter emission norms.

Utility and multi-purpose vehicles also saw slower growth: 8.9% and 3.5%, respectively.

Commercial vehicle growth plunged to 9.04% from 28.3%; worst-hit were medium and heavy vehicles at 3.7% growth.

Motorcycle sales remained strong, up 17% to 55.7 lakh units, despite a slightly lower growth rate.

Scooter sales declined, impacted by production issues at Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India.

Times of India,1/3/0202,"‘Indu Mills had devpt potential of Rs 3,600cr’","MUMBAI: The National Textiles Corporation said its 12.5-acre Indu Mills property at Prabhadevi, which Prime Minister Manmohan Singh agreed to hand over to the state free of cost, had a development potential of around Rs 3,600 crore.
Last week, the PM assured a state delegation, led by chief minister Prithviraj Chavan, that the sea-facing property would be allotted for a memorial for B R Ambedkar.
NTC officials are tight-lipped because of the sensitivities involved; all that they divulged was that their valuation of this prime property came to around Rs 300 crore per acre. However, a senior state official debunked the NTC figure, saying the property could not be worth that much, given the existing ready reckoner rate for land in that area. The bureaucrat said the plot was reserved only for industrial use and so, there was no question for commercial exploitation. “The FSI for industrial use is 1,” he said, adding the proposed memorial would have a substantial part of the land reserved for a park, to be open to the public.

The official said there were several ways NTC could be compensated, including giving it an equivalent area outside the city. Another option could be to offer the transfer of development rights or TDR to NTC. This TDR could be exploited in the suburbs. But civic officials said TDR could only be sanctioned if a civic amenity was created on the surrendered plot.

According to sources, the Indu Mills was one of the finest parcels of land in the island city; rates in a nearby high-end residential tower are being currently quoted at Rs 70,000 a sq ft.

The NTC had plans to build a luxury hotel and commercial complex there to garner revenue to revive its sick units elsewhere. The original understanding between the state and NTC was that the latter would surrender four acres for the Ambedkar memorial. As compensation, NTC was to receive extra construction rights on the eight acres.


The plan had to be change after supporters of Republican Sena forcibly occupied the mill premises on December 6. When the NTC approached the HC following the state’s failure to act against the “encroachers”, the court rapped the government for its inaction. On December 22, the state informed the court that it had persuaded the squatters inside Indu Mills to vacate within a week and if they did not, they would be evicted. Last week, after meeting the PM, Chavan said a panel comprising Union ministries of environment and forests, urban development and textiles officials and state government representatives would be formed to resolve the issue","The National Textiles Corporation's (NTC) 12.5-acre Indu Mills property in Prabhadevi, valued at around Rs 3,600 crore, is set to be handed over to the Maharashtra state government free of cost for a B.R. Ambedkar memorial. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh assured this to a delegation led by Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan. Despite NTC valuing the land at Rs 300 crore per acre, a state official contested this figure, noting the land is reserved for industrial use with an FSI of 1. Various compensation methods for NTC are under consideration, including providing alternative land or Transfer of Development Rights (TDR). The original plan to use four acres for the memorial and compensate NTC with extra construction rights on the remaining land changed after supporters of Republican Sena occupied the premises, prompting court intervention.

With this purpose, the state BJP has started wooing them by highlighting the alleged harsh financial measures taken by the Congress led state government so far.
As a party identified with the interests of traders class, it is no surprise that the party has started unfolding its poll agenda by concentrating on the dissatisfaction among these sections. As a first step, Punjab BJP chief Avinash Rai Khanna addressed a meeting of traders organised by Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal in the city on Saturday evening. Khanna candidly told TNN that this was part of their agenda for the coming poll. Talking in poll mode, he held out a promise of his party for doing its best for the welfare of trade and industry so that it may work in tax friendly environment and progress. This issue was deliberated recently in the extended meeting of the state BJP headed by Khanna
The state BJP finance secretary Ashok Juneja said that they would focus on the VAT issue which had generated a lot of heat. The state witnessed a prolonged stir in which the trade and affected small-scale industrial units, particularly the hosiery ones stopped production against its implementation for prolonged period. There are host of issues the party would take up like imposition of exim forms, entry tax and increase in sales tax on de-oiled rice bran, petrol and mobile oil. The party would also highlight that the way these measures have implemented has only added to the woes of the traders and entrepreneurs. Juneja claimed that information collection centres set up by the state government have ended up as barriers. The vehicles carrying goods are detained on flimsy clerical and technical mistakes, he said. The BJP is all set to exploit the resentment prevailing over large-scale sales tax raids. The party is of the view that this is adversely affecting trade and industry which is already passing through recession. In a typical poll bait, state BJP has decided to highlight what BJP led NDA government did for trade and industry. The Union Finance minister Jaswant Singh has made the income tax department as tax payer friendly where persuasive measures are adopted for increasing revenue. The speedy issuance of refunds and reduction of forms required for different formalities are proposed to be highlighted. The BJP is also eyeing to exploit the issue related to removal of octroi. The SAD-BJP government had removed octroi but the Congress led government is silent on this issue despite promise made in its election manifesto, he said. The party would focus on various relief measures taken during the previous SAD-BJP tenure. The sales tax laws were made trade and industry friendly by introducing summary assessment scheme, deemed assessment, abolishing ST-XXIl-A forms and removing sales tax barriers, claimed Juneja.","In preparation for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, the Punjab BJP has begun implementing its election agenda by addressing issues related to trade and industry in the state.

I can’t really judge how his trip would have been, had he come to Kolkata.” On the sidelines of an event here, she said: “These kinds of religious intolerance are dangerous for a secular country like India. Small groups can hold a country hostage. It is very important to create a general attitude against such things.”

Dr. Ptaff said: “People should learn from Netaji’s Indian National Army how to co-exist as different communities and religious groups.”

The Times Of India,1/4/0204,SAU different: Brand Brain Box with a Heart,"Start with the soothing silky feel of saris from Bangladesh, throw in a dash of Urdu poetry from Pakistan, weave in
the rich carpets of Nepal along with the aromatic teas of Sri Lanka.
Pepper it with the white beaches of Maldives and top it with the sheer brain power of Indian geeks. Mix all this to
create a heady product with a â€˜Made in South Asia'' stamp. Sounds good? Will this brand create waves?
It would, feel experts. ""Brand South Asia would be Brand Brain Box,"" says ad guru Alyque Padamsee.
""South Asian countries may be Third World economies, but they form a first class think tank. The biggest import
of the West is South Asian brain power. In Silicon Valley, the majority of companies are owned by Indians,
Pakistanis and Sri Lankans. Similarly, the Indus Entrepreneurs (TIE), an association of South Asian entrepreneurs
in the US, is a powerful voice,"" he explains.
If South Asians are known for their brains, they are also known for wearing their hearts â€” and family values â€”
on their sleeves. ""Family values are the other major USP of the region and it''s bound to impress the Western
world as well,"" feels Padamsee.
Brand Emotion, or Brand Family, finds many takers among experts. ""The distinctive South Asian culture makes us
stand apart from the cold, matter-of-fact way of life in the West,"" says Piyush Pandey, creative director, O&M.
""Finally, the ethnic lifestyle, which includes alternative Asian therapies or fiery Asian diets, will attract Western
markets.""

common trading commodities and present a unified high-quality brand â€” like South Asian Tea or South Asian
Textiles, it will go a long way.
According to Chef Sanjeev Kapoor, Brand Passion is our main USP. If South Asian foods are marketed on a
combined platter to the world, it will set trends, he says.
""The reason why the West has so many food chains while we don''t is that we don''t believe in emotionless,
mechanised cooking. Our cooking is both, passionate and bold. While the Italians or the French stop at one herb
in a dish, we fearlessly use 15 types of spices in one curry,"" he says. ""A South Asia Union with no trade restrictions
will help in the growth of all our cuisines.""
Even in field of arts and entertainment the region has myriad hues, which can be amalgamated to present a
unified brand, say experts. But this would need a fine balancing act.
As filmmaker Shyam Benegal says: ""Pakistani poetry, Bangladeshi songs and Sri Lankan dances can hold their
own anywhere. But there''s a danger of India playing the bully and presenting Bollywood as Brand Asia. That will
be unfortunate.""
Most experts feel the West would feel competitive, if not threatened, by the South Asia brand. However, Pandey
says, ""The West has always been interested in the subcontinent. And if a common thread emerges from it in the
form of a single brand, they would gain too. Trading with, or travelling through the Union, with a single currency
makes life easier. After all, Brand South Asia shouldn''t be about power, but about making life better.""
Piali Banerjee","The concept of ""Brand South Asia"" combines the cultural richness and intellectual prowess of the region to create a unique identity. It emphasizes the brainpower of South Asians, their strong family values, and distinctive lifestyle. Experts foresee potential in unified branding efforts, such as promoting South Asian foods, textiles, and arts internationally. However, there's a caution against overshadowing diverse cultural elements with dominant forces like Bollywood. While some anticipate Western competition, others believe collaboration could benefit both regions. Ultimately, the goal of Brand South Asia is to enhance lives through cultural exchange and economic cooperation, rather than exerting power.",Entertainment,99,556

becomes shriller and things begin to fly!
Pure atheists (untouched by
spirituality) such as Richard Dawkins,
who once called himself Darwin’s
Rottweiler, like to use evolution to
debunk or discredit religion.
Hard-core religionists return the favour
by proclaiming their faith as being
incompatible with any science that rejects or circumvents a literal reading of
the Bible’s Book of Genesis. Notwithstanding such extremes, a significant
portion (24 per cent) of the population looked upon religion and evolution as
compatible entities. Nor were scientists averse to accepting some sort of
higher power or deity (51 per cent).
Dr Francis Collins, the scientist who headed the US government’s first human
genome project, believes, for example, that evolution complemented faith.
Others such as the late paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould looked upon faith
and science as two mutually exclusive or non-overlapping magesteria.
In a postscript to this famous essay, Gould dedicated the piece to the memory
of his late friend, Carl Sagan, who also shared his “personal suspicion” about
the non-existence of souls, adding that he could not think of a better reason
for hoping that they were wrong than the prospect of spending an eternity
roaming the cosmos in friendship and conversation with this wonderful soul!
","A Pew Research Center survey reveals that 60% of Americans accept evolution, though debates between atheists and religious individuals intensify the discourse. Richard Dawkins, an atheist, uses evolution to challenge religion, while some religionists reject non-literal biblical interpretations. Nonetheless, 24% see evolution and religion as compatible. Scientists, including Dr. Francis Collins, sometimes integrate faith with science, while others like Stephen Jay Gould maintain they are separate domains.",International News,67,313

The Free Press Journal,1/7/0024,HERE COMES THE SUN,"With Aditya-L1, XPoSAT and Chandrayaan-3, India has hit a celestial hat-trick in its quest to better understand the mysteries of the solar system and the universe.

Viewed as a God by saints and the richest source of energy that sustains life on earth by scientists, the Sun will now be under the close scrutiny of Aditya-L1.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised the country’s scientists. “India creates yet another landmark. India’s first solar observatory Aditya-L1 reaches its destination. It is a testament to the relentless dedication of our scientists in realising among the most complex and intricate space missions. I join the nation in applauding this extraordinary feat. We will continue to pursue new frontiers of science for the benefit of humanity,” he wrote in a post on X.

Aditya L1, India’s first space-based observatory to study the Sun, was placed in a halo-shaped orbit around the Sun-Earth Lagrange Point 1 at the designated time on Saturday.

The point is around 1.5 million km from the Earth, in the direction of the Sun.

Lagrange points, named after French mathematician and astronomer Joseph-Louis Lagrange, are unique locations in space where the gravitational forces of two massive bodies nearly neutralise each other. Though it is tough to park the spacecraft around these points because of the two gravitational forces at play, it requires less fuel to pin it to the place.

Understanding the Sun is not important for India alone. Aditya-L1 is also for the whole of the world – S Somanath, ISRO chairman

Aditya L1 has been placed precisely in the orbit and that the prediction of the velocity requirement was correct, said Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) chairman S Somanath. “Based on our calculations, it is in the right place. We will monitor for a few hours and make corrections, if necessary. We don’t expect that to happen,” he said. “Understanding the Sun is not important for India alone. Adiya-L1 is also for the whole of the world. We look forward to scientific outcomes. At least five years of life is guaranteed with the fuel left in the satellite,” he said.

From its vantage point around L1, Aditya L1 will have a continuous and uninterrupted view of the sun for the next five years. “The insertion of Aditya-L1 into this Halo orbit presents a critical mission phase, which demanded precise navigation and control. A successful insertion further involved constant monitoring along with the adjustment of the spacecraft's speed and position by using onboard thrusters. The success of this insertion not only signifies ISRO's capabilities in such complex orbital manoeuvres, but it gives confidence to handle future interplanetary missions,” ISRO said. Aditya-L1 will keep a close watch on the changing space weather, especially disruptions in the Sun.","India has successfully launched Aditya-L1, its first solar observatory, in a halo-shaped orbit around the Sun-Earth Lagrange Point 1, located 1.5 million km from Earth.

""Besides some upcoming performances, I am working on a couple of projects including continuing on 'Women on Record', a celebration of women in the gramophone era. Besides, my series on the rendition of Begum Akhtar's works will complete 10 years in 2023. I am doing a concert centered around that wherein will be weaved anecdotes of Akhtar's life. It will be about honouring her as an artist, and her life as well,"" she tells.

Known for bending genres and experimenting consistently, Shah says it is a driving force for her and adds value to her work. ""It introduces me to new research and the sheer richness of our culture. Besides, it is in the nature of our arts; especially music -- it is so rooted in anecdotes... there are so many stories, and they are extremely important to me. It brings me closer to the audience.""

Besides being the founder member of Paridhi Research – a rights-based women's organisation working on reproductive and sexual health with a focus on birth control methods, she was the Programme Coordinator with Naz Foundation (India) Trust. ""The social journey has been extremely fruitful. Music or any kind of art is so socially embedded even in folk narratives and I cannot see them in isolated silos.

The Arunachal Times ,10/1/0009,State needs juvenile courts,"The two-day workshop on Capacity Building Program for Journalists organized by Impulse NGO ended on Saturday. The programme focused on the human trafficking problem in northeast region and ways to report about them in the media.

On the second day, there was extensive discussion about the legal problem faced by the young criminals due to lack of juvenile court in Arunachal Pradesh. Sunil Mow, advocate with Itanagar branch of Guwahati High court dwelled on the urgent need to set up juvenile court in the state. “We have filed a PIL in this regard. There is immediate need to start juvenile justice system in our state as many offenders in the recent days have emerged to be under age children,” told Sunil Mow.

Hasina Kharbhih from Impulse NGO Network discussed about how journalists should approach while writing story on human trafficking. “It is important to make sure that journalists understand the emotion of a victim while conducting their interview. If a victim cries in between the conversation, don’t end the interview. Let that person go through their moment of emotion and then continue the rest of interview,” shared Ms Hasina.

She also highlighted safety concern, which journalists need to keep in mind while reporting on human trafficking issue. “Human trafficking is a dangerous crime and lots of syndicate criminals are involved. Those journalists working undercover or out in open must ensure their own safety,” told Ms Hasina.

The last day of programme saw active participations from the students of mass communication, Rajiv Gandhi University. These young budding journalists asked many questions to the attendees, which included prominent journalists of state and some NGO’s.

The two day workshop was organized by Impulse NGO in association with Arunachal Times (media partner), Athupopu Social Foundation (state partner) and sponsored by UNIFEM (United Nations Development Fund for Women).","The two-day workshop on Capacity Building Program for Journalists, organized by Impulse NGO, concluded with a focus on human trafficking in the northeast region and strategies for effective media reporting.

THE TRIBUNE,10/1/0114,"Jayalalithaa to remain in jail, bail hearing deferred to October 7"," Jailed AIADMK supremo Jayalalithaa will have to stay in prison for at least six more days as the Vacation Bench of the Karnataka High Court today posted for October 7 hearing on her pleas for suspension of the sentence and immediate bail in the disproportionate assets case.

As Jayalalithaa sought immediate relief, the court yesterday first posted the hearing for October 6 but hours later listed the matter for today after her counsels pleaded for urgent hearing.

When the matter came up before the Vacation Bench judge Justice Rathnakala, Jayalalithaa's counsel Ram Jethmalani pleaded for suspending the sentence pending appeal under Section 389 of the Criminal Procedure Code and for her release on bail.

Section 389 states that pending any appeal by a convicted person, the Appellate Court may order that the execution of the sentence or order appealed against be suspended. Also, if the person is in confinement, that he or she be released on bail, or on own bond.

During the brief hearing, Special Public Prosecutor Bhavani Singh filed the objections to Jayalalithaa's pleas and also a memo about his appointment as the SPP in the case.

Singh, who was SPP in the Special Court in the disproportionate assets case, had told the court yesterday that he had not yet received any official notification appointing him as the SPP for the criminal appeal filed in the High Court.

As Singh sought more time, the judge had first posted the matter for hearing on October 6, which was later rescheduled for today following pleas by Jayalalithaa's counsels.

Jayalalithaa's aide Sasikala, her relatives V.N. Sudhakaran, disowned son of the former Chief Minister and Ilavarasi will also have to spend at least six more days in jail as their petitions for bail and suspension of the sentence were also adjourned for October 7.

The High Court is on Dasehra holidays from September 29 to October 6. October 7 is also a government holiday on account of Bakrid.

In her petitions seeking immediate bail and challenging her sentence, Jayalalithaa has maintained that the charges of amassing wealth against her were false and that she had acquired property through legal means.

Jayalalitha has also contended that the trial court has overlooked several judgements and has not considered the binding nature of various income tax orders and decisions of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, which had accepted the income and the level of expenditure pleaded by her. — PTI","Jailed AIADMK leader Jayalalithaa's plea for suspension of sentence and immediate bail in the disproportionate assets case has been postponed by the Karnataka High Court's Vacation Bench to October 7.

The Arunachal Times ,10/1/0217,Migrant Menace,"The recent decision by the government to grant citizenship to many Chakma and Hajong refugees settled in Arunachal Pradesh ruffled many feathers in the state. The decision led to widespread opposition by all indigenous citizens of the state and a state bandh was declared to protest against the decision. Most Arunachali natives are aware and are very wary about the threat posed by refugees like Chakma, Hajong and Tibetans.
However, there is an emerging threat from another direction which does not get adequate attention. There is a clear and present danger posed to indigenous population by migrants from other regions of India. Many areas of north east are subject to this potent but concealed danger. Tripura is a typical example wherein the aboriginal tribal population has been reduced to a minority. The dominance of migrants has been such that the native tribal population are demanding a new state within Tripura.


Another example is Assam. Almost all major businesses of Assam are dominated by migrants. With Guwahati being the main wholesale centre of North East India, the migrant community controls the economy of the entire north east. Important cities like Guwahati, Dibrugarh, Tinsukia, Jorhat, etc are dominated by other non-native communities. Demographically and politically also, the dominance of migrants is such that amongst the 14 Lok Sabha MPs of Assam, only 4 are original Assamese.
As per latest census figures, almost 36 percent population of Arunachal Pradesh is non ST, i.e. migrants. Even in our state most businesses and shops are dominated by migrants. It may not be wrong to state that the economy of our state is also dominated by migrants. Most supplies to govt organisations are dominated by migrant suppliers based in Assam and other states. There is a huge economic outflow of Arunachali money to other states.
A few months back there was a major incident at Silapathar in Assam between natives and migrants. The incident led to violence and massive protests in Assam with allegations and counter allegations from both sides. This incident should be a major lesson for our statesince migrant communities based in border towns like Silapathar, Tinsukia, Dibrugarh, Lakhimpur, Tezpur etc indirectly control the economy of Arunachal Pradesh.
The dominance of migrants in the economy of north east is partly due to the reluctance and incapability of local natives in this field. Normally, natives are more interested in govt jobs and there is a stigma associated with getting into business and industries. Before more damage is done, urgent steps are required to curb this menacing threat of migrants.


Many constituencies of our state are already dominated by migrant voters. The day is not far when there would be an MLA or MP from the migrant population in Arunachal Pradesh. Our political leadership and citizens need to take notice of this clear and present danger.(The writer is a retired Group Captain of the Indian Air Force)","The government's decision to grant citizenship to Chakma and Hajong refugees in Arunachal Pradesh sparked protests, but the focus on indigenous threats overlooks the influx of migrants from other parts of India. Examples from Tripura and Assam highlight the economic and demographic dominance of migrants, with concerns over political representation and economic outflow. Incidents like the one in Silapathar underscore tensions between natives and migrants. Urgent measures are needed to address the growing influence of migrants in Arunachal Pradesh before it impacts political and economic dynamics further.",Politics,87,481

The Arunachal Times,10/19/0023,"Education dept refutes allegation, claims e-studio is a state of art facility","ITANAGAR, 18 Oct: The education department has claimed that the e-studio which is established at the directorate of school education, Itanagar is an excellent example of state of art in Arunachal Pradesh which can cater to the need of the virtual teaching-learning of the students. Therefore, it is neither parachuted nor ill-intended project, said Amjad Tak, commissioner education.

The statement came in response to an investigation published in this daily where it showed that e-learning studio and virtual classroom had failed despite expenditure of lakhs of rupees.

The e-studio is a good resource centre for the state to develop e-content to impart education at all levels in

Arunachal Pradesh and will set a good example of e-learning, he said.

Below is the full statement from the department.

In line with the Ministry of Education’s guidelines and the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, online education is a crucial component of the current educational policy in Arunachal Pradesh. The COVID-19 pandemic made physical classes unfeasible, necessitating the adoption of open-source digital learning solutions and e-learning management software, the statement read.

A location within the new block of the secondary education directorate building was identified for the e-learning project. Collaboration with IIT Madras and NPTEL, known for their expertise, was considered. Detailed project estimates were submitted by Krishnan Krishnamurty from IIT Madras after extensive discussions. However, the proposed Memorandum of Understanding had some issues and was under consideration with modifications.

IIT Madras sent experts to Arunachal Pradesh, highlighting the need for a resilient network for successful e-learning implementation.

Apart their proposals were not rejected by the govt. of Arunachal Pradesh and were kept for consideration with some modifications in the proposals.

It has wrongly been alleged that IIT, Madras had invested a lot in the project as because in this connection two persons from IIT, Madras (1 (one) faculty and 1 (one) vendor) had visited Arunachal Pradesh for its proper implementation at the Central e-Studio as well as receiving end Virtual Classrooms to be established in the various schools of Arunachal Pradesh.

An urgent requirement led to a Rs. 25 lakh sanction from the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund. Quotations were invited from various firms, and Shree Shyam Traders, Gandhi Chowk, Doomdooma, Assam, offered the lowest rate.

The IT department of Arunachal Pradesh vetted the selected firm’s technical specifications and compared them with IIT Madras’s proposals. The project, executed by the education department’s engineering wing, included civil works, furnishings, and equipment procurement. An estimated project cost of Rs. 800 lakh was partially sanctioned, with Rs. 160.85 lakh paid for execution.

The e-studio was utilized for recording Science and Maths classes during COVID-19 and broadcasted through various channels. Subsequently, the SCERT in Arunachal Pradesh used the e-studio for content development. A portion of the e-studio is now operated by ISSE as Vidya Samiksha Kendra, aligning with the ministry of education’s proposal. Proper functioning of the central e-studio awaits the establishment of internet connectivity through V-SAT or other means at the 100 higher secondary schools in Arunachal Pradesh.","The education department in Arunachal Pradesh defends the e-studio project, stating it is a state-of-the-art facility for virtual teaching and learning.

the hans india,10/19/0023,Winning juggernaut!,"Goingby the current form of the teams, the popular pre-match prediction of India's World Cup game against Bangladesh here on Thursday will be a romp for Rohit Sharma's men. But if the glossy surface is scratched, one will have to tear away that view based on the form book. Bangladesh have beaten India three times in the last four ODIs -- twice in a bilateral series in December 2022 and then in the Asia Cup Super Four match recently.

In this tournament, the underdogs have already shown how to slay the giants. If in doubt, check with England and South Africa about their feelings after their shock losses to Afghanistan and Netherlands respectively. India would certainly want to avoid that banana peel and keep their good run intact in this World Cup. In the batting front, captain Rohit will look to continue his imperious form while top order batters Shubman Gill and Virat Kohli will be eager to score big.

Among others, Shreyas Iyer's unbeaten fifty against Pakistan has signalled that India's batting is firing in unison and there are no real concerns.

No doubt, India will be firm favourites against Bangladesh, considering their bowlers' top class performances in restricting Australia for a mere 199 and Pakistan for a poor 191. Indian bowlers too have done a collective job though Jasprit Bumrah's brilliance and Kuldeep Yadav's guile made them a stand out attack from the rest in the competition, in their sheer ability to keep the opposition team's scoring rate in check and making regular inroads even on the flattest of decks. Bangladesh are not to be blamed if they spend a large part of their preparation time drawing up plans against Rohit, whose red-hot form promises a third century in a row in World Cup encounters against the 'Tigers'.

The Tribune,10/20/0004,9 Independent MLAs back Cong,"There appears to be no early end to the ongoing suspense as to who will be the next Maharashtra Chief Minister.

With both Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) citing numbers to claim the top job, the matter will now be taken up only after Dussehra. The talks were put on hold when neither side showed any signs of resiling from their respective positions.

Several formulae have been suggested but none have been found acceptable. There is one proposal that the chief ministership be rotated between the two parties. However, the sticking point here is as to who will head the government first. The Congress has said it will be willing to relinquish the post if Mr Sharad Pawar moves to the state. Mr Pawar has rejected this suggestion.

AICC sources also maintain that Mr Pawar is personally not averse to Mr Sushil Kumar Shinde’s continuance as the Chief Minister as he would not like to give the post to a Maratha, which he would be compelled to do if the post comes to the NCP. It is feared that the new incumbent could become a rival power centre. Mr Pawar, however, is learnt to be under pressure from his cadres who do not want him to give in to the Congress.

With both sides claiming the Chief Minister’s post on the basis of their respective numerical strength, the Congress continued to play the numbers game today in its effort to mount pressure on the NCP into conceding the post to them. Nine Independent legislators, who have agreed to support the Congress, were presented before party President Sonia Gandhi this evening. They were accompanied by Union Minister Prithviraj Chavan and Mr Kripa Shankar, Home Minister in the outgoing Maharashtra Government.

Formal talks will now be resumed after Union Defence Minister Pranab Mukherjee, the key Congress negotiator, returns from Puja celebrations in West Bengal on October 23. The Congress and the NCP are hoping that this three-day break will help evolve a consensus. As it is, the tussle between the two alliance partners has cast a shadow on the ruling combine’s victory.

NCP leaders stated as the single largest party, they had first claim on the Chief Minister’s post. There has been no change in their position, it was stated and this has conveyed to the Congress leaders. “The ball is now in the Congress court,” said a senior NCP leader.

AICC leaders, on the other hand, maintained that with the addition of these MLAs, the Congress has further gone up, making it the single largest party in the new Assembly. The Congress maintains it is the rightful claimant for the chief ministership as the electoral victory is an endorsement of the Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde’s government.","

Financial Express,10/20/0019,"UP Assembly bypolls crucial test for BJP, Congress state unit chiefs","The BJP’s Swatantra Dev Singh and the Congress’ Ajay Kumar Lallu are keen to hit a victory note as their party’s Uttar Pradesh unit chiefs in the by-polls to 11 Assembly seats on Monday to boost morale of their workers before the 2022 state elections. Of the 11 seats going to the by-polls, eight were held by the BJP and the Pratapgarh seat was held by its ally Apna Dal (Sonelal).

The BJP, BSP, SP and the Congress have fielded their candidates on all the seats. The saffron party is hoping to increase its tally in the Legislative Assembly by registering a win in Rampur, held by the Samajwadi Party, and in Jalalpur, held by the Bahujan Samaj Party. On the other hand, the opposition parties are expecting to repeat the success they tasted in the by-polls to Gorakhpur, Phulpur and Kairana Lok Sabha seats, and in Noorpur assembly constituency last year.The Congress, in particular, hopes to show signs of revival in UP after its battering in the Lok Sabha polls in when it won just one seat, party chief Sonia Gandhi’s Rae Bareli constituency. In contrast, the BJP won 62 of the 80 parliamentary seats in the state and an ally bagged two more. The BSP and the SP, which were in an alliance in the general elections, ended their tie-up after the polls. The BSP-SP combine won 15 seats.
In the 2017 assembly polls, the SP had a tie-up with the Congress. Campaigning for the by-polls saw Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath targeting the Congress on the issue of abrogation of Article 370 provisions. He also hit out the SP and BSP over corruption. Both Swatantra Dev Singh and Ajay Kumar Lallu exuded confidence that their parties will emerge victorious in the by-polls.

While Singh claimed that the by-polls will be “one-sided” for the BJP, Lallu said there are “indication of good results for the party”. Voting will be held days after the murder of Kamlesh Tiwari, a leader of a lesser-known political outfit Hindu Samaj Party in Lucknow, with the Congress latching onto it to highlight the “poor” law-and-order situation in the state. During the hustings, UP Congress spokesperson Ashok Singh attacked the BJP government over the killing of Tiwari, saying the incident highlighted the “poor law-and-order situation” in the state.

“The law and order situation in the state has deteriorated from bad to worse. The killing of Kamlesh Tiwari in the state capital drop clear hints that all is certainly not well as far as tackling crime in the state is concerned,” he had said.

However, Adityanath termed the murder “an act of mischief to create terror”, and said that such incidents will not be tolerated and those involved will not be spared. In total, 109 candidates are in the fray for the bypolls to the Assembly seats of Gangoh, Rampur, Iglas (SC), Lucknow Cantonment, Govindnagar, Manikpur, Pratapgarh, Zaidpur (SC), Jalalpur, Balha (SC) and Ghosi.

The by-polls were necessitated after some MLAs won the Lok Sabha elections and resigned as members of the state assembly. The assembly constituency of Ghosi became vacant following the resignation of sitting MLA Phagu Chauhan after he was appointed as the Governor of Bihar. The maximum number of candidates are 13 each in Lucknow Cantonment and Jalalpur assembly constituencies, followed by 11 each in Ghosi, Gangoh, Pratapgarh and Balha (SC).

Nine candidates each are in the fray in Govindnagar and Manikpur seats. Besides, seven candidates each will contest the by-polls from Rampur, Iglas (SC) and Zaidpur (SC) seats.

The Times of India,10/24/0006,China successfully launches two satellites,"BEIJING: China on Tuesday successfully launched two space environment exploration satellites, marking the 50th consecutive successful launch by the Communist giant since October 1996.
The two satellites were launched from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Centre in north China's Shanxi province with a Long March-4B carrier rocket.
One of the satellite was detached from the rocket after about 11 minutes of take-off, followed by the other about one minute later. Both have successfully entered preset orbits, Xinhua news agency reported.
The two satellites, which form Group-02 of Shijian-6, were manufactured by the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology and China's DFH Satellite Co, Ltd respectively. Both have a designed life of more than two years.


They will replace two Shijian-6 satellites launched on September 9, 2004, to conduct exploration of space environment, radiation in space and their influence, parameters of physical environment of the space, and carry out other related space experiments.
Tuesday's launch marked the 92nd flight of Long March series of carrier rockets and the 50th consecutive successful launch of such rockets since October 1996.


In 1981 China became the fourth country in the world to be able to launch more than one satellite at the same time with just one rocket.

The Mint,10/27/0017,John F. Kennedy files: Thousands released but Donald Trump holds back others,"Washington: President Donald Trump blocked the release of hundreds of records on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, bending to CIA and FBI appeals, while the National Archives came out on Thursday night with a hefty cache of others.

“I have no choice,"" Trump said in a memo, citing “potentially irreversible harm"" to national security if he were to allow all records to come out now. He placed those files under a six-month review while letting 2,800 others come out, racing a deadline to honour a law mandating their release.

The documents approved for release show federal agents madly chasing after tips, however thin, in the days after the 22 November 1963, assassination and juggling rumors and leads worldwide. The materials also cast a wide net over varied activities of the Kennedy administration, such as its covert efforts to upend Fidel Castro’s government in Cuba.

In a 14 September 1962, meeting disclosed in the files, for example, a group of Kennedy’s senior aides, including brother Robert, the attorney general, discussed a range of options against Castro’s communist government.

The meeting was told the CIA would look into the possibility of sabotaging airplane parts that were to be shipped to Cuba from Canada. McGeorge Bundy, JFK’s national security adviser, cautioned that sensitive ideas like sabotage would have to be considered in more detail on a case-by-case basis.

As for the unreleased documents, officials say Trump will impress upon federal agencies that “only in the rarest cases"" should JFK files stay secret after the six-month review.

Despite having months to prepare for disclosures that have been set on the calendar for 25 years, Trump’s decision came down to a last-minute debate with intelligence agencies — a tussle the president then prolonged by calling for still more review.","President Donald Trump has blocked the release of numerous records on the assassination of President John F.

The Free Press Journal,10/27/0022,Oldest Human DNA found in UK: Reveals human existence from the Ice Age,"The Ice Age is said to have begun approximately 2.4 million years ago and lasted until 11,500 years ago when the earth was covered in polar ice sheets and alpine glaciers. Over the years, remains of animals and distinct humans have been found. Recently, a research team in UK has found the oldest human DNA from the Ice Age.

It is touted to be about 27,000 years old, when Britain's two thirds of the Isles were covered by glaciers, which made them unsuitable for human habitation.

But as the climate changed, it became a home for new fertile soil. Now researchers and archaeologists are trying to figure out the stories of the ancient people who migrated during the ice age to find a region that became a veritable mix of civilisations.

The recent human genomes found are believed to be from either Britain orIreland,d as they point out two different origin stories dating back in the European mainland.


The remains found from Gough's Cave are more likely to have a link with the ancestors from Spain or Belgium. The other remains found from Kendrick's Cave show the link to Italy.

Both human genomes that were found tell us that they were alive about 13,500 years ago. That is just a few thousand years after the region was turned under the sheet of ice.
About the human remains found:

The remains from Gough's Cave are said to be the oldest of the two remnants found, and it is believed that they died around 15,000 years ago. It is also believed that the ancestors of these must have joined the migration movement from northwest Europe.


Remains found from Kendrick's Cave were said to be alive a few thousand years after that, and their ancestors probably migrated from near east Britan about 14,000 years ago.

The land of Britain and the Irish ice sheets virtually disappeared around 16,000 years ago, as the fossils found from that time are scarce, and the other remnants found are said to date back about 15,000 years ago, centuries before Britain's climate began to warm.


According to an archeologist, the 'Cheddar Man' fossils found date back to about 10,500 years ago, and these were the oldest remains found in England. 
The features of these humans were said to be bdark-skinneded with blue eyes, which clearly states that this population had yet to adapt to the colder climate.

The researchers are hoping to find a connection between the recent and the old remains. The newly discovered evidence suggests that Britain had different cultural as well as genetic characteristics. There are distinct difference between the diets of the two remains found. The Gough Cave shows signs of both animals and human bones, and a human skull was seen in a shard of a cup, possibly for cannibalistic purposes.

On the other hand, the remains from Kendrick's cave show the traces of eaten marine and freshwater fish and mammals.","Researchers in the UK have uncovered the oldest human DNA from the Ice Age, dating back approximately 27,000 years.

Both sets of human remains date back around 13,500 years, revealing insights into the populations that migrated to the region as the ice sheets receded. The findings contribute to understanding early human history in Britain.",Science and Technology,100,488
Goa Chronicle,10/27/0023,Urging for a probe into the role of Mamata in ration distribution scam: Suvendu,"Kolkata: Reacting to the arrest of West Bengal Forest Minister Jyotipriya Mallick, State Leader of Opposition Suvendu Adhikari on Friday demanded a probe into the role of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in the alleged ration distribution scam.

Taking to X, Adhikari said, ” I would urge the @dir_ed to probe the role of Mamata Banerjee in the huge WB Ration Distribution Scam. ”

” Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee didn’t appoint Jyotipriya Mallick as the Minister in Charge of the Food & Supplies Department; Govt of WB, in 2021 as she wanted to save him from the glare of Central Investigation Agencies after engaging in mountainous corruption for a decade as the Food & Supplies Minister from 2011 to 2021,” he commented.

“However, she wanted him to keep raising funds illegally and hand over the share of the proceeds to intended persons. So as a way out, she appointed him as the Chairman of the West Bengal Essential Commodities Supply Corporation (WBECSC), the company that is entrusted with the procurement & distribution of paddy & other food grains in WB, ” the BJP MLA from Nandigram added.

“She didn’t stop at this only. To ensure that siphoning of funds is done smoothly and efficiently, she appointed A.Subbiah; a retired IAS officer, as the MD of the West Bengal Essential Commodities Supply Corporation (WBECSC) to facilitate Jyotipriya Mallick. Who is A. Subbiah? ” he mentioned.

” He is a West Bengal-cadre officer of the 1992 batch. A case against Subbiah was filed by the Anti-Corruption Bureau, Chennai, in 2012 which was about allegedly receiving a bribe of Rs. 8 crore when he was the Chairman of V.O. Chidambaranar Port, formerly Tuticorin Port, ” Adhikari alleged.

” This officer had been charge-sheeted by the @CBIHeadquarters in Case No. RCMA1/ 2012/ A/ 0055 for masterminding a scam as the Acting Chairman of the Tuticorin Port Trust. Permission has also been granted for his prosecution. As a result, his promotion to the rank of Additional Chief Secretary was blocked and his pension (due after retirement) was withheld, ” he further alleged.

” Why is Mamata Banerjee responsible? She is the Minister-in-Charge of the Personnel and Administrative Reforms Department. It wouldn’t have been possible for A. Subbiah; a tainted & charge-sheeted retired officer, whose pension has been withheld and who is being prosecuted for corruption, to be appointed as Managing Director of WBECSC, if the CM didn’t want it personally, ” Adhikari asserted.

State BJP President Sukanta Majumdar commented, ” The Kingpin of the Ration Scam has finally been caught… The Truth will always prevail…”

ED arrested Mallick after grilling him since 6 AM on Thursday and finally took him to the CGO Complex around 0323 hrs.

Mallick, currently Bengal Forest Minister and former Food Minister, was arrested on charges of alleged irregularities in the distribution of statuary rations during the pandemic period.

Mallick accused the BJP and Adhikari of “orchestrating a deep conspiracy” for his arrest.

The ED arrested Mallick of non-cooperation in the process of Investigation.

The ED took Mallick to EDI Hospital at Joka for health check-up where a medical board has already been set up since the minister suffers from blood sugar, sources said.

The ED is expected to produce Mallick at the Bankshall Court in the city later on Friday and seek him in its custody.

The ED has appointed Special Prosecutor Firoz Edulji, who appeared during the arrest of State Commerce and former Education Minister Partha Chatterjee in the alleged cash-for-jobs scam last year.

Sources said besides, the raids were conducted simultaneously in two flats of Mallick at Salt Lake (Kolkata) areas, two other flats of Dey at Vivekananda Road ( Nager Bazar in Dum Dum) and another house of Dey at Bhagabati Park, also in Nager Bazar.

Raids were conducted in three other places too.

They said the ED, probing the money trails of the alleged irregularities in the statutory ration distribution system, has information that the arrested businessman, Bakibur Rahaman, has huge businesses in Bengal, Mumbai, and even Dubai worth near 100 crores of rupees.

Sources said Bakibur had rapport with Minister Mallick when he was the state food supplies minister in the previous Mamata Banerjee government. After the win in the 2021 assembly poll, Mallick was shifted to the Department of Forest Affairs and Non-Conventional and Renewable Energy Sources.

Mallick represents the Habra assembly segment in the North 24 Parganas.

A few months ago, the ED raided the residence of current food minister Rathin Ghosh, also in North 24 Parganas.","West Bengal Forest Minister Jyotipriya Mallick was arrested by the ED over alleged ration distribution irregularities during the pandemic.

Adhikari also accused Banerjee of appointing a tainted officer, A. Subbiah, to facilitate corruption. BJP President Sukanta Majumdar called Mallick the ""Kingpin of the Ration Scam.""

S N Bibhudutta,10/28/0012,Living Twice,"We grew up watching Bond. Hes grown up too. He still has a weakness for women and martinis but now fights for a cause and against his own demons.

The James Bond you like best is usually the one you grew up watching,or so goes the theory. It does not factor in two things. One is that a generation grew up watching two Bonds simultaneously,with a third adding brief variety. In the early 80s,when the video cassette created a craze that the DVD has never matched,every Bond film made till then came to us in a single glut. My friends and I grew up with Sean Connery,the first Bond,with George Lazenby,Connerys stand-in for one film,and with Roger Moore,the then current Bond. There goes any theory about fans always identifying with a single Bond.

The other factor is that the newest Bond appeals to older Bondophiles too,not just to those who are in the process of growing up with him. Because of the way he is,his appeal ought to stretch to the Pierce Brosnan generation,and even to the Timothy Dalton generation if you assume that two films are enough to create a generation. Skyfall,here we come,even though your Daniel Craig has destroyed much of what our beloved character used to be.

My,how the boy has grown! He has not totally given up womanising but is now capable of falling in love,something that last happened in 1969 (he married Tracy in On Her Majestys Secret Service but she died). There was a time when he wouldnt let anything ruffle him and would treat even death as a joke,but today he is disturbed,fighting his own demons. And he is no longer in the job for the fun of it but is carrying out his mission for reasons that his older fans will identify with,having grown up before he did.

Though he has finally caught up with us,not all of it works. What does and what doesnt is the stuff a debaters dreams are made of. It could go on forever,but lets stop at dividing the fors and the againsts into neat little threes.

The new Bond is obsessively hunting the killers who took his love in his first film and nearly got his boss,M,in his second. It is not just about revenge but also because he cannot get over the fact that Vesper Lynd died to protect him. Thats the first thing going for him. An obsessed,disturbed Bond connects nicely today,just as an arrogantly aloof one (Connery) and a patriotic one enjoying himself (Moore) did 30 years ago.

The new Bond is ruthless,true to the benchmark set for him 50 years ago. Connery,who shot an unarmed Professor Dent in cold blood in Dr No (1962),always rang true as the assassin but the next four Bonds were softer in varying degrees,though I still delight in the humour Moore brought to his killings. Craig,the adult Bond,does not kill without reason but his brutality sets him apart. Thats number two: hes convincing as someone with a licence to kill. See how he shoots down an unarmed man in an embassy and how he pushes a fellow British agent off a balcony.

And see how sensitive he has become. Distressed at having been the cause of an innocent girls murder,he tells M to mention in her report that Strawberry Fields showed true bravery. If you have been watching Bond as long as I have,you will know the sequence this one derives from. It was in Goldfinger,44 years earlier,with Jill Masterson killed in almost identical fashion,getting gold paint where Miss Fields gets oil. Far from mentioning bravery when M ticked him off,Bond stepped out and started flirting with Miss Moneypenny. To teens of the 80s,it was cool unflappability. To adult fans of today,it would have been cold insensitivity if he did that again.

A Bond who has been so accommodating of the demands of a generation his predecessors hooked,too,deserves our sensitivity. The three things that go against him we will present simply as the three things he needs to do. All are simply old habits he needs to rediscover.

First,we need him as the incurable womaniser once again. Falling in love a second time might have worked in the old westerns,but in Bond it would destroy one of the defining Bond qualities that we still hold dear. The Bond girl,of course,is supposed to have become different today after Brosnan reinvented so many things around him (equality of the sexes,post-Cold War relevance) without reinventing Bond himself. I would like to see the new Bond still go after her,on her terms if necessary,as long as he takes things to their logical conclusion.

He will need the one-liners for that,which is number two on the to-do list. Dalton,the office boy-cum-action man without a sense of humour,restricted the use of the one-liner. Brosnan brought it back but didnt know when to use it. A running helicopter tied by a rope to Xenia Onatopp has just suffocated her against a tree in GoldenEye and he has to say,She always did enjoy a good squeeze. How sick to an adult ear. We loved it as teens,though,when Connery drove a spear through an assassins heart in Thunderball and guessed,I think he got the point. And when Moore pushed Locque and his car off a cliff in For Your Eyes Only and observed,He never had a head for heights. Since the new Bond never jokes about death,and since we no longer want him to,he can restrict the one-liner to his conversations with the Bond girls.

That would include Miss Moneypenny,which is actually the only thing left for him to do. To be able to flirt with her,though,hell need help from his creators. Q,one hears,is coming back in Skyfall. Bring back Moneypenny too. And we’ll have the perfect Bond.

SEAN CONNERY

A ruthless killer with a sense of humour and a way with women. Arrogant and aloof,created the impression that he took no one seriously but himself. Six films as the official Bond,one as a rebel.

GEORGE LAZENBY

Stood in for one film after Connery opted out. Would have been forgotten but for the fact that he was the only Bond who married the girl he loved. She was still in her wedding gown when she was killed.

ROGER MOORE

Seven films make him the longest-serving official Bond. He brought in extra humour,often directed at himself,glorified the one-liner,and came across as a Bond who could be unscrupulous.

TIMOTHY DALTON

Two films and gone. A studious type who created the impression he was doing it all for patriotism. Restricted the one-liners but was involved in a couple of hallmark Bond action scenes.

PIERCE BROSNAN

A Bond who came with a plot tailored to make him relevant again after the Cold War. First Bond to report to a female boss,he now allows Bond girls to treat him on their terms.

DANIEL CRAIG

Deeply disturbed Bond,obsessed with personal yet adult agendas that drive him. Matches Connery for ruthlessness but the humour is gone. Begins at Bond’s roots,with one story leading to another,so far.

Three films that had James Bond but were not part of the official franchise

Casino Royale 1954

The first Bond actually came eight years before Sean Connery,one of the littler known factoids about 007. Barry Nelson,now forgotten in history,played an American version of the spy in an hour-long episode of a television series. Its not an easy film to find but IMDb informs us that Bond works for the CIA,or Combined Intelligence Agency.

Casino Royale 1967

This was meant to spoof the first of the official Bond films,Dr No. Its novelty lay in the number of actors who played the Bond character. Among them were the distinguished Alec Guinness and Woody Allen,who was an American version,Jimmy Bond. Ursula Andress,the first Bond girl,appeared here as Bond as well as Vesper Lynd.

Never Say Never Again 1983

Often mistaken for an official Bond film because it had Sean Connery as the secret agent. It was actually a rebel film,a statement by Connery who was still angry at having been replaced 10 years earlier. It came out of Hollywood while all the official Bond films are British productions. It is essentially a remake of Connerys Thunderball.

Let Girls be Girls

Hasnt the Bond girl become a woman? What nonsense,says Kabir Firaque

They werent called Bond girls when they were without question Bond girls. Even if someone did call them that,he didnt have the internet to spread the word. The expression seems to have come into circulation during the Pierce Brosnan era,and it sounded just right to describe those lovely people we had known so long. Ironically,the same era also sought to reinvent the image of the Bond girl. And now there is talk that maybe its time to reinvent her name too. Even the newest Bond girls seem to think so. Hasnt the Bond girl become relevant enough to be called a Bond woman? Hasnt she ceased to be eye candy and become a multidimensional character? Have you ever heard such nonsense?

She may have evolved along with Bond,but even in her evolution,she has retained much of the juvenile qualities we loved about her and acquired a few adult ones that she didnt have already. A short checklist:

THE NAMES

Honey Ryder,of course,began it all. She would be outmatched two films later by Pussy Galore. No Bond girl has managed to top that name in 50 years. Sean Connerys other girls included Kissy Suzuki,Tiffany Case and Plenty OToole. Roger Moore had Mary Goodnight,Dr Holly Goodhead and Chew Mee. Brosnan,supposedly the re-inventor,couldnt get rid of Xenia Onatopp,Dr Christmas Jones or Dr Molly Warmflash. Daniel Craig too has been looking for names,though the girls havent made it easy for him. Vesper Lynd rejects the alias he offers her: Stephanie Broadchest. It was the other girl who did have a name,though she tried to hide it. She insisted on being called only Miss Fields and died without revealing her secret. But these days we have the internet and IMDb lays it bare: Strawberry Fields. Now thats what I call a Bond girl.

THE CHARMS

Its one of those old-world values that shes upheld,whether you call her a Bond girl or a Bond woman. She may have as many dimensions as you want to give her,but she retains what it takes to be eye candy.

THE GAMES

The old Bond girl would drop the cue for a Bond one-liner,usually a double entendre:

Old Bond (Connery): Werent you a blonde when I came in?

Tiffany Case: Could be.

Bond: I tend to notice little things like that &#8213; whether a girl is a blonde or a brunette.

Miss Case: Which do you prefer?

James Bond: Well,as long as the collar and cuffs match

You may change the rules of the game,but they will still play. The new Bond girl will often be the one to have the last word,and a sarcastic one at that:

Vesper Lynd: So as charming as you are,Mr Bond,I will be keeping my eye on our governments money and off your perfectly formed a**.

New Bond: You noticed?

Miss Lynd: Even accountants have imagination.

Does being so sure of herself make her a Bond woman? If you search your memory hard enough,truth will prevail:

Old Bond (Moore): My name is Bond. James Bond. Im looking for Dr Goodhead.

Holly Goodhead: You just found her.

Bond: A woman!

Dr Goodhead: Your powers of observation do you credit,Mr Bond.

No less sarcastic,and she had the last word here too. If Dr Goodhead was a Bond girl,it makes Miss Lynd one too,no?

THE CHARACTERS

Making Bonds boss a woman is a wonderful touch,but M is not among those facing an identity crisis. Innocent office girl Miss Fields is murdered because she was with Bond,as was Goldfingers girlfriend Jill Masterson four decades earlier. Miss Lynd,an accountant,captured the new Bonds heart,but Tracy Draco,a countess,had actually married an old Bond. Former spy Camille Montes is driven by a thirst for revenge for her parents murder,but student Melina Havelock had been there,done that in 1981. What new multiple dimensions are they talking about?

What has changed is Bond,and therefore the way he and the girls deal with each other. Dints bottom was there to be slapped by the sexist Bond of the 60s. Solitaire was convinced by the unscrupulous Bond of the 70s,who doctored her tarot cards,that her destiny was to sleep with him  a fit case for rape today. Miss Lynd sizes up the new Bond the moment she sees him. And Miss Moneypenny,who suffered for decades the unfulfilled promises of the old Bonds

flirtations,showed the newer Brosnan his place and still exchanged double entendres with him.

Let them evolve for Bond if they must,but let them remain Bond girls for us. They deserve better than to be called names.","The article reflects on the evolution of James Bond over the years, particularly focusing on Daniel Craig's portrayal in ""Skyfall."" It discusses Bond's transformation into a more disturbed and emotionally complex character, still retaining his ruthlessness. The author acknowledges the challenges faced by the latest Bond and points out three aspects that need attention: embracing his womanizing tendencies, bringing back the one-liners, and reintroducing the character Miss Moneypenny. The piece also delves into the history of Bond actors and unofficial Bond films.",Entertainment,82,2135
Times of India,10/3/0202,Durga Puja celebrations go low-key amid the pandemic,"From offering pushpanjali to Ma Durga, to gorging on delicious bhog while pandal hopping, there is a lot to do during Durga Puja every year However, not this year.
With the COVID-19 outbreak, Pune’s Durga Puja associations have decided to go for a small scale, intimate and virtual celebration.
No big idols this year
While artisans are called to sculpt the big idols of the goddess every year, this year most pandals are going for the ghot pujo (Kalash puja). Some old committees may host smaller idols. Khadki Kali Bari will be getting a 12-inch high eco-friendly Durga idol, along with a slightly bigger fibre idol that they intend to use for following years too. “But this year the rituals will be done with a smaller idol of the goddess and the immersion will also happen in a tank,” says Anup Dutta, general secretary, Khadki Kali Bari.

Pune’s oldest Durga Puja, Bangiya Sanskriti Samsad, that organises Durga puja in Congress Bhavan is shifting their intimate celebration to a club house in Bhosle Nagar. “Since we don’t have an idol this year, we don’t require the big space of Congress Bhavan. We will have ghot pujo for all three days and only limited members will be allowed. For the senior members and visitors, the entire process will be streamed online,” says Sujata Paul, president, Bangiya Sanskriti Samsad, Bhosle Nagar.
Live streaming of rituals

Since everything in the last few months has gone virtual, Durga puja, too, will be turning to online platforms for darshan and aarti. “The priest will be doing a virtual ghot puja at his residence in Kolkata and that will be live streamed for all the members. Pushapanjali will be offered virtually as well. We cannot take the risk of physically doing the puja,” says Sandeep Munshi, vice president, Paschim Pune Bangiya Parishad, Baner.

Oikyotan Bangiya Parishad Durga Puja, Pimple Saudagar, has prepared a special technical team that will be live streaming everything on various virtual platforms. “Our committee has over 400 families and we don’t want anyone to miss Durga Puja. Hence, will be streaming each and everything on Zoom for members, and via Facebook live for non-members,” says Biswajit Saha, secretary, Oikyotan Bangiya Parishad Durga Puja.

Helping folk artistes and associates

Sandeep and his committee have also decided to financially help all the vendors who have been associated with them for years. “From the cooks and dhakis, to flower vendors and priests, we will be donating an amount between Rs 5000-Rs 15000 to these people who have been associated with us since long. If more people donate, we will increase the amount,” shares Sandeep.
While Sandeep’ committee is extending financial help, Khadki Kali Bari will be donating food grains. To folk artistes, dhakis etc. On similar lines, Congress Bhavan too, will be helping the artistes, local vendors and priests by raising funds for their survival.
Bhog will be home delivered

This year eating bhog in a puja pandal with friends and families will be truly missed. But associations have come up with the idea of getting bhog delivered to your door steps. “We have collaborated with caterers here and we are planning to get bhog delivered at your door step at a nominal price. We are also planning to get the daily prasad delivered to our members.,” says Biswajit.

Khadki Kaali baari is also planning something along similar lines. “We will be taking orders in advance and based on that we will create packages. Will it be home delivered or picked up by self, is something we haven’t decided yet. But it will surely not be served at the venue,” says Anup.

Virtual performances

The five days of Durga puja is filled with a lot of entertainment. Various artistes from Bengal come here and perform, some of the committees also get prominent artistes to perform, but this year all of this is going virtual. Khadki Kaali Baari is holding a digital contest called the Voice of Pune. “It is a singing competition, which will be judged by prominent singer. The hunt has already begun, so let’s see who will win it,” says Anup.


On the other hand, Biswajit says that his committee has already started virtual events in order to cheer up all the members. “The times are really difficult and now that puja is not happening on a large scale, people are disheartened, so we thought this could be a good way to lift their mood. So, we have started various digital events of dance, music and drama, and the same will happen during all five days of Durga puja as well,” says Biswajit

The Telegraph,11/10/0215,Swraj's son plunges to death in UK,"Angad Paul, the youngest son of Caparo chairman and peer Swraj Paul, plunged to his death from the family's eight- storey apartment block in London yesterday.

Angad, 45, who was chief executive officer of Caparo and one of Britain's most dynamic young business leaders, leaves behind wife Michelle and two young children. Sixteen companies from the Caparo group in the UK had recently been taken into administration.

Under the arrangement, an administrator â€” in this case PricewaterhouseCoopers ( PwC) â€” will manage the companies, protect them from creditors and possibly try to find a buyer able to carry on with the business. The step is not as bad as "" liquidation"" â€” when a company's assets are torn off and sold.

Caparo's 2014 turnover had dipped 1.3 per cent to Â£ 368 million and the group ended with an operating loss of Â£ 700,000.

Its UK operations suffered a Â£ 2.5- million operating loss in the year, reversing the Â£ 1.7- million profit made the previous year.

Angad's sudden death has devastated his family and friends. Many will see it as Britain's steel industry, beset by the dumping of cheap Chinese imports, claiming yet another victim.

One tweet expressed condolences for the family and then summed up: "" The other tragedy behind this is of course that of the steel industry, not just that of the employees but our capacity.... remind me, where are we buying the cheap steel from?"" But cheap Chinese steel is not the only problem. In any case, introducing import control is anathema to the British government. The Caparo group makes steel, automotive and engineering products, which have become increasingly hard to export to Europe as the pound sterling has strengthened against the euro.

Some 450 redundancies were announced last month at Caparo in what trade unions described as a "" devastating"" blow to the British steel industry, while the future of another 1,200 jobs is uncertain.

It will be up to the coroner formally to reveal the cause of Angad's death but the initial statement from London police said officers had been called to an address in Marylebone in central London at 11am yesterday.

"" London ambulance service and London's air ambulance both attended and the man, believed to be in his mid- 40s, was pronounced dead at the scene,"" it said. "" Enquiries into the circumstances of the incident continue but it is being treated as non- suspicious at this stage."" The apartment where chief minister Mamata Banerjee had called on Swraj in July is located in the same block.

Angad's father- in- law, Jeffery Bonn, said the family had been torn apart by the news of the death.

The 72- year- old, who lives in Kensal Rise, north London, told the London Evening Standard : "" We are all in pieces. We are very much in shock; nothing can be said. He was a very good, very generous and very kind man. He was dearly loved and will be so sadly missed."" Angad was born in London on June 6, 1970, and was educated, like his elder twin brothers Ambar and Akash, at Jawaharlal Nehru's and Winston Churchill's old school, Harrow.

He then attended Swraj's alma mater, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in Boston where he received a BSc in economics. But he also studied media arts and sciences, an interest he pursued successfully as producer and executive producer of several films, including the immensely successful Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch . He was also behind the Caparo T1, which was the world's fastest supercar when it was launched in 2006. It was developed by former McLaren Formula One engineers.","Angad Paul, the CEO of Caparo, died after falling from his eight-storey London apartment. Caparo Group, which operates in the UK, India, North America, and the United Arab Emirates, has faced financial troubles recently. It recently announced that its UK operations would be subjected to administration. The company had seen a dip in its 2014 turnover and had an operating loss of £700,000. The UK steel industry, where Caparo has significant operations, has been grappling with challenges such as cheap Chinese imports and a strengthening pound against the euro. Last month, 450 redundancies were announced at Caparo.",National News,97,610
hindusthan times,11/11/0019,Every concert in India has been absolutely crazy: Dimitri Thivaios,"Belgian DJs Dimitri Vegas and Like Mike (whose actual names are

interview with Bangalore Times. Excerpts:
You have performed in India before. What draws you to this

We have had a long connection with India. The first time we
played here was more than 10 years ago. We had started off by
playing at small VIP clubs, and now we doing one of the biggest
electronic music tours ever done in India. It’s an amazing
evolution for us.
You have performed in quite a few cities in the country. Do you have a favourite? To be honest, the energy is
surprisingly high everywhere we go. We’ve never done a concert in India that has not been absolutely crazy. So, it
is hard to pick a favourite.
Have you tried Indian cuisine or done anything touristy during your visits? We both love Indian food. So, we
eat it all the year round and not just when we visit India. I love Rogan Josh. I also love the spicier ones like the
Madras Curry and Vindaloo. However, that spice can be risky, so I stick to Rogan Josh. We have done very little

Your love for Salman Khan is well-known. How did that camaraderie happen?
I met Salman Khan during one of our very first tours to India, and we have always stayed in touch with him. We
love him. He is an amazing guy. He has been great to us and supports us in everything we do.
In a recent interview, you said you would love to collaborate with Indian artistes. Any projects that we can
expect in the near future?
We have worked with Pritam. In the future, I would also love to be part of a Bollywood movie and make music for
it. The Bollywood culture of having movie-related songs is an amazing synergy between music and films. I love it.
Crowd Control is one of your most iconic tracks. Did you anticipate the scale of popularity it reached when
you came up with it?
Yes and no. The track is based on something that we used to do in our live shows. One day, we decided to fit it
into a track. So, in that sense, we did know it works. What we did not expect is that it would be picked up by every
DJ in the world.

Hindustan Times,11/13/0200,"Relief for home owners, hiring push in Stimulus 3","New Delhi : In relief to home buyers, the government on Thursday doubled the tax exemption limit on price differential between the circle rate and the agreement value to 20%, a key component of the new ₹2.65 lakh crore economic stimulus package that also includes easy working capital to loans to 26 sectors hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, and incentives to companies to hire more people.

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced 12 measures under the third tranche of the government’s efforts to boost the economy, Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (self-reliant India initiative) 3.0. This includes the ₹1.46 lakh crore production-linked incentive (PLI) for 10 sectors that was announced on Wednesday.

Sitharaman said that including the ₹2,65,080 crore package announced Thursday, the quantum of total stimulus announced by India is ₹29,87,641 crore, including the monetary measures taken by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) – or around 15% of the gross domestic product (GDP). Minus the RBI’s monetary measures, the size of the stimulus is 9% of the GDP, she added.

The finance minister also pointed to recent indicators on the economy’s revival, including the composite Purchase Managers Index that came in at 58.9 in October, and credit carting firm Moody’s assessment that the Indian economy would shrink by 8.9% in calendar year 2020, better than its previous estimate of a 9.6% decline. To be sure, the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) Nowcast report projected that the Indian economy could have contract 8.6% in the next three months ended September.

Among the announcements on Thursday, the one on employment generation involves the government paying out both the employee and employer contributions of employees hired on or after October 1, 2020, for a period of two years under certain conditions (the monthly salary should be less than ₹15,000 and the company should have up to 1,000 employees). For companies with more than 1,000 employees, the government will pay out the employee contribution only. The scheme, Aatmanirbhar Bharat Rozgar Yojana, is aimed at incentivising job creation.

Speaking about the income-tax (I-T) relief to home buyers and developers, Sitharaman said: “There are quite a lot of [unsold] inventories we are told in the real estate sector... at the moment what is prevailing is the differential between the circle rate and the agreement value... you get relief. Now, what we have decided is to increase the differential between from 10% to 20% for the period from the date of this announcement to 30 June 2021 for only primary sale... and the necessary amendment in the I-T Act will be done in the due course.”

The finance minister said the decision on the price differential for homes will help to clear unsold inventories.

Naveen Wadhwa, DGM at Taxmann, said a 5% limit was first introduced in the 2018 budget, which was subsequently increased to 10% by the Finance Act, 2020. “This limit has now been increased to 20% for only primary sale of residential units of value up to ₹2 crore. This will bring relief for developers who have sold residential units at less than stamp duty value. However, it will not provide any relief in case of sale of commercial property or to the re-sellers of the residential units.”

Niranjan Hiranandani, national president of the National Real Estate Development Council (Naredco) said, “Although it is a significant relief to the sector, the cap of ₹2 crore will exclude many projects in metros. And commercial properties should have been included in its ambit.”

The finance minister said this is a major relief for the middle class “which wants to buy when the housing sector is going through a supply side boom... but had no incentive to buy. Now we provide incentives in the form of income-tax relief.”

Speaking about the second version of the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS 2.0) Sitharaman said, “We are launching credit guarantee support to all the stressed sectors. This [is] part of what was recognised by the Kamath Committee, which looked at various sectors which are stressed as a result of pandemic.”

Although, the details of 26 sectors were not immediately announced, the stressed sectors identified by the committee include construction, real estate, cement, power, steel, roads, logistics, shipping, retail, textile, consumer durables, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, gems and jewellery, auto component, mining, hospitality, tourism and aviation. “A formal notification to name the 26 sectors will be issued soon,” a finance ministry official said requesting anonymity.

The scheme will provide additional loan up to 20% of the outstanding credit with a tenor of five years, including one year moratorium on principal repayment. This scheme will be available till March 31, 2021, Sitharaman added.

ECLGS is one of the key components of the ₹20 lakh crore economic stimulus package under the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan launched in mid-May, which offered additional working capital finance of 20% of the outstanding credit as of February 29, in the form of a term loan to MSMEs and professionals. The scheme offers an easy additional working capital loan at a concessional rate of interest to an existing borrower who is not a defaulter.

The government has been taking various measures to boost an economy battered by the pandemic and a 68-day hard lockdown through April and May to check the spread of deadly Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. The Indian economy saw a record 23.9% contraction in the first quarter of the current financial year.

Between March 26 and May 17, the government unveiled the first stimulus-cum-relief measures worth ₹20.97 lakh crore. On October 12, she announced a second package of ₹73,000 crore, focusing on stimulating demand. The finance minister said measures announced on Thursday are in continuation with the two stimulus packages already announced and targeted to create more job opportunities.

The third stimulus package provides for an additional outlay of ₹10,000 crore to boost rural employment under the PM Garib Kalyan Rozgar Yojana, ₹18,000 crore additional outlay for urban housing under the PM Awaas Yojana (PMAY), ₹65,000 crore fertilizer subsidy to provide the input to farmers in the upcoming crop season and ₹3,000 crore to boost project exports through EXIM Bank.

In order to provide boost to infrastructure financing, the government also announced ₹6,000 crore equity investment in debt platform of National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF). This will help NIIF to provide a debt of ₹1.1 lakh crore for infrastructure projects by 2025, the finance minister said.

She said that the package also includes ₹10,200 crore additional budget stimulus for capital and industrial expenditure on domestic defence equipment, industrial infrastructure and green energy. The other component of the package is ₹900 crore fund to the Department of Biotechnology for research and development of an Indian Covid vaccine, she said.

Uday Kotak, president, Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) thanked the government for extending ECLGS for the 26 stressed sectors identified by the Kamath committee and the health care sector.

“This will help the sectors, which employ a large number of people, tide over the cash crunch and working capital issues, in the wake of low demand,” he said.

“Designed on the lines of a similar scheme existing for the MSMEs, ECLGS 2.0 will provide 100% guaranteed collateral free additional credit, thus helping provide interim liquidity support to these sectors, till demand recovers,” he added.","The Indian government has announced a ₹2.65 lakh crore economic stimulus package as part of the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan 3.0. Key measures include doubling the tax exemption limit for home buyers from 10% to 20% and providing ₹1.46 lakh crore in production-linked incentives for 10 sectors. The package also features the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Rozgar Yojana, which subsidizes employer and employee contributions for new hires, and the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS 2.0) offering additional loans to 26 stressed sectors. The total stimulus, including RBI measures, is around 15% of India’s GDP.",Business and Finance,92,1205

deccanchronicle ,11/18/1022,"Pelosi to step down from House leadership, stay in Congress","Pelosi announced she will step aside after leading Democrats for nearly 20 years and in the aftermath of the attack on her husband, PaulWashington: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday that she will not seek a leadership position in the new Congress, ending a historic run as the first woman with the gavel and making way for a new generation to steer the party after Democrats lost control of the House to Republicans in the midterm elections. In a spirited speech on the House floor, Pelosi announced that she will step aside after leading Democrats for nearly 20 years and in the aftermath of the brutal attack on her husband, Paul, last month in their San Francisco home -- and after having done “the people's work”.

The California Democrat, a pivotal figure in US history and perhaps the most powerful speaker in modern times, said she would remain in Congress as the representative from San Francisco, a position she has held for 35 years, when the new Congress convenes in January. “I will not seek re-election to Democratic leadership in the next Congress,” she said. “For me, the hour has come for a new generation to lead the Democratic caucus that I so deeply respect.”

Now, she said, “we must move boldly into the future”. Dressed in white in a nod to the suffragettes, Pelosi was greeted with cheers as she arrived for the hastily called address. She received a standing ovation when she closed, lawmakers and guests one by one crowding her with hugs, many taking selfies of a moment in history. President Joe Biden, who had encouraged Pelosi to stay on as Democratic leader, spoke with Pelosi in the morning and congratulated her on her historic tenure as speaker of the House.

“History will note she is the most consequential Speaker of the House of Representatives in our history,” Biden said in a statement, noting her ability to win unity from her caucus and her “absolute dignity”. It is an unusual choice for a party leader to stay on after withdrawing from congressional leadership, but not without precedent and Pelosi has long defied convention in pursuing power in Washington.

In an interview with reporters after her announcement, Pelosi said she will not endorse anyone in the race to succeed her and she will not sit on any committees as a rank-and-file lawmaker. She said the attack on her husband “made me think again about staying”. But in the end, after the election, she decided to step down. “I quite frankly, personally, have been ready to leave for a while,” she said. “Because there are things I want to do. I like to dance, I like to sing. There is a life out there, right?” During her remarks on the House floor, Pelosi recapped her career, from seeing the Capitol the first time as a young girl with her father -- a former New Deal congressman and mayor -- to serving as speaker alongside US presidents, noting three of the four, but not mentioning Donald Trump. “Every day I am in awe of the majestic miracle that is American democracy,” she said. At one point, she compared the better-than-expected showing for Democrats in the midterms, the first national election after the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, as “proof through the night that our flag was still there”, drawing cheers from colleagues. The American historian Jon Meacham helped Pelosi with her speech, but an aide said she added that impromptu line herself. On short notice, lawmakers who have been waiting and wondering about the long-serving leader's plans filled the House, at least on the Democratic side, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer joined. He later joined a throng of lawmakers and hugged and kissed Pelosi on the cheek. The Speaker's Gallery was filled with Pelosi's staff and guests. Some Republicans, including some newly-elected members, also attended, though House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, who is seeking the speakership in the new Congress, did not, telling reporters afterward that he was “busy, unfortunately”. Pelosi was twice elected to the speakership and has led Democrats through consequential moments, including passage of the Affordable Care Act with President Barack Obama and the impeachments of President Donald Trump. Her decision on Thursday paves the way for House Democratic leadership elections next month when Democrats reorganise as the minority party for the new Congress. Pelosi's leadership team, with Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Democratic Whip James Clyburn of South Carolina, has long moved as a triumvirate. All now in their 80s, the three House Democratic leaders have faced restless colleagues eager for them to step aside and allow a new generation to take charge. Hoyer said after Pelosi's remarks that “it is the time for a new generation of leaders” and that he will also step down from leadership but stay in Congress. Clyburn, the highest-ranking Black American in Congress, has said he expects to stay in Congress next year and hopes to remain at the leadership table.

","House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced she will not seek a leadership position in the new Congress, marking the end of her nearly 20-year tenure and historic role as the first woman to hold the gavel. In a speech following the midterm elections, Pelosi cited the need for new leadership after Democrats lost control of the House. Despite stepping down, she will continue to serve as the representative from San Francisco. Reflecting on her career, Pelosi emphasized the importance of American democracy and stated that the recent attack on her husband influenced her decision to leave leadership.",International News,96,837
Hindustan Times,11/20/0020,Min temperature dips to 9.4 degrees,"New Delhi : The minimum temperature in the national Capital dropped below 10 degrees Celsius for the first time this season, falling to 9.4°C on Thursday, three notches below the normal for this time of the year and an unusual occurrence for this time of the year, weather scientists said.

“Normally, minimum temperatures don’t drop under 10 degree C in November. In recent years, in 2017, during the last week of November, the minimum temperature had dipped to 7.6 degree C. It’s unusual for minimum temperatures to drop to single digit in mid November. Winter is setting in early this year,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.

In 2019 the lowest November temperature was 11.4 degree C and in 2018 it was 10.5 degree C.

The maximum temperature on Thursday stood at 25.6°C, two degrees below normal.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) had on Monday forecast that minimum temperatures would fall under the 10°C mark this week because of cold winds blowing in from the direction of the snow-clad western Himalayas. The weather forecaster also expects mercury levels to dip further from Sunday. “We are seeing a dip in minimum temperatures across northwest India and expect temperatures to dip further from November 22, when a western disturbance is likely to affect the western Himalayan region,” Srivastava added. ","Delhi experienced an unusually early winter chill as temperatures dipped to 9.4°C on November 19, marking the first sub-10°C reading of the season. This is three degrees below the typical minimum for mid-November. Weather officials say it’s uncommon for temperatures to drop this low so early, indicating an early onset of winter. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) had predicted this change due to cold winds from the western Himalayas. More cold is expected in the coming days as a western disturbance approaches. Comparatively, previous years saw higher minimums in November, highlighting the significance of this drop.",Entertainment,96,219

Gold is near to its resistance zone of $2000-2010 and the upside momentum is drifting sideways because of lack of fresh triggers. However gold is expected to remain positive on back of various combinations of factors. One of them is being expectations that the Federal Reserve might have concluded raising interest rates.

Third, a report by the World Gold Council revealed intensified buying by central banks around the world resulting in a new record for purchases in the first nine months of the year.

The Times of India,11/29/0214,Govt claims victory at WTO,"NEW DELHI: The government on Friday claimed victory at the World Trade Organization after members agreed to grant full immunity to developing countries against a possible breach of subsidy ceilings.
“…we have been able to secure an outcome that addresses our concerns… We have accomplished this without any concessions, compromise or new conditions,” commerce and industry minister Nirmala Sitharaman told Parliament. Stating that the “new and unambiguous” decision endorsed by the WTO membership will remain in perpetuity till a solution is found, she said it will also give flexibility to countries such as India in continuing their minimum support price policy.
Last year, in Bali, WTO members, including India, had agreed to finalize a new formula for calculating domestic support by 2017 and said any breach of the permissible 10% ceiling will not be challenged at the multilateral body during this period. In return, they agreed to sign the trade facilitation agreement (TFA) to usher in easier customs rules.

But after taking charge, the BJP government refused to sign TFA, arguing that it wanted a permanent solution. It, however, agreed to sign it after the US and others offered additional comfort by extending the four-year peace clause to perpetuity.

“This would do away with any ambiguity on this aspect as well as guard against the possibility of no cover being available after 2017 in case a permanent solution on public stockholding for food security purposes is not arrived at by then,” the minister said.

At the same time, WTO members have agreed to work out a permanent solution by December 2015. While there are fears that India will be asked to undertake additional commitments, Sitharaman suggested that this may not be the case.","The government of India claimed victory at the World Trade Organization (WTO) as members agreed to grant full immunity to developing countries against a possible breach of subsidy ceilings.

The Pioneer,11/30/0019,Sena’s quiet warrior,"Thackeray may not be as flamboyant as his father and Shiv Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray but was hand-held by him in lessons of fearlessness. Stories abound of how Thackeray senior, a fan of herpetology, introduced him to a world of snakes and reptiles. Politics is nothing but a snake pit and Uddhav, therefore, comes suitably prepared for the slithery swamp that the new Maharashtra alliance he is leading with the Nationalist Party Congress (NCP) and the Congress could become. The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi is a melange of ideologies. Ideologies that have made it through the elections by positing themselves against each other. But Uddhav has survived every time, wriggling around problems and biting, too, at rivals when needed. But with a studied, reasoned crawl rather than a race. Post Balasaheb, he has quietly helmed the Sena, which was preyed on by an aggressive BJP eager to expand its footprint. And then compromised by his cousin, the charismatic Raj, who people believe is more like Thackeray senior, but had to be content with a rebellious outfit. The Sena may have chosen the BJP as a convenient ally but has always been its watchdog, particularly cornering it on unkept promises and maintaining the big push on Hindutva’s symbolism, Ayodhya. There was a time when everybody had begun to believe that the Sena would be wiped out in the face of the BJP’s onslaught and at best could be a tag-along. Yet, Uddhav held on to the job he knew and cultivated the Marathi pride to get 56 seats, creditable enough to bargain with the BJP, which had slumped to 105. Although many wondered if the Sena was using a bit of fair weather to push for chief ministership, Uddhav kept on insisting that the “son of Balasaheb never lies” and that a rotational chief ministership was indeed discussed with the BJP in pre-poll talks. The BJP, while denying ever promising this, did shuffle its feet on whether it was discussed at all. Uddhav persisted till his claim rang sincere. And for all the poaching expeditions that characterise opportunistic coalitions, Uddhav’s men did not desert him and held fort with a Shivaji-like defiance. Neither did they hold a State to ransom with agitations and strikes to press home their point, knowing full well that if NCP indeed propped up the BJP instead, the party would wilt away under the BJP’s vindictive backlash. It is this quiet patience that might be recontouring the Sena in the long term.","Uddhav Thackeray, though not as flamboyant as his father Balasaheb Thackeray, inherits fearlessness and resilience. Leading the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi, he navigates through political challenges with a reasoned approach. Despite facing BJP's aggression, he maintains Sena's identity and upholds Marathi pride, securing a significant seat share.

She will be the first person to have served as Treasury Secretary, Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Chair of the Federal Reserve. She has previously been confirmed by the Senate on four separate occasions.

Tanden, 50, if confirmed by the Senate, would be the first woman of colour and first Indian-American to lead the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Tanden’s career has focused on pursuing policies designed to support working families, foster broad-based economic growth, and curb rampant inequality.
“Another proud day for Indian Americans to see Neera Tanden be nominated for a Cabinet level position in the next administration. This position at OMB is a wide-ranging role with broad powers to manage trillions of dollars of the US budget. If anyone had any doubts that our community has arrived politically, this election cycle is proof enough,” Indiaspora founder MR Rangaswami, and an eminent philanthropist and venture capitalist, told this agency.

Announcing key members of his economic team, Biden also named Wally Adeyemo, as Deputy Secretary of the Treasury; Cecilia Rouse as Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers; and Jared Bernstein and Heather Boushey, as members of the Council of Economic Advisers.

This crisis-tested team will help Biden administration lift America out of the current economic downturn and build back better — creating an economy that gives every single person across America a fair shot and an equal chance to get ahead, the transition said.

“As we get to work to control the virus, this is the team that will deliver immediate economic relief for the American people during this economic crisis and help us build our economy back better than ever,” Biden said in a statement.

This team is comprised of respected and tested groundbreaking public servants who will help the communities hardest hit by COVID-19 and address the structural inequities in our economy, he said.

“They will work tirelessly to ensure every American enjoys a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead, and that our businesses can thrive and out-compete the rest of the world. This team looks like America and brings seriousness of purpose, the highest degree of competency, and unwavering belief in the promise of America. They will be ready on day one to get to work for all Americans,’ Biden said.

According to Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, this outstanding economic team will help the Biden administration deliver on its commitment. “They are not only some of America’s most brilliant economic minds, they are also proven leaders who reflect the very best of our country,” she said.","US President-elect Joe Biden has appointed Janet Yellen as Treasury Secretary and Neera Tanden as Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

The Pioneer,11/30/0201,Flaws in prison security,"Punjab jail-break is only one of many incidents

The recent incident of Nabha jail-break by Harminder Singh Mintoo, the chief of the banned Khalistan liberation Force (KlF), is shocking. However, a joint operation team of the Delhi and Punjab police which caught him immediately after a day, showed how alert our security forces were. Reports say that Mintoo was in touch with Pakistan-based terror outfits, the senior officials of the Pakistan Army and, most importantly, with the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). These are all old gameplans of Pakistan, through which the country has been trying either to shift its nefarious plans from Jammu & Kashmir to Punjab or to solely focus on vulnerable points with the help of militants based in its territory.

Sources say that Pakistan's harbouring of the Khalistani terror organisations like the Babbar Khalsa International, the Khalistan Tiger's Force (Nijjar-led), the International Sikh Youth Federation and the Khalistan Zindabad Force, is only encouraging such incidents to revive the old terror. Sensing this, the Government of India, particularly the States that are vulnerable to Islamist militancy, should take extraordinary precautionary measures to thwart these kinds of episodes in our jails. It must not be treated only as an instance of security lapse, but also needs to be examined as a huge network that the Pakistan-based Islamists have built with the inmates of Indian jails over the years. Thus, the Mintoo saga and another one that took place in Madhya Prdesh in the same month, should not be simply brushed aside as a seasonal incident. It must be taken as a wake-up call by the prison authorities across India. Also, prisons should not be left entirely to the States, just because prison is listed as a State subject.

The National Crime Records Bureau in its 2015 report stated that more than 27,000 jail vacancies exist as against the sanctioned strength of a little over 80,000. This reflects that there has been a severe staff crunch in the prisons of the country. The report also says that more than 200 inmates escaped in the incidents of jail-break and from custody in 2015. Punjab has a record of more than 41 per cent vacancies in its jails; in 2015, 32 inmates escaped. Apart from this, the report highlighted that vacancies are ranging from the level of ordinary constables to the rank of officers. It is sad that Delhi, which boasts of the country's most high-security Tihar jail, is the third worst when it comes to staff crunch.

The Tihar jail has more than 47 per cent staff vacancies. Ironically, Delhi is currently housing the most overcrowded jails of the country where 200 inmates are being kept, as against a sanctioned strength of 100. Both the Union and the State Governments have to be more tuned in to the basic concerns with regard to adequate jail staff and the number of inmates. Else, jail-breaks will happen. We need an effective and efficient superintendence and maintenance of jails. It is found that since the coming of the ‘Model Prison Manual' in 2003, which was circulated to all the States and Union Territories, very few of the jails have so far adopted it in true spirit. It must be brought to the notice of the public that this manual was made after wide consultations with the State Governments. It is time to tighten our jail security and review the current staff requirements.","The recent jail-break incident at Nabha involving Harminder Singh Mintoo, the leader of Khalistan Liberation Force, highlights serious security concerns in Indian prisons. Mintoo's swift recapture by a joint operation of Delhi and Punjab police underscores vigilance, but also exposes vulnerabilities. Reports suggest links between Mintoo and Pakistan-based terror outfits, indicating broader security threats. The incident urges Indian authorities to enhance prison security nationwide, address staffing shortages, and implement the 'Model Prison Manual' effectively to prevent future escapes and strengthen inmate management.",Crime and Justice,82,567
the hindu,11/4/0013,Rupee to trade in 62-63 range without RBI measures: Assocham,"The rupee is unlikely to fall below 63 to a dollar even if the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) withdraws temporary measures such as direct sale of dollars to oil importing companies and the foreign currency non-resident (FCNR) swap facility put in place to support the currency, as speculative activity around it has mostly ebbed in the foreign exchange market, according to a paper released by the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham).

Besides, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have turned buyers in the capital market and exports have made an impressive rebound — the developments that would lend support to the rupee, which will trade in the range of 62-63, the paper says.

Worries on current account deficit (CAD) have also gone away, and Finance Minister P. Chidambaram has already stated that CAD for the current fiscal would not be more than $60 billion, the paper adds.

“All these positives now set a stage for the RBI for a possible withdrawal of the measures,” the paper says.

“Today, India is much better in terms of its macroeconomic indicators — be it government finances or the overall balance of payments situation,” the paper adds.

The FCNR deposit swap facility, which has already raked in more than $13 billion to the country’s forex kitty, is likely to bring in $20 billion directly to the sovereign treasury when the facility ends by November 30.

Besides, the RBI may end the direct dollar access to the oil importing companies even earlier.

It is only then that the real strength of the rupee will be decided by free market forces, “but we are sure that these market forces are now poised in favour of the Indian currency than the U.S. greenback,” the paper points out.","The article discusses the rupee's expected trading range of 62-63 against the US dollar without the intervention of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), as suggested by the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham). In essence, Assocham believes that the Indian currency will remain stable within this range without the need for RBI's corrective measures. 

This prediction suggests confidence in the Indian economy's stability and resilience, indicating that external factors and economic conditions are conducive to a steady exchange rate. Such a range can be beneficial for businesses, as it provides a predictable environment for trade and investments. It also implies that the rupee's value is expected to be robust enough to withstand fluctuations and external pressures.

However, it's essential to keep in mind that currency markets can be influenced by a variety of factors, including economic data, geopolitical events, and global trends. While Assocham's forecast is positive, it's not an absolute guarantee, and the actual exchange rate will still depend on the dynamic interplay of these factors. Businesses and investors should continue to monitor the forex market and adapt their strategies accordingly, even within the projected range.",Business and Finance,191,293

the new india express,11/6/0224,"Discriminatory wall blocking access to road since 2019, says man, seeks TN govt intervention","THOOTHUKUDI: Laying claim to public roads, pattadars constructed a wall concealing the entrance gates of three houses in Mathavankurichi village near Udangudi. Meanwhile, the occupants of the house have alleged that they are being discriminated against by the perpetrators and urged the district administration to demolish the wall.

In a petition, S Malmarugan, a businessman, said he built a house south of the Thandavankadu-Kulasekarapattinam state highway. However, one Alaguvel built a wall in 2019 blocking the gate of his house and claimed ownership of 2.5 cents of land between Malmarugan’s house and the road.

Sources said the Thandavankadu-Kulasekarapattinam road is supposed to be 53 feet wide. However, pattadars have encroached upon 10 feet of land in front of Malmarugan’s house, and another 30 feet outside the houses near the Mutharaman temple. The width of the state highways has been reduced to 13 feet in front of Malmarugan's house, sources added.

Following litigation and complaints, the Tiruchendur revenue divisional officer (RDO), in an executive order dated October 1, had ruled that the patta for the road was illegal as the occupants did not provide any supporting documents other than a patta and parent documents during inquiries. While the illegal patta names 11 members, many of them had moved away and admitted that they did not have any documents. However, Alaguvel, a relative of one of the pattadars, had claimed ownership, the RDO said.

The RDO's executive order also noted that reports of the village administrative officer, tahsildar, and block development officer (BDO) prove that the supposed land remained unused by the claimants, and was used as a pathway by the general public before and after UDR. Alaguvel does not possess any parent document for the land, and hence, this land should remain as a road, the RDO ruled and also ordered the claimants to appeal against the order within 30 days to the district revenue officer.

Assistant director (Panchayat) S Ulaganathan, on October 17, directed the Udangudi BDO to cancel the permission given to build the wall and restore it as a pathway as it was used before 2019. However, no action was taken.
Speaking to TNIE, Malmarugan said he belongs to the Servaikarar sect of the Shannar community, while Alaguvel belongs to the Nadar community.

Malmarugan, one of the state secretaries of Tamil Manila Congress, said Alaguvel often comes near his house and verbally abuses him for hailing from an ‘inferior’ community. ""Why do you use the name Nadar?"" Alaguvel can be heard shouting at Malmarugan in a video, which the latter also submitted to the Kulasekarapattinam police demanding action. ""The officials refuse to demolish the wall citing law and order issues. The district administration and the police must demolish the wall and ensure social justice,"" Malmarugan said.","A contentious land dispute, exacerbated by alleged caste discrimination, has erupted in Mathavankurichi village, Thoothukudi, where a wall constructed on a public road is blocking access to three houses. S Malmarugan, a businessman, claims a relative of a pattadar, Alaguvel, built the wall in 2019, asserting ownership of 2.5 cents of land.

The Thandavankadu-Kulasekarapattinam state highway, intended to be 53 feet wide, has been severely narrowed to just 13 feet in front of Malmarugan's house due to this and other encroachments. The Tiruchendur Revenue Divisional Officer (RDO) had, on October 1, 2024, ruled the patta for the road illegal, confirming it was a public pathway. This order also stated that Alaguvel lacked parent documents for the land and ordered the land to remain a road.

Despite the RDO's executive order and a subsequent directive from the Assistant Director (Panchayat) on October 17, 2024, to demolish the wall, no action has been taken. Malmarugan, belonging to the Servaikarar sect of the Shannar community, alleges that Alaguvel, from the Nadar community, verbally abuses him with casteist slurs. Malmarugan, a state secretary of Tamil Manila Congress, has appealed to the district administration and police for intervention, stating that officials are hesitant to act due to ""law and order issues"" and urging them to ensure social justice.", Land Encroachment,213,458

Welcoming the Union Government's announcement of demonetisation of Rs.500 and Rs. 1000 currency notes, he said it would root out black money, counterfeit currencies and also eradicate bribe. The supply channel to fundamentalists will also be cut down, he said.

Stating that most of the bribe money is given only by tax-evaders, he said honest tax payers are not able to pay bribe and therefore they are not able to get their rightful services from various sectors.

Mr. Rethinavelu said that the Government could mobilise only Rs. 62,000 crores through the voluntary disclosure of income scheme that ended in September. ""When the Prime Minister said that stern action will be taken against those hoarding black money, people thought it was a usual threat and nothing will happen going by the past experiences. However, Modi has now proven that he practises what he preaches,"" Mr. Rethinavelu said.

He expected that the prices of various commodities and services will come down as black money had been playing its ugly part in abnormal increase of price. Black money was almost a parallel economy threatening to lead to collapse of the nation's economy. But, Mr. Modi has stopped that. He will be remembered as protector of Indian economy, he said.

The last time they spoke was on December 11 when the Assembly results were announced. On December 13, Harish Rao attended KCR’s oath taking ceremony as Chief Minister but there was no conversation between the two.

On the second day after he took oath as Chief Minister, Mr Rao held a review meeting on irrigation projects.

Though Harish Rao had been irrigation minister in the previous cabinet and worked hard to complete flagship irrigation projects — even sleeping for some days at the site of the project — Harish Rao was not invited to attend the review meeting.

MR RAO had dissolved the Assembly nine months before schedule and announced the names of 105 party contestants on the same day, unlike the Congress

HAVING REALISED its mistake, the Congress has decided to announce its Lok Sabha candidates in advance.

Telangana Rashtra Samiti president and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has become a trend setter not only in government schemes but also in electoral strategy. With the Rythu Bandhu (farmers’ investment subsidy) scheme Mr Rao attracted national attention.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is thinking of announcing the same scheme across the country ahead of the Lok Sabha elections.

And Y.S.R. Congress president Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy announced in Ichhapuram on Wednesday that he would implement the same scheme if he is voted to power in the ensuing Andhra Pradesh Assembly elections.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee also announced economic assistance to farmers similar to the Rythu Bandhu scheme.

Political parties are also emulating Mr Rao’s strategy of announcing candidates early in the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections and in Andhra Pradesh in the Assembly elections.

Mr Rao had dissolved the Assembly nine months before schedule, on September 6, 2018, and announced the names of 105 party contestants (of a total 119) on the same day.

The People’s Front led by the Congress did not announce its candidates till the last minute.

By then the TRS candidates had completed their first round of campaigning.

Having realised its mistake, the Congress’s central leadership has decided to announce its Lok Sabha candidates in advance and asked all Pradesh Congress Committees (PCCs) across the country to send their candidates’ lists by the end of this month.

Candidates will be announced in a phased manner by the end of February.

Meanwhile, in Andhra Pradesh, the main political parties, the ruling Telugu Desam, and the YSR Congress, the main Opposition party, are considering announcing their candidates in advance, probably in February.

The convener of the People’s Front, Telangana Jana Samiti (TJS) president Kodandaram, recently said that the main reason for the defeat of the People’s Front was delay in announcing the candidates.

The Central Election Commission is likely to announce the election schedule in the last week of February or in the first week of March 2019.","
A **month-long silence** between Telangana CM **K. Chandrasekhar Rao** (KCR) and his nephew **T. Harish Rao** has sparked speculation about a **rift within the TRS** leadership. Despite Harish Rao's strong contributions as irrigation minister, he was not invited to a key review meeting.

An indication towards this can be gauged from the fact that people gulped almost Rs 926 crore worth of liquor in the last four days of the year. According to officials from the prohibition and excise department, liquor sales worth Rs 926 crore were recorded from December 28 till the night of December 31 with December 30 recording the highest in terms of volume at Rs 402 crore. Incidentally, sales dipped by 29.85 per cent on December 31 compared to the previous day’s high at Rs 282 crore, which officials attribute to shortage of supply.
While liquor worth Rs 51 crore was sold on December 29, it netted Rs 191 crore on December 28. The entire month of December recorded sales worth Rs 3,615 crore. This shows that around 25.6 per cent of liquor was purchased and consumed in the last four days of the month, nay year. However, this is lower than the sale recorded in December 2023, which was estimated at Rs 4,274 crore, while it was a mindboggling Rs 31,000 crore in 2022 December
Excise officials said that around 50 per cent of the liquor that was sold in the state was consumed by people in Hyderabad and Rangareddy districts. Meanwhile, the Telangana Anti-Narcotics Bureau (TGANB), in a joint operation with the excise department, the SOT and the local police caught five persons, who were allegedly under the influence of drugs. No person was caught under the influence of drugs in 2023. According to TGANB director Sandeep Shandilya, none of the DJs at any pub tested positive.

","Telangana witnessed liquor sales worth ₹926 crore in just the last four days of December 2024, with December 30 alone contributing ₹402 crore, marking the highest single-day sales. Despite a 29.85% dip on New Year’s Eve due to supply issues, December's total sales reached ₹3,615 crore, with nearly 25.6% of sales occurring in the final four days. However, this was lower than ₹4,274 crore in December 2023 and ₹31,000 crore in 2022. Hyderabad and Rangareddy districts accounted for nearly 50% of sales.

Financial Express,12/11/0023,Market Rally: Optimising Investment Strategy; Large-cap funds a prudent choice now,"As the benchmark indices touch new highs, individuals need to be prudent about their exposure to equities by
increasing investments in large-cap stocks now as mid-caps and small-caps look overbought suggesting potential
risks, say experts. Many large-cap stocks are seeing robust earnings growth and their valuations are around the longterm average.
The large-caps offer a relatively cheaper investment option compared to mid- and small-caps and would benefit once
interest rates start falling next year. This underlines the importance of prioritising large-cap investments in
anticipation of better returns. Also, large-cap stocks or funds are ideal for new investors as a higher level of due
diligence is needed to differentiate between fundamentally good companies and stocks that are rallying without the
basis of underlying business performance.Nirav Karkera, head, Research, Fisdom, says, when the tide rises and lifts all boats, it is all the more important to be
sure about valuations in the context of headroom for further growth. “Large-caps appear better positioned to benefit
from incremental investor interest in the shorter to medium term,” he saysSimilarly, Harish Menon, co-founder and head of Investments and product research, House of Alpha, says opting for
large-cap stocks appears to be a prudent choice at this juncture. “If foreign investors resume a net buying position,
their focus would primarily be on large-cap stocks in the forthcoming months.”
Weed out the laggards
An investor can consider to exit a fund if it underperforms its benchmark and category over a period of two to three
years. For example, in large-cap funds, the difference between the top performing and the worst performing fund is
14 percentage points over a three-year period.
Even if initial investment choices were flawed, the upswing provides a chance to rectify errors and exit with gains. This
proactive approach allows for the optimisation of portfolios, ensuring a strategic alignment with robust stocks or
funds.
Soumya Sarkar, co-founder, Wealth Redefine, says during bull markets, one should exit unfavourable positions and
pivot toward sound investments. “Identifying subpar stocks or funds presents an opportunity to sell during bullish
phases, locking in profits. By doing so, investors can strategically reallocate funds into more promising assets during
subsequent market downturns,” he says.
Booking profits need a good strategy as sometimes there can be reinvestment risk. “Rebalancing of the portfolio can
be done in such a way where the asset allocation can be realigned not by redeeming but investing in asset classes
where the allocation needs to increase,” says Harshad Chetanwala, co-founder, MyWealthGrowth.com.
Continue with SIPs: Systematic investment plans work in all market conditions without worrying about market levels.
So, despite the surge in the markets, one can start a new SIP or continue with SIPs without thinking too much about
the market. Give sufficient time to these investments to grow. Those seeking to deploy incremental amounts through
SIPs to capture near-term buying opportunities, and as an allocation to the satellite segment of the portfolio, can
maintain a large-cap orientation while being neutral-weighted to mid- and small-cap allocations.
Avoid FOMO in stocks: Investors should stay away from the fear of missing out of investing directly in stocks. It is
important to recognise the cyclical nature of equities and invest based only on conviction derived through thorough
analysis.
","Amid soaring benchmark indices, financial experts advise caution and recommend a shift towards large-cap stocks over mid-caps and small-caps, cautioning of potential risks in the latter due to overvaluation. Large-caps, offering a relatively cheaper investment option with robust earnings growth, are seen as better positioned for potential benefits when interest rates decline. Emphasizing the importance of thorough due diligence, experts suggest prioritizing large-cap investments, especially for new investors. Nirav Karkera of Fisdom advocates assessing valuations for further growth opportunities. Harish Menon from House of Alpha suggests that large-cap stocks are prudent choices, particularly if foreign investors resume net buying positions. Investors are advised to exit underperforming funds based on benchmark and category comparisons over two to three years. This market surge provides an opportunity to rectify flawed investments and strategically reallocate funds into promising assets during subsequent market downturns. Strategies for booking profits include strategic reallocation through rebalancing portfolios and continuing systematic investment plans (SIPs) irrespective of market conditions, allowing investments to grow over time. Additionally, investors are cautioned against succumbing to the fear of missing out (FOMO) and advised to invest based on conviction derived from thorough analysis, avoiding speculative tendencies during market cycles.",Health and Wellness,195,536

""Three product categories (petroleum goods, gems and jewellery and pharmaceuticals) have pulled down our exports,"" Commerce Secretary S R Rao said, adding that these sectors have a major contribution in the country's export basket. India's exports stood at USD 24.6 billion in November 2013 as against US $ 23.25 billion in the same month last year.

However, a 16.3 per cent decline in imports particularly gold and silver during the month helped in narrowing the trade deficit to US $ 9.21 billion in November, which is second lowest level during the ongoing fiscal.

In September, the trade gap fell to USD 6.76 billion. Imports in November stood at USD 33.83 billion, which is the lowest figure since March 2011. Trade deficit in November 2012 was at US $ 17.2 billion. Gold and silver imports in November dipped by 80.49 per cent to US $ 1.05 billion from USD 5.4 billion in the same period last year. Oil imports too dipped by 1.1 per cent to USD 12.96 billion during the month. Rao said that gems and jewellery exports declined due to increase in the prices of rough diamonds.

""The cost of rough diamonds have gone up significantly as a result of which traders did not purchase the diamonds during November. And as regards to petroleum products, I believe couple of refineries were shut (due to maintenance). Also, there has been reduction in pharmaceutical exports,"" he said.

Commenting on the figures, Apparel Export Promotion Council Chairman A Sakthivel said in the coming months exports would pick up fast. In April-November 2013, exports grew by 6.27 per cent to US $ 204 billion while imports aggregated at USD 304 billion. Trade deficit for the period stands at USD 100 billion.

THE TIMES OF INDIA,12/13/0006,Egypt asks 'toxic ship' papers from India,"
NEW DELHI: The Clemen-ceau, sailing to India with a toxic shipload, found itself in troubled waters on Thursday.Two activists from Greenpeace boarded the French aircraft carrier 50 nautical miles from the Egyptian coast.

By evening, Greenpeace activists here were euphorically stating the Egyptian authorities had asked France and India to provide papers to prove the ship wasn't breaching an international convention on transportation of hazardous waste.

They said if it was, it would be considered ""illicit sailing"" punishable under Egyptian law and might be ordered back to France.
Greenpeace campaigners, who had asked Egypt not to allow the Clemenceau to enter the Suez Canal on its way to Alang, now want citizens to tell environment minister A Raja to 'say no to Clemenceau' by sending him a message and telling him just what they think.
The aircraft carrier, headed to Gujarat's ship-breaking yard at Alang for dismantling, has seen environmental activists led by Greenpeace fight in France and India to keep the shipload of hazardous waste, including asbestos, out of India.


They maintain it will damage the environment as well as the health of unprotected workers at Alang who will be breaking it down. They maintain the French authorities have not decontaminated the ship as promised.


The French government has been dismissing talk of hazards. The Indian government sees no legal controversy yet but says it can only check how much asbestos is on board once the ship is about to enter Indian waters.

A worried Supreme Court monitoring committee met last Friday to recommend the ship be kept out of Indian waters till it took a final view on what needs to be done. Its decision is expected on January 20.","The French aircraft carrier, Clemenceau, en route to India with a shipment of hazardous waste, faced scrutiny after Greenpeace activists boarded it near the Egyptian coast.

Greenpeace urged citizens to urge Environment Minister A Raja to reject the entry of the Clemenceau into Indian waters by sending messages expressing their concerns. The ship, destined for the ship-breaking yard at Alang, Gujarat, has faced opposition from environmentalists who fear its toxic cargo, including asbestos, will harm both the environment and workers' health.

The Imphal Free Press,12/13/0024,Climate change and water problem in Northeast states,"The Northeast India, which normally receives heavy rainfall during the monsoon months (June-September), has changed character for the worse. The flood-drought cycle now has begun to happen within a year, especially during the monsoon. The rains come in quick bursts and flood the region, followed by elongated dry periods that border on drought. The climate of Northeast India is changing: Rainfall patterns over the region in the last century have considerably changed, resulting in its overall drying up. The crux behind climate change-induced water problems in the Northeast is the drying up of the mountain springs, which feed every other water source in the region.

As many as 200 mountain springs, direct primary sources of water for mountainous villages in the state, have dried up due to a decrease in rainfall, Arunachal Pradesh’s environment minister had said in 2018.“With climate change and rising temperatures, rise in rainfall intensity and reduction in its temporal spread as well as a marked decline in winter rain, the problem of dying springs is being increasingly felt across the Indian Himalayan Region,” a NITI Aayog report said. This points to a grim situation for all mountainous regions of the northeastern states as they are mostly dependent on these springs to meet their water needs. In Sikkim, over 94 per cent villages have mountain springs. In Meghalaya, Mizoram and Manipur, 55.7, 54.6 and 54.4 per cent villages have them.


Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh have 44.7 and 37.3 per cent villages with springs. The springs contribute a large share to the base flow of the large Himalayan Rivers such as the Brahmaputra— more than glaciers, ice and snow — according to the report. This means that those living in the plains, especially in Assam, will also be affected by the drying up of these springs.


“The drying of springs in Northeast India may be because of human-induced geological and land use changes, along with the impact of climate change, especially rainfall. The springs have to be studied in great detail to ascertain the exact causes of the decrease in water flow. But Assam has another worry: The groundwater levels are closely related to the flow of water in the Brahmaputra.


“This is because the change in Brahmaputra’s altitude is only 90 metres between its entry into the plains in Pasighat (Arunachal) and its forming of a delta (in Bangladesh). This means that the difference between the river flow levels and the groundwater levels is less. So if there is little rainfall in the catchments it will affect the flow of the rivers and along with that the ground water levels will also be impacted.”


Another aspect is that the soils of the Brahmaputra are mostly sandy and their water retention capacity is low, which creates a fear of water scarcity. Assam “has the least area under irrigation, least forest area available per 1,000 rural households and the second lowest per capita income among the Indian Himalayan states,” found a climate vulnerability assessment by Indian Institute of Technology Mandi, Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar and Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. These factors make the state, among other Himalayan states, the most vulnerable to climate change.
Mizoram comes second close based on similar reasons. The assessment was carried out using four broad indicators: Socioeconomic, demographic status and health, sensitivity of agricultural production, forest dependent livelihoods and access to information services and infrastructure. These were then divided into more sub-indicators. Among the top five states most vulnerable to climate change in the Himalayan region, four are from Northeast India.


Action plans on climate change by the northeastern states have identified the change in rainfall patterns as one of the major causes of vulnerability to climate change. The riverine islands of the Brahmaputra, for example, have been identified as the most vulnerable to health impacts of climate change owing to frequent floods caused by heavy rainfall in the region and in upstream areas.


Assam’s state action plan on climate change said: “According to the Union Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region and the North Eastern Council, those living on the small islands in the Brahmaputra are the most vulnerable to disease outbreaks. They are isolated from the rest of Assam, have no permanent healthcare facilities and are prone to frequent flooding.


As climate change continues, these islands will become increasingly vulnerable and hence public health facilities need to be extended to such areas effectively”. Assam experienced major floods in 1954, 1962, 1972, 1977, 1984, 1988, 1998, 2002, 2004 and 2012.The state suffers losses of Rs 200 crore or more every year due to foods, according to the state’s government.


“Crop failure due to high rainfall variability and increased crop water needs” is identified by Manipur’s state action plan on climate change as one of the major impacts of climate change on agriculture and its allied sectors in the state. The state does not suffer from floods usually, but has witnessed some in recent years. For instance, in June 2018, the most flood-affected districts — Imphal, Ukhrul and Thoubal — covered 25 per cent of the total area of the state. 


Another consequence of the untimely and excessive rains is that large parts of northeastern states have become degraded, which has a direct consequence for the region’s main occupation — agriculture. Land in the northeastern states has become degraded to a great extent, according to a draft report on land degradation prepared by the Indian Space Research Organisation’s (ISRO) National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) that came out in November 2018.Among the top seven states with the highest increase in land degradation in the last 10 years, six are in the Northeast.


Nagaland has 47 per cent of its land area under degradation, after Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, which have 53 and 52 per cent, degraded land area.  In Manipur, Mizoram and Meghalaya, 38, 35 and 28 per cent of land is degraded. One of the major causes of this degradation could be increased frequency of high rainfall events in the region. The degradation could, in fact, be one of the reasons for the devastating surface floods, flash floods and landslides throughout the region of the country in 2018.Five states — Assam, Manipur, Tripura, Mizoram and Nagaland — suffered from minor to major floods in 2018. More than water erosion, which worsens floods, the report found that the most common cause of land degradation in these states is acidification.
In the top eight states in the country where acidification is the most rampant, seven are in the northeast. The highest among these is Nagaland where almost 7.5 lakh hectares of land area is acidic which constitutes around 45 per cent of the total area of the state. Manipur comes second with 6.3 lakh hectare acidified land, which is more than 28 per cent of its total geographical area.


Only in Arunachal Pradesh and Assam the degradation caused by water erosion is greater than that caused by acidification. Acidity is measured in terms of the concentration of hydrogen ions (pH) in the soil as they are essential for the formation of all acids. Acidification of soil or land takes place when the pH balance of the soil shifts towards acidic nature due to an excessive presence of hydrogen ions. 


Soil acidity increases when metallic minerals such as calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium are lost from the soil and only hydrogen ions remain. These minerals get removed from soils due to heavy rainfall and flooding. They also get removed with crop residue or harvest hay.


Land in the Northeast is naturally acidic because it receives heavy rainfall every year. Climate change-induced high frequency of heavy rainfall events will further exacerbate the acidification, which will decrease the quality of soil. In a region that is predominantly dependent on agriculture, with 70 per cent of the population engaged in farming, such loss of arable land could spell doom for livelihood. Using lime and organic manure in the soil can help the situation.


Acidification can also be remedied by adopting nutrient management practices and smart crop selection. Land degradation exacerbates other impacts of climate change too. The region is rich in biodiversity. As many as 5,000 of the 17,000 flowering plants in the country are found in the region. Dams and other constructions as well as deforestation have compounded the challenges posed by the crisis.


“The most dramatic changes in the land use in the Northeast, especially Assam, has come from the arrival of sand that is much coarser than before. “The volume of sediments carried by the Ganga and Brahmaputra every year can be loaded into 20,000 million trucks. The sand in Brahmaputra has now become coarser, replacing the earlier softer sand and more fertile alluvial soils that are bad for agriculture. This sand has had a visible impact on the rice fields of Assam, whose productivity has diminished. Unless we take the proper course of action timely, doomsday will knock our door in the near future.


 ","Climate change in Northeast India has led to altered rainfall patterns, causing a flood-drought cycle within a year.

The Tribune,12/14/0003,SAD’s conditional offer to CM,"Accusing the Congress leadership and its successive government at the Centre and in Punjab of bartering away the interests of the state for remaining in power, the SAD (Badal) today passed a resolution vowing to fight for the interests of Punjab especially its right on river waters per riparian principles by observing 2003 as the year of the struggle.

At the party’s conference organised here today to mark sacrifices by 40 Muktas (Liberated ones), in connection the SAD leadership with the supreme unfolding its agenda to protect the rights and interests of Punjab declared that it would fight a political battle to get justice for Punjab and would not allow its water to flow to Haryana through the SYL canal even if the Supreme Court decided in its (Haryana’s) favour.

The SAD (Badal) President, Mr Parkash Singh Badal said that the party would at any cost to safeguard the interests of Punjab and struggle to press the state Congress government to restore benefits given to people by the previous SAD BJP government, and which had been withdrawn by the Congress government to restore benefits given to people by the previous SAD BJP government, and which had been withdrawn by the Congress government led by Capt. Amarinder Singh.

The time has come for the Punjabis to fight against the anti-Punjab and anti-Punjabi steps of Captain Amarinder Singh, following one-point programme of victimising the Akalis under the garb of anti-corruption campaign,” said Mr Badal addressing here.

The Nehru family including Late Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, Late Indira Gandhi and Late Rajiv Gandhi betrayed Punjab and caused major setback to the state socially, economically, politically and religiously during their leadership. Now the SAD (Badal) would have to fight to protect the interests of Punjab.

He, however, added that if Captain Amarinder Singh was serious about protecting Punjab’s right over river waters he should first condemn the initiation of the digging of SYL canal by Late Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi and then withdrawal of case filed by him (Mr Badal) in the Supreme Court against the SYL canal by Congress Chief Minister, Late Darbara Singh.

If Capt Amarinder Singh did so, the SAD (Badal) would extend him support in his “so called” fight against the completion of SYL canal. He added that party’s MLAs would attend the special session of the Vidhan Sabha on the SYL canal issue proposed to be called by the Congress government.

The resolution, was read by Capt Kanwaljit Singh, former state Finance Minister

Former Union Minister, Sukhbir Badal alleged that intention of Capt Amarinder Singh in connection with protecting the interests of Punjab particularly, the share in river water was evident from the fact that his government had filed the petition in the Supreme Court in the nick of time.

Mr Ashok Pardhan, Union Labour Minister, who was the main speaker at the conference, while not touching the SYL canal issue, alleged that the Congress was following pseudo-secularism and added that it was the Congress which engineered anti-Sikh riots in Delhi in 1984 and the Godhra incident in Gujarat last year. He appealed to people that if they wanted people-oriented government led y Mr Badal in Punjab again, they should oust the Congress in the Assembly elections in Himachal.

Union Minister Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa while warning Capt Amarinder Singh for harassing the Akalis under the garb of anti-corruption drive, said that the Congress government should set up a judicial commission headed y a sitting judge of the Punjab and Haryana High court to probe misdeeds, if any. He added that the Akalis would give a befitting reply of the atrocities being committed against them by the police.

Those, who attended that conference included, Prof Kirpal Singh Badungar, President, SGPC, Mr Tota Singh, Mr Chiranji Lal Garg, Mr Balwinder Singh Bhunder and Mr Sikander Singh (all former ministers) and Mr Zora Singh Mann, MP, Ferozepore.","The Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal) passed a resolution to fight for the interests of Punjab, particularly its right to river waters, declaring 2003 as the year of the struggle.

Hindustan Times,12/15/0006,The Slippery Slope of Stings,"After the success of the Aaj Tak–Cobrapost sting, nearly everybody in the media has got used to the concept of the sting operation-for-hire. The way it works is this: an enterprising journalist/web site/small news organisation sets up a sting operation. When the results are in and the victims are trapped on audio or video tape, the perpetrators of the sting approach a large media outlet and offer to sell the story.

Faced with this kind of offer, many large news organisations are tempted to bite. Stings are very much the flavour of the month. For TV news channels functioning in an extremely competitive environment, they provide an opportunity to win the ratings wars and — when the story spills over into other news media — to capture the mind space of target audiences.

Moreover, a sting is — almost by definition — the sort of story that a proper TV journalist cannot do. It requires ‘reporters’ to masquerade as other people and most TV journos — whose faces are well-known from repeated  exposure on the box — lack the anonymity required to pretend to be arms dealers/star aspirants/whatever. Far easier, therefore, to buy the story from somebody else who has hired unknown faces and done the dirty work required to set the traps.

","The rise of ""sting operation-for-hire"" schemes worries the author. These involve small outlets setting up stings, trapping people on tape, and then selling the story to bigger media for profit.

Larger media, hungry for ratings and exclusive content, find these stings tempting even if they involve questionable journalism methods like deception. They lack the anonymity needed for effective undercover work themselves.

This raises concerns about journalistic ethics and potential exploitation as stories are bought instead of independently investigated. Ultimately, the author seems uneasy with this outsourcing of potentially crucial reporting. ",Local News,90,213
Indian Express,12/15/0010,"India Unveils ""Arogya Bharti"": A Revolutionary Healthcare Initiative for Rural Communities","In a groundbreaking move to address the healthcare needs of rural populations, India unveiled ""Arogya Bharti,"" a transformative healthcare initiative aimed at improving access to quality medical services in remote and underserved areas. Launched on December 15, 2010, ""Arogya Bharti"" represents a bold step towards achieving health equity and universal healthcare coverage for all Indians, regardless of their socio-economic status or geographical location.

Under the ""Arogya Bharti"" program, the government plans to establish a network of mobile health clinics equipped with state-of-the-art medical facilities and staffed by qualified healthcare professionals. These mobile clinics will traverse rural regions, providing preventive, diagnostic, and curative healthcare services to communities that lack access to regular healthcare facilities.

Moreover, ""Arogya Bharti"" will leverage telemedicine technology to connect remote villages with specialist doctors and healthcare institutions located in urban centers. Through teleconsultations and tele-diagnosis, patients in rural areas will have access to expert medical advice and treatment options, reducing the need for costly and time-consuming travel to distant healthcare facilities.

The initiative also emphasizes community participation and health education, empowering local residents to take charge of their health and well-being through awareness campaigns, health screenings, and preventive healthcare programs. By fostering a culture of health consciousness and disease prevention, ""Arogya Bharti"" aims to reduce the burden of preventable illnesses and improve overall health outcomes in rural communities.

Furthermore, ""Arogya Bharti"" will prioritize maternal and child healthcare, with a focus on prenatal care, safe childbirth practices, immunizations, and nutrition programs. By strengthening maternal and child health services, the initiative aims to reduce maternal and infant mortality rates and ensure the healthy development of children in rural areas.

The launch of ""Arogya Bharti"" reflects India's commitment to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal of ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all. By investing in comprehensive healthcare initiatives tailored to the needs of rural populations, India aims to bridge the healthcare gap between urban and rural areas and create a healthier, more resilient society.

As ""Arogya Bharti"" rolls out across the country, it holds the promise of transforming the healthcare landscape of rural India, bringing quality medical services closer to those who need them the most and ushering in a new era of health and prosperity for millions of underserved communities.

","India introduced ""Arogya Bharti,"" a pioneering healthcare initiative for rural communities, on December 15, 2010. The program aims to improve access to quality medical services through mobile health clinics, telemedicine, community participation, and maternal and child healthcare interventions.

Yadav acknowledged on Wednesday that senior leaders of Congress and SP had not only been in touch but had also discussed the matter in Lok Sabha. The CM, however, reiterated that SP national president Mulayam Singh Yadav would take the final decision.
""I have said that the SP will form the majority government. But if there is an alliance, we will get over 300 seats. However, I will not make that decision. It is for the national president to decide. We will benefit the most from an alliance,"" Akhilesh said, preferring to keep political circles abuzz over the various political possibilities in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh.
Charging Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party with having a ""tacit understanding"" with the ruling BJP, chief minister Akhilesh Yadav also said the BJP had transferred its votes to the BSP in 2012, a favour that the BSP had returned by transferring its votes to the BJP at every booth in Uttar Pradesh during the general elections in 2014.


The BSP, despite finishing with 19.77% votes in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, had remained unsuccessful in bagging a single seat in the lower house of Parliament. With Mayawati and Samajwadi party caught in a bitter battle of words as UP polls near, both Akhilesh and Mayawati have been trading charges over having a back channel talks with the ruling BJP in Delhi.
The allegation, if it sticks, has the potential to cost either parties the support of 18% Muslim voters in UP. Speaking on the sidelines of an event to launch 21 development projects of about Rs 45,000 crore in Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway Industrial Authority, Akhilesh said, ""BSP is levelling allegations against us because of the BJP. BSP transferred votes to the BJP at every polling booth in 2014. Samajwadi people, on the other hand, worked for the welfare of people and there is no one who can match us in speed, quantum or quality.""

Goa Chronicle,12/15/0025,HC directs special court to expedite Elgaar Parishad case,"Mumbai: The Bombay High Court has directed the special court designated under the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act to expedite the trial in the Elgaar Parishad case and said that the framing of charges be completed within nine months, a lawyer said here on Wednesday.

The division bench of Justices A S Gadkari and Kamal Khata gave direction while granting bail to Elgaar Parishad accused activists Rona Wilson and Sudhir Dhavale, citing prolonged incarceration of over six and a half years without trial since they were arrested in June 2018.

The bail was granted on Jan 8, while the detailed copy of the order was made available on January 15.

A total of 16 people were arrested in this case, while 10 people were granted bail in the case that was registered by Pune police in 2018 alleging that the accused were involved in provocative speeches delivered at the Elgar Parishad conclave held in Pune on December 31, 2017, triggering violence at Koregaon-Bhima in Pune district the next day.

The Pune police had claimed the conclave was backed by the Maoists.

Varavara Rao, Sudha Bharadwaj, Anand Teltumbde, Vernon Gonsalves, Arun Ferreira, Shoma Sen, Gautam Navlakha, and Mahesh Raut are among the accused who were granted bail earlier.

However, Raut remained inside jail after the NIA challenged his bail order in the Supreme Court. On Tuesday the special NIA court granted him interim bail for 18 days to enable him to appear for an LLB exam.

Stan Swamy, one of the accused, died in 2021 while in prison.

The National Investigation Agency (NIA) took over the probe from Pune police, and a chargesheet has been filed in the case. However, the special NIA court is yet to frame charges against the accused.

In August 2021, the NIA submitted a chargesheet claiming that the accused in the case were active members of the banned terrorist organisation and alleged that they wanted to establish a “janta sarkar” via revolution supported by a commitment to protracted armed struggle to undermine and seize power from the state.

The accused were charged with over a dozen offences, including “promoting enmity between different groups” and “doing acts prejudicial to the maintenance of harmony,” “waging war against the government,” and several sections under the stringent anti-terror law Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.

","The Bombay High Court has directed the special court under the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act to expedite the Elgaar Parishad case trial and complete the framing of charges within nine months, addressing concerns over prolonged incarceration of accused without trial. This directive was issued while granting bail to activists Rona Wilson and Sudhir Dhavale, who had been in custody for over six and a half years since their arrest in June 2018.

A total of 16 people were arrested in connection with alleged provocative speeches at the Elgar Parishad conclave in Pune in December 2017, which authorities claim triggered violence at Koregaon-Bhima the following day. The case, initially investigated by Pune Police and later transferred to the NIA, involves charges under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and the Indian Penal Code, including ""waging war against the government"" and ""promoting enmity between groups"".

While 10 of the accused have been granted bail, the trial has faced significant delays, with the prosecution citing over 360 witnesses and the special court yet to frame charges. The High Court’s intervention aims to ensure timely judicial process in a case marked by lengthy pre-trial detention and complex legal proceedings.

"Goa Chronicle,",12/15/0025,"If You Fight the Indian State, Rahul Gandhi, India Will Fight You—and You Can Never Win","Rahul Gandhi, the scion of India’s most prominent political dynasty, has often positioned himself as the voice of dissent against the current government. His rhetoric frequently portrays him as a crusader for justice, democracy, and the so-called “idea of India.” But in his quest to challenge the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Gandhi often crosses the line between legitimate opposition and undermining the very institutions and values that define the Indian state.

Recently, Gandhi stoked significant controversy by alleging that the Congress Party was not fighting a fair fight. He claimed that their battle was not just against the BJP or its ideological parent, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), but against the “Indian State itself.” Speaking to a gathering, Gandhi declared:

“Do not think that we are fighting a fair fight. There is no fairness in this. If you believe that we are fighting a political organisation called the BJP or RSS, you have not understood what is going on. The BJP and the RSS have captured every single institution of our country. We are now fighting the BJP, the RSS, and the Indian State itself.”

These remarks, shocking in their breadth and implications, not only drew sharp criticism from the ruling BJP but also raised questions about the Congress leader’s understanding of the Indian state. His comments suggest a troubling conflation of political opposition with a broader attack on India’s institutions, institutions that have evolved over decades as the bedrock of the nation’s democracy.

India is one of the world’s oldest civilizations and largest democracies, built on a foundation of resilience, diversity, and unity. Its statehood transcends politics, representing the sovereignty of its people. For Gandhi or anyone else to conflate opposition to a government with opposition to the state is both misguided and dangerous.

Criticism of government policies is not only healthy but essential for democracy. However, Gandhi’s repeated attempts to internationalize domestic issues, question the integrity of Indian institutions, and now allege that the state itself is the enemy go beyond constructive criticism. Such actions erode public trust in the very systems that hold the nation together.

Over the years, Gandhi has made statements that have raised eyebrows and drawn sharp criticism. His speech at Cambridge University in 2023, where he claimed that Indian democracy was “under attack,” was widely seen as an attempt to tarnish India’s global image. Now, with his assertion that the Congress is fighting the “Indian State itself,” Gandhi has moved from dissent to dangerous rhetoric.

The idea that the BJP and RSS have captured every institution in the country is not only exaggerated but also dismissive of the democratic will of the people. Indian institutions, though not perfect, have shown remarkable resilience in adapting to the challenges of governance in a diverse and populous nation. Gandhi’s sweeping generalizations undermine faith in these institutions and alienate the very citizens he seeks to rally.

History has shown that those who pit themselves against the Indian state invariably fail. The Indian state, rooted in the collective spirit of its people, has withstood countless challenges, from external invasions to internal insurgencies. Leaders who misinterpret this resilience as a weakness or an opportunity for exploitation have faced the consequences.

The Indian people are deeply patriotic. While they may criticize governments and policies, their allegiance to the nation is unwavering. When Gandhi or his party frames their opposition as a fight against “Hindutva nationalism” or “authoritarianism,” they often alienate the very citizens they claim to represent. This alienation was evident in the 2019 general elections, where the Congress party suffered its worst defeat in history, securing just 52 seats.

The Indian state, despite its challenges, remains robust because it is underpinned by the strength of its citizens. When Gandhi or any leader undermines the state, it triggers a natural response from the people. This is not about blind loyalty to the government of the day but a collective instinct to protect the nation’s sovereignty and unity.

Gandhi often frames his fight as one against authoritarianism, yet his approach reeks of entitlement. He seems to believe that his family legacy grants him the moral high ground to question the state without consequence. This is a miscalculation. India has moved beyond dynastic politics and personality cults. The people demand accountability, transparency, and meritocracy—values that Gandhi’s politics often fail to embody.

Rahul Gandhi must recalibrate his approach if he hopes to remain relevant in Indian politics. Instead of framing his opposition as a fight against the state, he should focus on presenting a credible alternative to the government. This involves constructive criticism, policy innovation, and a deep engagement with the electorate.

Moreover, Gandhi must recognize that patriotism and opposition are not mutually exclusive. A leader can criticize the government while simultaneously strengthening the nation’s institutions and values. This requires maturity, vision, and a willingness to rise above petty politics.

 The Indian state is not a monolith—it is a living, breathing entity shaped by the dreams and struggles of its people. To fight the state is to fight the essence of India itself, a battle that is not only futile but self-defeating. Rahul Gandhi’s current trajectory pits him against this collective will, making it impossible for him to win.

India is a resilient democracy, capable of absorbing dissent and evolving through challenges. However, it is also a nation that demands respect for its institutions, values, and sovereignty. Gandhi must decide whether he wants to be remembered as a leader who strengthened India or one who squandered his potential in a futile fight against its soul.

","Rahul Gandhi, a key figure in the Indian National Congress and scion of India’s most famous political family, has sparked controversy by claiming that his party is not just fighting the BJP and RSS, but the “Indian State itself.” His remarks, made in the context of alleged institutional capture by the ruling party, have drawn sharp criticism for conflating legitimate political opposition with opposition to the Indian state and its institutions.

Critics argue that Gandhi’s rhetoric risks undermining public faith in the democratic institutions that underpin India’s sovereignty and unity. While dissent and criticism of government are vital in a democracy, framing political struggles as battles against the state itself is seen as both misguided and potentially dangerous. Such statements, along with previous international comments about Indian democracy being “under attack,” are viewed as damaging to India’s global image and internal cohesion.

The article contends that Indian democracy, though imperfect, has shown resilience and adaptability, and that leaders who position themselves against the state rather than the government often alienate the public. Gandhi is urged to recalibrate his approach—focusing on constructive criticism, policy alternatives, and engagement with the electorate—rather than framing his opposition as a fight against the very institutions that define India. The piece concludes that true leadership involves strengthening, not undermining, the nation’s democratic fabric.

ECONOMIC TIMES,12/20/0015,Rupert Murdoch owned British tabloid 'The Sun',"ONDON: Rupert Murdoch owned top-selling British tabloid 'The Sun' has scrapped its infamous Page 3 which featured topless women, ending a 44-year-old tradition that has been criticised for being sexist, offensive and anachronistic.

The decision was hailed by critics who have campaigned against the sexist and offensive images.

According to insiders, the controversial feature would be removed from the print edition but would continue online.

'The Times', which is also owned by Murdoch, had reported that last Friday's edition of the paper would be the last to ""carry an image of a glamour model with bare breasts on that page"".

Instead, the pictures will now show scantily-clad women. In Monday's issue, the model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley was shown wearing Marks & Spencer underwear.

A spokesperson for the campaign group No More Page 3 said: ""This could be truly historic news and a great day for people power.""

It ""could be a huge step for challenging media sexism"". Topless Page 3 models were introduced by the tabloid in 1970, less than a year after media tycoon Murdoch bought the title.

Reportedly, the change may be reversed if it results in a noticeable drop in sales of the 'Sun'.

Publisher News UK has previously publicly argued that the feature remains popular with its readers and those who want rid of it do not buy the paper.

 the morung times ,12/20/0217,What's There In 2018 calendar,"2017 is coming to an end and by now most of the Unions and Hoho’s might have had their general meeting, planned out proposals for 2018 and waiting with folded hands for the countdown. If then, what’s there in 2018 calendar? Organizing raffle draws, bringing out calendars for union’s fund raiser, organizing revivals, sponsoring missionaries, celebrating jubilees, organizing festivals as usual or do we take into consideration the issues which are real and serious threats for the survival of our people as a whole like corruption, nepotism, illegal immigrants, unemployment, border issues and underdevelopment which are eating our society from inside and for which we need a remedy from within our society.  

Nagaland and Nagas are made up of individuals, families, clans, villages and tribes as one. Our common threats and problems cannot be solve by one single organization like ACAUT or Survival Nagaland without the active participation of all the people from the grass root nor will it make any sense to hand over the readymade solution to Nagas unless we felt it ourselves the problems that are threatening the existence of Nagas at present. It is common sense that only when the problems that are destroying our society is felt and discussed at the kitchen and dining table of all the families, clans, villages and tribes and come together as one to shoulder the responsibilities that we Nagas have at present, we can counter the antisocial elements face on and deal with it appropriately. However determined or strong, it is not possible to single handedly fight the common enemy of Nagas nor is it possible to win over issues like corruption by single organization like ACAUT.  

The year 2017 has witness how much we Nagas can do and achieve by the sacrifice of few brave people and organizations with the support of handful of Samaritans but the real battle is yet to be fought. All the stakeholders have to play their role. Victory is assured if we stand together with will and determination. Today, on average we have enough rich people. We have enough educated people. But education, wealth or money is not enough. Nor is dream, vision or wishes sufficed to win the battle of corruption. But we need to have spine, will and determination as an individual and as a society from grass root level to the top and act together. Then only we can bring about tangible transformation in our society to salvage our land from imbedding doom.  

We are not corrupt by birth nor is our land barren. Our believe system (gospel) is also not at fault. But our system is corrupt and rotten from inside. Therefore, we have to fight together and destroy this corrupt system shouldering little bit of inconvenience on our part. Our past tells us that we are not coward by birth nor did we fought invaders with wealth or sophisticated weapons or by intellect. But we fought together with determination and will as a human race with common sense and bravery. If it is true that the future is determine by what we do or plan out today, 2018 will depend on what resolution our organizations have taken in their respective meetings. Therefore, why not we the Nagas, as an individual, clans, villages, tribes, both in rural and urban areas recognize, understand and accept corruption, nepotism, ism, illegal immigrants, unemployment and underdevelopment as the real issue facing us today and make plans to fight them at every level from the smallest to the largest organization in Nagaland.  

In the 50s Nagas faced problems from outside and we won. Whether the crooked world acknowledge it or not, today our greatest threat is from inside. Can we come together as one nation, one people and face the menace in 2018 much more harder than in 2017 or will 2018 just going to be like other previous years – busy planning for revival, jubilees, bringing out calendars, selling lottery ticket, hosting rock shows and house to house visit in small groups for donation, raising fund for so and so social fantasies in the midst of political turmoil when our real threats are ignored as usual. What’s there in 2018 calendar Nagas? It’s high time for a reality check. Few brave Nagas roared in 2017. Why not Nagas roar together once again against corruption in 2018 and show the world that the present generations of Nagas are not coward. ","The article urges Nagas to prioritize fighting internal issues like corruption, nepotism, and underdevelopment over routine cultural events in 2018. It emphasizes collective action from grassroots to tribal leadership, stressing unity, willpower, and responsibility to bring societal reform and preserve their future, rather than relying on a few brave individuals alone.", Socio-political commentary,51,736

Verdict

Gadgets and technology help us in doing nearly everything better and staying fit is no exception. Whether you’re a long-term fitness buff or just getting started on the path of getting into shape, a fitness tracker is one of the best gadgets one can get. These wrist-worn (generally) devices can not only track human body’s vital signs like heart rate, but also log fitness-related data such as step count, calories burnt, sleep activity and more. This data can be then used to create personalized fitness goals and diet plans, thus leading to a healthier lifestyle.When it comes to fitness trackers, Fitbit is a name that needs no introduction. The company recently launched two new products – Charge 2 and Flex 2. Of these, the more expensive Charge 2 is an upgrade to the Fitbit Charge HR, which is now almost two years old.We tested the Fitbit Charge 2 for a few days, using it for tracking everything from sleeping patterns to daily walks. So, is the Fitbit Charge 2 and its promise of a healthier lifestyle any good, especially at an asking price of Rs 14,999? Let’s find out.Fitbit Charge 2 is essentially comprises two components – tracker module and wrist band. The wrist band is made from a flexible elastomer material and comes with a stainless-steel buckle for fastening the Charge 2 around the wrist. The outer side of the band is textured, while the underside is smooth. The wrist band is removable and can be swapped with one of the many designer bands, which have to be purchased separately. Since it’s sweat proof, the wrist band doesn’t irritate the skin even when the Charge 2 is worn on the wrist for an extended period of time.As for the tracker module itself, its frame is made from stainless steel. On the top rests a slightly curved black glass, under which hides a large (at least as compared to the Charge HR) OLED display. The left and right sides of the frame are chamfered and a navigation button lies on the left, the only button on the Fitbit Charge 2.Flip the Charge 2 and you see the optical heart rate tracker with two flashing LEDs (one each at the top and bottom of the tracking chip). There are also three charging contacts at the bottom, which work by making contact with the pins on the clip-on charger. Other important components include a 3-axis accelerometer, an altimeter and a vibration motor.Overall, we found the design and build quality of the Fitbit Charge 2 to be really good. While the tracker module is quite solid, the wrist band is flexible yet sturdy enough to withstand daily wear and tear.Fitbit Charge 2 comes with a touch-capable OLED screen that automatically turns on when the wearer flicks the wrist, although this functionality can be disabled in the Fitbit app. The display can also be turned on with a double-tap or by pressing the navigation button on the side.Though the display shows time and date by default, users also have the option to choose from the various styles available. To change the display style, simply select it from the ‘Clock Display’ option in the Fitbit app and sync the tracker with the app. The display can be single-tapped repeatedly to flip through daily activity stats like calories burnt and floors climbed.As for the navigation, pressing the navigation button on the left repeatedly moves through various menu options (e.g. Heart Rate, Stopwatch). While a menu item is active, its related options can be cycled through by tapping the display. Lastly, long-pressing the side navigation button starts/stops the function associated with a menu item (e.g. Run).Interestingly, on-screen options can also be shuffled through by tapping anywhere on the wristband.Fitbit Charge 2 works in tandem with the Fitbit app (available on all platforms). You also need to create a free Fitbit account (if you don’t already have one) to login to the app. The account/profile creation includes entering essential body statistics like weight and height, as these are required for setting up personalized meal plans and weight goals.Once you login with your Fitbit account, it’s generally easy to pair the Charge 2 with the smartphone over Bluetooth using the app. But sometimes, the tracker does take a bit of a trial-and-error to get paired up. After pairing, you can simply wear the Charge 2 on the wrist (it can be worn on either of the wrists) and it will start doing its thing.

What's in a credit score?

Spee

d, convenience and flexibility

What's keeping you from buying that smartphone you had set your eyes on for ages? If you're a student or a young professional, chances are that you simply don't have enough to spare for the buy . While the former does not have regular channels of income, the latter may struggle to save enough after paying the bills. A convenient solution is to pay it off in EMIs. However, this is easier said than done, since bank loans come with their own set of conditions and in-store EMI schemes require credit cards and offer only limited options in terms of inventory .Finomena , a startup with a unique system of verification and loan approval, offers an alternative. It is a customer-experience driven fintech platform that enables inclusion by offering easy access to credit for people who have never taken a loan before, and hence do not have a credit score .Moreover, it allows you to register online and simply browse ecommerce sites and choose the gadget you want.After that you can choose from the financing and EMI options and apply with a single click.The phrase 'financial inclusion' evokes the idea of a section of people without access to basic banking services. This is why one of the government's primary initiatives in facilitating financial inclusion has been to open bank accounts through the Jan Dhan Yojana . However, a bank account alone does not ensure access to credit. A section that gets largely left out in terms of access to loans and credit cards, despite holding bank accounts, includes students, young professionals and the self-employed.More than 75% of Indians do not have a traditional credit bureau score.""We cannot rely too much on traditional models to gauge the credit score of a potential client as traditional data for these people doesn't exist.They might not have traditional income proof but with the power of a smartphone, they are leaving a massive digital footprint,"" says Abhishek Garg, cofounder, Finomena. The platform uses this big data to create machine learning-based risk and credit scoring systems that take into account over 20,000 data points to assess the credit worthiness of a borrower.Shashank Singh, 26, may be a lawyer at the Delhi High Court, but securing a loan from a bank was nearly impossible. ""As an advocate, my income fluctuates month to month , which is why banks are reluctant to issue credit cards to me or approve my loan applications,"" he says. When he wanted to purchase an iPhone 6S, Singh approached several banks for a loan, but was turned down each time. He started looking for alternatives and chanced upon Finomena. ""They had a one-on-one conversation with me about their processes, and sent someone to pick up the documents from my home. My loan was approved within a day,"" says Singh.A credit score is a three digit numeric summary of your entire credit history. It is prepared based on the information provided in your Credit Information Report. The credit score normally ranges between 300 and 900.Most banks and financial institutions rely on this figure to determine the credit worthiness of potential bor rowers. In fact, 79% of the loans approved are for individuals with a score over 750.However, this is a setback for the young unbanked population since they may not have a credit score at all, resulting in a vicious cycle.Finomena's founders, Riddhi Mittal and Abhishek Garg, did extensive research about loan disbursal mechanisms and the demographic of borrowers, which revealed that most banks and NBFCs steer clear of the students and young professionals because traditional modes of KYC data collection don't work for them. “Most of our customers are in their first jobs, or self-employed with no traditional proof,“ says Mittal.While there are a few options available to customers for buying high-end gadgets on an EMI basis, they often have hidden clauses. In-store EMI programmes require the customer to have a credit card. However, less than 2% Indians are credit card holders.These schemes also have set tenures and EMI amounts payable by the customer. Finomena has taken it one step further by introducing FMIs or flexible monthly installments.Viren Makwana, an IT student who also has a part-time job, was pleasantly surprised to learn that he could choose the down-payment amount, as well as how much he wanted to pay each month for buying a laptop.The 21-year-old settled for a monthly payment of Rs 2,000 to pay off the loan over a 12-month period.""Initially I didn't believe that online EMIs were possible, but once I spoke to a Finomena representative, I was reassured that the process would work,"" he says.","Financial technology startup Finomena lets you buy high-end products and devices through EMIs without a credit score.

The Tribune,12/21/0008,CPM ready to forge third alternative,"Keen to form the third alternative, the CPM appears to be proceeding cautiously. The party is clear that such an alternative should be a firm alliance based on shared policies and programmes that are different from both BJP and the Congress and not an arrangement aimed only at fighting elections.
 
 The draft political resolution released by the CPM today, which will be debated by party units and members before its adoption by the party congress being held at Coimbatore from March 29 to April 3, said there had to be an alternative to the Congress and the BJP-led combinations and the Left must take an initiative for it.
 
 “It is necessary to forge a third alternative. Such a platform must be based on a consistent anti-communal outlook, address the problems faced by the people and advocate pro-people economic measures. It should make provisions for social welfare and strengthening public distribution system, defence of national sovereignty and an independent foreign policy,” CPM general secretary Prakash Karat said.
 
 He said the party would maintain relations with all non-Congress secular parties for forging joint action on issues of common concern and strengthen Left unity to facilitate formation of the third alternative.
 
 Answering queries, Karat said he was not using the word third front as it was closely identified with the polls. He said the party had electoral understanding with parties such as the DMK, the RJD and the Samajwadi Party in the Lok Sabha polls and these were likely to continue.
 
 Differentiating between the BJP and the Congress, the resolution said the CPM would continue to adopt tactics for isolating and defeating the former while it would not enter into any alliance or united front with the latter.
 
 The resolution termed the Congress as secular bourgeois party, adding that the party often vacillates when the communal forces take the offensive.
 
 Karat said the Left had exerted pressure on the UPA government to fulfil the commitments made in the common minimum programme. He said some of the retrograde policies and legislations had been checked because these could not be passed without the support of the Left in Parliament.
 
 Hitting out at the BJP, he said after its defeat in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections the saffron party fell back on its hardcore Hindutva platform.
 
 “The role of the RSS in the running of the party is reinforced. In the BJP-ruled states the communal situation has deteriorated. Attacks on minorities, both Muslims and Christians, have taken place in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka and Orissa. The performance of the BJP-led state governments underline the fact that it is the most reactionary force in Indian politics,” he said.
 
 On the Indo-US nuclear deal, Karat said it was not going forward anywhere and the government would come back to the UPA-Left committee with its discussions with the IAEA on safeguards.
 
 Opposing hike in prices of petroleum products, he said the government would face protest from the Left if it went ahead with such a decision.
 
 “They should rationalise the tax structure rather than passing on the burden on the common man, who is already reeling under growing price of essential commodities,” he said.
 
 Accusing the UPA government of failing to tackle agrarian crisis, the resolution said reduction of subsidies and closure of indigenous fertiliser plants resulting in the import of urea at higher prices that has burdened the farmers further.
 
 Expressing concern on policies concerning food security, the resolution said the government was relying on import of wheat from abroad for the past two years at prices significantly higher than the minimum support price and targeted PDS system had failed to achieve results as BPL beneficiaries are being restricted on the basis of unreasonable criteria.
 
 On Centre-state relations, it said: “The party will take the initiative to raise issues of Centre-State relations and rally support of the people against the growing encroachment from the Centre.”
 
 On Jammu and Kashmir, the resolution reiterated that a political solution was possible only by assuring the Kashmiri people that their identity and culture will be fully safeguarded.","CPM's draft political resolution outlines the party's aim to create a third alternative in Indian politics. They envision this alternative as a solid alliance based on distinct policies and programs, separate from both the BJP and Congress, and not just a strategy for elections. The CPM's general secretary, Prakash Karat, emphasized the need for this alternative to have a consistent anti-communal stance, address people's problems, advocate pro-people economic measures, and support social welfare and public distribution systems, national sovereignty, and independent foreign policies. While the party maintains relations with non-Congress secular parties for joint action on common concerns, they make a clear distinction between the BJP and Congress, aiming to isolate the former and avoiding alliances with the latter. The resolution also touches on issues like the Indo-US nuclear deal, petroleum product price hikes, agrarian crises, food security, Centre-state relations, and Kashmir.",Miscellaneous,142,677

Customer concentration risk is evident, with a substantial portion of revenue dependent on a few top customers, primarily in the commercial vehicles, farm equipment, and off-highway vehicles sectors. Lack of definitive commitment agreements with customers poses a potential threat to business stability. Supplier concentration risk is notable, particularly in the reliance on a limited number of steel suppliers. Additionally, the absence of clear supply agreements for steel exposes the company to interruptions in the supply chain. Significant power and fuel requirements, coupled with potential disruptions, could adversely affect operations. Product concentration risk arises from a significant portion of revenue linked to specific products like crankshafts.

Goa Chronicle,12/22/0023,SpaceX’s unmanned Dragon spacecraft undocks from ISS,"Washington: NASA said Thursday that SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft has successfully undocked from the International Space Station (ISS) after multiple delays caused by unfavorable weather conditions and is expected to down off the coast of Florida.

“Undocking confirmed! @SpaceX’s CRS-29 Dragon is currently en route to Earth, set to splash down off the coast of Florida,” NASA said on X, formerly known as Twitter.

The spacecraft is carrying about 4,400 pounds of “precious scientific cargo” back to Earth, “including data assessing how cells respond to gravity, plants’ genetic adaptations in space, and more,” the space agency added.

The spacecraft is expected to land off the coast of Florida on Friday morning, NASA said.

Northrop Grumman’s uncrewed Cygnus spacecraft is also expected to depart the ISS on Friday around 7:45 a.m. EST (10:05 GMT). Unlike the Dragon spacecraft, Cygnus will safely burn up in Earth’s atmosphere, according to NASA.

The 29th SpaceX resupply mission to the ISS docked the station on November 11 and brought 65,00 pounds of cargo, including new science investigations to study atmospheric gravity waves and test high data rate laser communications from the space station to Earth, as well as provisions for the crew.

The company had said in September it had received permission to delay filing its annual accounts for a second year
running. The auditor's report published on Friday said that it had been able to obtain sufficient evidence for 2022's
figures.
A Revolut spokesperson said the fall in net profit was due to re-investing back into the business. Revolut said it had
increased spending on new product launches and global expansion, as well as doubling its headcount.
Staff costs jumped, and spending on advertising and marketing more than doubled, the report said.
Revolut said income from interest on assets grew to 83 million pounds in 2022, up around 4,700% from just 1.7 million
pounds in 2021.
Gerhard Kling, chair in finance at the University of Aberdeen, said the revenue was driven by the increase in net interest
income, due to central banks having raised interest rates in 2022.
""This is not a big surprise because interest rates went up, so all the banks will benefit from that and their net interest
margins will improve,"" Kling said.
Revolut made its first full-year profit in 2021, of 26 million pounds, helped by a boom in cryptocurrency trading. But retail
investing in crypto and equity markets dropped ""significantly"" in 2022, interim CFO Victor Stinga said in Friday's report.
Revolut CFO Mikko Salovaara left the company in May.
The company's 2021 accounts were also delayed and when they were finally published in March 2023, the auditor BDO
LLP said at the time it was not able to independently verify three-quarters of the 636 million pounds of revenue. The
warning drew scrutiny from regulators.
Revolut said its application for a UK banking licence ""remains ongoing"", but gave no further details. The company had
said in March it was ""in the advanced stages"" of the application.
The company's 2022 accounts included a number of revisions to figures in the 2021 accounts. For example, 2021's average
monthly number of employees was revised to 2,365 from 4,655.
In the report, Revolut said that the changes were made ""to align with presentation standards for the current year"" and
had no impact on net profit for the year.","Fintech company Revolut reported a record revenue of £923 million ($1.1 billion) for 2022, driven by interest income growth. However, net profit experienced a sharp decline, falling to £6 million. The delayed annual accounts also revealed increased spending on new product launches, global expansion, and a doubling of the company's headcount. The surge in staff costs, along with a significant rise in advertising and marketing expenditure, contributed to the decrease in net profit. The company highlighted its reinvestment in the business as the reason for the profit decline. Revolut's application for a UK banking license is still pending approval.",Business and Finance,99,504
THE ECONOMIC TIMES,12/22/0023,Micron shares jump 7% on forecast for quicker recovery in chip demand,"Chipmaker Micron Technology's shares jumped
7% on Thursday after it predicted a strong recovery
in the supply-demand balance for memory and
flash storage in 2024.
The company's quarterly results on Wednesday
exceeded market expectations and it forecast a
strong February quarter in a clear sign that memory chip prices will improve
next year to recover from a months-long downturn.
Its shares rose as much as $85.99 on Thursday to a near 21-month high. They
have gained roughly 60% this year in anticipation of an industry recovery.
Stock is either at or near normal levels for most of its customers across
personal computer, mobile, automotive and industrial markets, Micron said,
while data center inventories will approach those levels in the first half of
2024.
""Market rebounds are happening earlier than we previously thought,""
Morningstar analysts said.
Micron's upbeat results for the quarter ended Nov. 30 as well as its forecast
raised similar expectations from other chip companies that would report early
next year, lifting their shares.
The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index rose 2%, driven by gains in shares of
companies such as Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Qualcomm, Intel and
Broadcom.
Micron also said it was in ""the final stages"" to qualify its high-bandwidth
memory chips for use in Nvidia's most powerful AI platforms.
Such high-end memory chips are among Micron's most profitable products
and will draw in ""several hundred million"" dollars in revenue in fiscal 2024,
the company said.
Analysts expect AI-fueled demand to help Micron's rebound.
Rising demand for such chips is ""likely to be a tailwind for MU (Micron) for at
least the next 2 quarters and likely longer"", Piper Sandler analysts wrote in a
note. At least 12 brokerages raised their price targets after results, LSEG data
showed. Micron's forward price-to-earnings ratio is 32.45 for the next 12
months, compared with the industry's 21.03.","Micron Technology's shares surged 7% after forecasting a robust recovery in memory chip supply-demand balance for 2024.

The sources said the plan to revive terrorist activities in the area is part of a greater game plan by Pakistan and China to pressurise the Indian Army to remove troops from the Ladakh sector and redeploy forces in this area.
“There is a larger game plan by the Pakistan-China nexus to not allow India to ease out of the Jammu and Kashmir sector and deploy troops on the China border, especially in the Ladakh sector, where the PLA and Indian forces have been in a standoff for the last three years now,” they said.

India moved the Uniform Force of Rashtriya Rifles from the Poonch sector to Ladakh to counter Chinese aggression in 2020 as part of rebalancing and put pressure on the PLA to match Indian strength.

Sources said that around 25-30 Pakistani terrorists have been hiding in the upper reaches of the Poonch Rajouri sector in a forested area to launch attacks on security forces.
Over the last years since the Uniform Force left for Ladakh operations, Pakistan has started sending its own terrorists from Pakistan to the area to carry out attacks against Indian troops in an attempt to force India to redeploy its own troops in the area.
The Indian Army had recently moved in one more brigade to counter terrorist activities and has achieved success in the area.

Earlier on Thursday evening, four Army personnel were killed while three others were injured in the forest area of Dera ki Gali in the Rajouri district after two Army vehicles were ambushed by heavily armed terrorists.
The terrorists ambushed two Army vehicles carrying troops in Thanamandi, Rajouri.","

Dunki clashed with Salaar (December 22) at the box office and despite having a day extra as compared to the Prabhas-starrer, the latter has emerged to be the clear winner as it opened with a staggering Rs 95 crore.

Dunki opened with mixed reviews at the box office, with several people being of the opinion that the film fell flat when it came to screenplay and it was not Hirani's best work, given that he has a slate of films like 3 Idiots and Munna Bhai MBBS.


Ahead of Dunki's release, SRK had stated that the film was a tale of friendships and homecoming, and while he did Pathaan and Jawan for his fans, he did Dunki primarily for himself. The film highlights the issue of 'donkey flights', a term used for illegal immigration of Indians to the United Kingdom to earn a livelihood.

The Times of India,12/24/0005,Osama not here: Top Pak General,"A Pakistani general who led the hunt for terrorists in tribal areas bordering Afghanistan where Osama Bin Laden was believed to have been hiding now insists that the Al-Qaida leader is not there.

""This impression that the Pakistani tribal areas are havens for terrorists is baseless,"" said Lieutenant-General Ali Mohammad Jan Aurakzai, who commanded troops there from 2001 until his retirement last year.

""In all my years of command I never got a single indication that Bin Laden was on our side of the border. He''s a big guy, hard to hide and with 74,000 of my troops there it would have been very difficult for him to be hiding.""

American officials have repeatedly cited the hostile tribal areas as the most likely hideout for Bin Laden and said he has been helped by a network of tribesmen. Some have even indicated that officials from Pakistan''s military intelligence might be tipping him off about operations.

""This is nothing but conjecture based on their lack of information,"" said Aurakzai, who claimed that not a single Arab had been sighted in the tribal areas. He hit back at American criticism that Pakistan''s failure to seal its side of the border during fighting at Tora Bora allowed many Al-Qaida members, possibly including Bin Laden, to flee.

Speaking for the first time about what has been Pakistan''s most costly military operation in recent years, with 221 soldiers killed and 482 wounded, Aurakzai said he was summoned by Pakistan''s military leader, General Pervez Musharraf, on October 8, 2001, the day after the Americans started bombing the Taliban. His instructions were to send troops to the tribal areas to catch terrorists fleeing Afghanistan.

The Pakistani army had never entered these areas of rugged mountains that are inhabited by fierce tribes.

""But the Americans had said if we wouldn''t do it, they would,"" the Lieutenant-General said.

Ever since Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s Animal released on December 1, the film has been dissected by critics, fans, in interviews and more. So much so, that the conversation still hasn’t died down, even 26 days after the film’s release. Sandeep’s brother Pranay, who’s also the producer, talked about the film in an interview with iDream Media. He addressed some of the criticism they’ve faced since the film’s release. (Also Read: Sandeep Reddy Vanga reveals Ranbir didn't want ‘superstar’ tag in Animal teaser, was told 'They do it in the South')

‘There’s no ill intent’
Ranbir Kapoor plays Ranvijay Singh in the film and the antagonist, Bobby Deol, plays a character called Abrar. “When Sandeep told me the villain will have three wives and eight kids, I knew it’s something people would talk about. I was right,” says Pranay in the interview. However, he claims that there was no ill intent behind making the villain belong to a particular community. “Some complained that we didn’t show the community in a good light. In the last three decades, we have seen numerous villains wearing a bottu (bindi/tilak). Nobody complained. Just because it’s a minority now, people are nitpicking,” he adds.

‘Sandeep is not calculative’
The interviewer asks if Sandeep is calculative when he shows violence or gives his female actors less screen space. Pranay disagrees with her and says, “I think Rashmika’s character Geetanjali is as important as RK (Ranbir Kapoor) and Bobby’s. RK hardly has four lines in a four-page-long Karva Chauth scene. RK also told Rashmika that this is her scene. He even told her she can hit him multiple times to get her scene right.” In fact, the producer reveals that Ranbir was hit at least 20-25 times before they got the shot right. “RK is not insecure. He wanted the scene to work well emotionally,” he adds.

About Animal
Animal stars Ranbir, Rashmika, Bobby and Anil Kapoor in the lead roles. The film also sees Triptii Dimri in a key role and her performance was widely praised. The film tells the story of a man looking for validation from his emotionally distant father.

FINANCIAL EXPRESS,12/27/0014,"India crash-test standards: Car safety, design to get priority under new body","Carmakers in India would be forced to recalibrate their focus on safety, with the Vehicle Regulation and Road Safety Authority of India ? an independent agency proposed in the draft Road Transport and Safety Bill ? expected to wield the stick on issues such as standards for the design and construction of passenger cars.

Also, from next year, the Bharat New Vehicle Safety Assessment Program is expected to be rolled out, under which the safety of passengers would be assessed by testing cars in front-on and side-on crashes.

India currently does not have a new car assessment programme to provide buyers with independent reports of vehicles? crash safety and vehicle makers are not required to meet the United Nation?s basic crash-test standards, something that is mandatory in markets across the world.



The two measures assume significance in light of a random crash test conducted by an independent agency in January this year, where three cars out of the five cars failed the front impact crash tests on account of basic structural deficiencies in the body.

This is even as a variant of one of these car models that is sold in the European market was found to be carrying the highest rating safety certification offered by the same agency in similar crash tests conducted on cars sold in the European Union.

In January 2014, the UK-based Global NCAP (New Car Assessment Programme) had tested five of India?s bestselling compact cars for their safety features.

The Hyundai i10, along with Maruti Suzuki Alto 800 and Tata Nano, were found to have ?inadequate vehicle structures that collapsed to varying degrees?, resulting in high risks of life-threatening injuries to the occupants.

Hyundai?s i10 had a five-star NCAP certification in the UK (this car has now been replaced with the Grand i10 in Europe).

The Ford Figo and Volkswagen Polo also received zero points for adult protection ratings in a frontal impact at 64 km/hour.

NCAP, however, noted that these two cars had structures that remained ?stable? and, therefore, with airbags fitted, protection for the driver and front passenger would be ?much improved?.

The explanation offered by carmakers for going easy on safety is that norms prescribed in the country do not stipulate airbags or specific standards on reinforcement of vehicle structures, as opposed to the stringent norms followed in markets such as the US, EU or even ASEAN.

?Hyundai vehicles are designed and built to meet all the prescribed safety standards set by Indian Regulatory Authorities,? the company had said an email in response to a query on the safety issue.

A Volkswagen spokesperson said its cars made in India at its Chakan facility are ?identical in build quality? and structural integrity parameters in comparison to cars rolling out of its other facilities across the world.

The Global NCAP tests were carried out on the entry-level versions of these five car models, which did not have air bags.

The powers for the Vehicle Regulation and Road Safety Authority of India to specify safety standard for vehicle makers, as proposed in the draft Road Transport and Safety Bill, is alongside powers to recall motor vehicles in case of any deviation from norms.

This includes the authority ot act on complaints by 100 or more people reporting a defect in a particular model of a vehicle to the authority or if a model does not comply with the provisions and standards prescribed under the Act.

The procedure for recall will be laid out by regulations by the Centre. For faulty manufacturing design, a fine of Rs 5 lakh a vehicle, along with imprisonment, has been proposed.

* The measures assume significance in light of a random crash test conducted in January this year, where several cars sold in India had structural deficiencies

","India is set to prioritize automotive safety with the introduction of new regulations and initiatives. The proposed Vehicle Regulation and Road Safety Authority of India, outlined in the draft Road Transport and Safety Bill, will enforce standards for passenger car design and construction. Additionally, the Bharat New Vehicle Safety Assessment Program, scheduled for launch next year, will evaluate car safety through crash testing. Currently, India lacks a comprehensive car assessment program, leading to concerns about vehicle safety standards. A significant impetus for these measures came from a random crash test conducted earlier, revealing structural deficiencies in popular compact car models. This highlights the need for stringent safety regulations and independent assessment programs, especially considering the discrepancy between safety standards in India and other global markets. The proposed authority will have the power to specify safety standards, conduct recalls for non-compliance, and impose fines and penalties for faulty manufacturing designs, signaling a significant shift towards prioritizing automotive safety in India",Automotive,159,667
The Arunachal Times,12/27/0223,IAF’s combat capabilities should not be compromised,"The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Defence expressing concern over the delay in the supply of light combat aircraft by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited to the Indian Air Force (IAF) is a matter of deep concern. This report comes at a time when India is experiencing extreme hostility from China and Pakistan. Self-reliance in the defence sector is a lofty goal, but excessive dependence on the public sector companies to meet the objectives of indigenisation could become a stumbling block. There is a need to strike a balance between promoting self-reliance in defence production and the requirements of the armed forces to ensure preparedness as the country faces a two-front threat from Pakistan and China. 
The standing committee in its report tabled in Parliament recently recommended that the government consider buying fifth-generation fighter aircraft ‘over the counter’, without losing further time, to keep the force in a comfortable position. This is a poor commentary on the capabilities of the HAL in meeting the timelines. It was in April 2019 that the IAF had initiated the process to acquire 114 multi-role fighter aircraft from the public sector unit at a cost of around $18 billion. There has been no progress since then. There can be no two opinions about the fact that the defence forces must be kept in a perpetual state of combat readiness, since the country is wedged between two hostile neighbours. Airpower has a key role to play in this regard, even as the IAF currently has 31 fighter aircraft squadrons against the authorised strength of 42. Fast-tracking of procurements is a must to ensure that the IAF’s fighting capabilities are not compromised.","The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Defence has expressed concern over the delay in the supply of light combat aircraft by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) to the Indian Air Force (IAF).

the mint,12/28/0015,Investing lessons from 2015,"In his book Black Box Thinking, author Matthew Syed highlights the divergent approach to failures in the two most safety-critical industries in the world, namely aviation and healthcare. In the airline industry, the process of evaluating failure is institutionalized. Every aircraft is equipped with two almost-indestructible black boxes—one records instructions sent to the onboard electronic system and the other records the conversations and sounds in the cockpit. By systematically learning from failures and working to make improvements, the aviation industry has attained an impressive safety record. In 2013, the accident rate in the aviation industry was one per 2.4 million flights. In contrast, Lucian Leape, a Harvard University professor, estimated that a million patients are injured by errors in hospital treatment and that 120,000 die each year in the US alone. It is believed that preventable medical error in hospitals is the third biggest killer in the US, behind only heart disease and cancer.While having such institutionalized processes is a big advantage, the gains need not be restricted to just failure mitigation. Having a log of what goes on in the cockpit also enables operational improvements and better productivity, all leading to superior outcomes. How we wish that as institutional investors we had a black box that recorded our thoughts and actions while running our portfolios, but short of that, we have to make do with a periodic, reflective look back at the time that went by.In that spirit of spotting mistakes, improving processes and hoping to become better portfolio helmsmen, we conduct our annual exercise of looking back at what Mr Market dealt us in the year gone by and as always, stay away from the tribe of crystal-ball gazers attempting to make predictions for 2016.1) A bad year for investingThe year 2015 was unequivocally a bad year for almost all asset classes. To borrow a phrase from Bill Gross, investors have been crying in their beers in 2015. Barring a long US dollar trade in the currency markets, most other assets from oil, gold and commodities to bonds and equities performed poorly, even more so when measured in US dollars. That the best-performing large equity market for the year was Japan, with a paltry dollar return of 3.4%, tells the story. Once in a while, Mr Market will hand a D grade to every pupil in the class.2) The party was behind closed doorsThough there was no samba on the streets for the public market investor, behind closed doors of the private equity club, the party was roaring. As per a Goldman Sachs report, in the US as of September 2015, more than 120 companies were valued at more than $1 billion in the private market , up from just 43 at the beginning of 2014.These trends were mimicked in India as well. The best performing company in 2015 in India might well have been Flipkart with its valuation going up in every successive round of funding, from $1.6 billion in early 2014 to currently about $15 billion. Liquidity can find its way into unexpected places.3) Fixed deposit is also an asset classFor only the third time in the past 15 years, the bank fixed deposit was the best performing asset in India, out-performing equities, gold and property. After returning 32% in 2014, equities  were down to -6.4% in 2015. At the same time last year, expectations were running high for a strong performance for equities in 2015 on hopes of a reform-oriented government and a V-shaped cyclical recovery in the economy. At the beginning of the year, very few would have given fixed deposits even an outside chance of being the best performing asset for the year. The importance of disciplined asset allocation for retail investors to maintain a balance between equities and fixed return instruments was reinforced.4) Think stocks, not sectorsIn 2015, sector selection did not matter much. Compared to the past few years, inter-sectoral performance deviation was much lower. Investor commentaries often focus on how sector allocation hurt or help in overall performance. But for an investor, the basic unit of thinking should be an individual stock.5) Look out for change in the ‘beholders’Of the three calendar years with negative returns in the past decade, 2015 has been the only one where in a falling market, mid-cap stocks have outperformed the large caps . Conventional wisdom suggests that in years of negative returns, mid-caps underperform large-cap stocks owing to higher pressure on earnings and lower liquidity in the markets.In our June 2013 essay titled “Beauty and the equities market"", we had highlighted how a few stocks had disproportionately contributed to market performance since the year 2008, driven both by superior earnings growth and a significant re-rating. These market darlings had seen continued buying from foreign investors. In 2015, we saw some reversal in the fortunes of these companies led by fundamental reasons combined with the fact that the “beholders"" in the markets were changing. Net foreign buying in equities at $2.7 billion was far lower than net domestic institution buying at $9.7 billion. When the beholders change, the idea of beauty changes as well.6) Good macro does not equal good marketsThe year 2015 stands in sharp contrast to 2012. The former was a good year for macro, as measured by the four key parameters of GDP growth, inflation, current account deficit and fiscal deficit. But this did not translate into spectacular returns for the stock markets. In comparison, almost nothing went right on the macro front in 2012, but it marked a great year with the markets returning 30%. The Reserve Bank of India cut rates by 125 basis points during the year, yet the yield on benchmark 10-year government securities, which was at 7.86% as at end 2014, was hardly changed at 7.79% as we write this. In the short term, macroeconomic fundamentals may not have a positive correlation with market returns.7) The effects of being in a bad neighbourhoodEmerging markets  had another bad year, which compounded the fact that trailing returns for the EM index on a three- and five-year basis are now negative. While all commentators expected India to stand out, it hasn’t been easy at all. Despite the fact that India is a good house, there was no denying that it was in a bad neighbourhood and, in the short term, it is the perception of the neighbourhood that dominated in determining returns.8) Evidence triumphs hopeEquity investors take pride in buying ahead of a turn in the indicators that are relevant for a particular stock. Making bets ahead of a budget while attempting to forecast tax rate changes, or buying stocks in the hope of a rural India pickup, or in the hope of a capital spending turnaround, or an asset quality improvement for banks has simply not worked in 2015. In contrast, if one had picked up stocks based on ground realities, or what we call evidence, the returns would have been much better. Beware of storytelling; keep your nose buried in evidence.9) Patience is a virtueIn April 2013  we had highlighted that oil prices could fall owing to technological advances and new sources of oil. We had called cheaper fuel as India’s stealth game-changer. It took almost 15 months for our thesis to play out when oil decisively cracked in June 2014. Today, oil prices are at one-third of the peak in 2014. The lesson learnt here is that when it comes to macro trades, patience is a virtue.If you believe in the fundamentals behind a macro call, it is very likely that prices do not follow the expected pattern for a long period of time, but when it does play out, it could be swift and steep. Such was the case with oil that it diverged from other commodities like coal, iron ore and steel as it stayed higher for longer, but eventually caught up.10) Post-facto narrative fallacyEvery year, the markets are caught up in the narrative fallacy surrounding hyped-up events. The lift-off by the US Federal Reserve was one such event. Closer home, the actions of the Narendra Modi government have been seen by supporters and critics very differently, a point we highlighted in our essay  on the dangers of the echo chamber. The story on oil is playing out quite similarly. Most analysts are highlighting why oil prices should head even lower, the typical reasons being glut of supply and weak economic growth. We wouldn’t be surprised—if oil prices had remained at elevated levels, the same analysts would have been talking about the tensions in Syria and other parts of West Asia, and pressures on the fiscal balances in Russia, or the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ’s cartelization to justify higher oil prices. Finding a story to fit the facts is an engaging but useless pastime.At the risk of sounding like a broken record, we think India is on a path for gradual and uneven recovery and just because a calendar year has changed does not mean that reality will change. One’s investing style should remain the same in that one should look for growth inflections that seem durable and look for high-quality stocks within those spaces. This isn’t about finding the next big macro trade, but as Peter Lynch neatly summarized, “The person that turns over the most rocks is going to win the game.""Amay Hattangadi and Swanand Kelkar work with Morgan Stanley Investment Management. 
","The year 2015 witnessed a challenging investment landscape, with most asset classes performing poorly. The aviation industry's systematic approach to failure analysis, exemplified by black boxes, has led to impressive safety records, while preventable medical errors remain a significant issue in healthcare. The private equity sector saw significant growth, while fixed deposits outperformed equities in India. Sector selection had a lesser impact on performance compared to individual stock selection. Changing market dynamics affected the performance of mid-cap and large-cap stocks. The correlation between macroeconomic fundamentals and market returns was not evident, highlighting the short-term unpredictability of markets. Emerging markets faced difficulties, with India being affected by its association with these markets. Evidence-based investing outperformed hope-driven bets. Patience and conviction in macro trades proved valuable, as exemplified by the eventual decline in oil prices. Markets often fall prey to narrative fallacies surrounding hyped-up events, and investors should be cautious of finding stories to fit facts. A gradual and uneven recovery is expected in India, and investors should focus on durable growth inflections and high-quality stocks rather than chasing the next big macro trade.

The Hindu,12/3/0023,Cops Seek info n PGs from New Town RWAs,"Kolkata: Bidhannagar Police has started asking residents' welfare associations in New Town to identify flats that have been converted into paying guest accommodations. They plan to make a database of outsiders staying as paying guests in the complexes. The cops are also asking owners to maintain a list of documents from the paying guests and provide them if necessary.

The order came from the police commissioner's office following multiple instances of crime involving paying guests surfaced in the township be it their involvement in fake call centres or some other crimes.
In October, a 21-year-old MBBS aspirant, preparing for NEET while staying as a paying guest in the city, was drugged and killed by a friend who had met him at the PG accommodation as he abducted him seeing his I-phone and flashy lifestyle, hoping to get a good ransom from his family in Malda. Multiple fake call centre executives who had been putting up as PG inside gated communities and were committing crime from their homes were also arrested earlier this year.

""We are trying to prepare a fresh database of paying guests living in the Bidhannagar commissionerate jurisdiction for better clarity of outsiders living here. We are not against flat owners keeping paying guests at their flats. We just want them to maintain proper documentation and want the RWAs to have a list of flats that are operating as PG accommodations,"" said a senior officer of Bidhannagar City Police.
New Town complexes has a large population of paying guests, courtesy the presence of a number of universities and workplaces in the township.

According to the rules, the moment the number of boarders crosses five, a flat or a house is considered a guest house, for which a trade licence is required and New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) charges a fee of Rs 1,250 per year for them. The owners also inform local police about occupants and also provide verification documents of boarders. However, officials said, a majority of owners are either unaware of the rule or simply do not comply.

NKDA, on its part, is also conducting a survey across New Town to check and identify whether any residential household is utilising the building for commercial use. ""There are certain rules to be followed and a fee to be paid if a residential building is being used as a commercial space,"" said an NKDA official.

In March last year, Bidhannagar cops had undertaken a similar measure asking RWAs to maintain a database of tenants in their complexes. ""We have already prepared a database of tenants and have handed them over to the cops. If needed, we will prepare a database for PGs as well,"" said Dibyendu Roy of Akankha housing complex in Action Area II.
","Bidhannagar Police in Kolkata has directed Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) to identify flats used as paying guest accommodations in New Town, aiming to create a database of outsiders residing there. This follows instances of crimes involving paying guests, emphasizing the need for proper documentation and RWA records for such accommodations.

The pioneer,12/31/0019,Centre to provide banking outlet at every five km,"On the advice of the Union Government, the State Government has started making assessment on requirement of banks at the gram panchayat level.

Sources said the Government has asked the district Collectors to make assessments and submit reports in pursuance to a proposal of the Department of Financial Services (DoFS) of the Union Government.

While 4,900 GPs of the State have no banks, the Government has requested the Union Government often for setting up of branches of nationlised commercial banks in unbanked areas.

In a recent decision, the Department of Financial Services of the Ministry of Finance has decided to set up a banking outlet within five kilometer distance of every inhabited village in the country. Banking outlets include bank branches, business correspondent, India Post Payment Bank Centres etc.

The DoFS has joined hands with National Informatics Centre (NIC) and launched the Jan Dhan /Darshak Application on which over 6 lakh banking outlets have been mapped through Geographic Information System (GIS), which is a major technical tool that can monitor the coverage of banking infrastructure in villages.

Banks are regularly mapping and updating the details of newly opened banking outlets on Jan Dhan Darshak App, which is an ongoing exercise.

District Collectors will identify the villages, which are not covered by any of banking outlets within a distance of 5 km.

These proposals would be discussed in District Level Review Committees (DLRC) and the State Level Bankers Committee (SLBC) and thereafter it would be intimated to DoFS, said an official.

Recently when DoFS Special Secretary Debashish Panda visited the State, he was appraised by Fianance Principal Secretary Ashok Kumar Meena about the requirement of banking services in the State. Meena requested the Union Government for establishment of brick and mortar branches in maximum places.

For making payment to beneficiaries under various social security schemes through DBT (direct benefit transfer), financial inclusion is most important, said an officer.

Previously, many areas were remote and inaccessible. In the last few years, the State Government has spent a good amount of money in improvement of roads, which is one of the criteria bank authorities consider while mulling to set up of bank branches. With good roads available, the Government has requested major banks for opening brick and mortar branches in all areas.","The State Government, on Union Government's advice, assesses banking needs at the gram panchayat level.

Ahead of the looming February 1 deadline for switchover to the new broadcasting regime, telecom regulator Trai has asked DTH operators to honour pre-paid commitment on ongoing long-duration packs, if customer wishes to continue with them.

The advisory being sent out to operators assumes significance as the deadline for migration to the new tariff regime for broadcasting and cable services is just hours away and there have been reports that some DTH players are nudging customers with long duration packs, to choose channels under the new framework, without offering them the option to continue with their plan.

Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) Chairman RS Sharma told PTI that there is no change in February 1 deadline for migration to the new tariff regime for broadcasting and cable services.

Sharma said he is “confident” of a smooth switchover on the stipulated day without any inconvenience to customers.

“Where customers have already exercised their choice and decided to move to the new framework, if they have long or short duration packs, it (the payment made) will get adjusted. In those cases where people have not yet migrated and they have a long or short duration plan already on, the regulation clearly states that customers have the choice to continue with it, till the plan expires,” Sharma said.","Ahead of the February 1 deadline for the new broadcasting regime, Trai has instructed DTH operators to honor pre-paid commitments for ongoing long-duration packs if customers wish to keep them.

Jharcraft was established in 2006 with the objective of boosting silk production and supporting sericulturists, weavers and artisans. The organization implemented government-funded schemes to promote tasar, handloom and handicrafts in the state.” 

“Jharcraft’s first emporium was launched in September 2007 at MG Road in Ranchi. There has been no looking back since. Silk production has jumped to 1,025 metric tonnes (MT) in 2012-13 from 90 MT in 2006. We are expecting the silk production to rise to 2600 MT this year,” he added.

Panda said that around 25,000 artisans are working with the corporation, under 25 designers.

The corporation is running its outlets both in Jharkhand as well as at national level. “In Jharkhand the outlets are in Dhanbad and Hazaribag and two more are coming up in Jamshedpur and Bokaro. This apart, Jharcraft has outlets in Delhi, Kolkata, Ahmadabad, Pune, Mumbai and Bengaluru,” he said.

the economic times,12/31/0023,There is merit in rationalizing the taxes but should it be done this year? Madhu Kela answers,"“Any meaningful distortion on the capital gains tax regime may not get a significant revenue boost up and it is not even needed if they get Rs 10,000 crore extra. This thing can wait and it should wait. There is merit in rationalizing the taxes but should it be done this year? That is my point,” says market expert Madhusudan Kela.

The government also is no longer doing a lot of wasteful expenditure of government tax collection in the form of subsidies or any other thing. kind of expenditure which is not creating wasteful effects so the multiplier is very large?
Exactly. This number used to be 10 or 12%, the capital expenditure number of the overall expenditure used to be 10 or 12% now it has inched up to 19 or 20% and that is what is getting reflected in the confidence of people when it comes to all the infrastructure projects being implemented and we are seeing it all around us.

Every time when the Budget is round the corner, we tend to discuss the importance of rationalization of taxes in India. We have different tenure and different tax rates. Different tenure depending on your holding in equity, debt, real estate and gold. Market nervousness is valid. The short term rates in India are 15% and long term is 10%. If the short term rate is changed in proportion with business income, will that be negative news for the market?
Let us first look at it from the finance minister’s situation. Capital markets have enabled raising of Rs 6.5 lakh crore of equity in the last 3 years. I would urge and pray that these things are not disturbed at least this year because everything is going well. The capital market is helping revive the economy given the global context.","Market expert Madhusudan Kela argues that significant changes to the capital gains tax regime are unnecessary this year, especially if the government gains an extra ₹10,000 crore. He notes that the rise in capital expenditure to 19-20% of overall spending is boosting confidence in infrastructure.

 The Pioneer,12/31/0202,Exciting little discovery,"It has become rather fashionable to blame former Finance Minister P Chidambaram for a lot of things. But one thing that those of us who write about cars can rightly accuse Chidambaram of is having inadvertently given birth to the Compact Sedan segment. By keeping cars below four metres in length in a lower excise category in a budget about a decade ago, Chidambaram thought he was promoting small hatchbacks. But Tata Motors developed the Indigo CS, a sedan with a boot that came in at under 4,000 millimetres in length, enough to get some excise benefits. This spurred several manufacturers to come up with something similar. Maruti Suzuki first made a sedan out of the Swift, the Dzire, and in the second-generation of the Dzire, it created what is by far one of the most successful cars ever made in India. The second-generation Dzire became the small taxi of choice across the length and breadth of the country. And other manufacturers cottoned onto this as well, which gave us the Hyundai Xcent, Honda Amaze and Ford Aspire.

But let me be honest, early design attempts at Compact Sedans were, well, pretty terrible. Designers stuck inside a tightly confined box, which just took a meat cleaver to the back-end of the car. Either that or they just added a little ‘third box’ to the hatchbacks, making you scratch your head when looking at the cars. To call them aesthetically pleasing would mean that one’s sense of aesthetics have gone awry. However, as they got more used to the restrictions and managed to work around the entire vehicle, they became better. The third-generation Dzire and second-generation Amaze along with the Tata Tiago and Ford Aspire are smart-looking cars. Yes, there is that sense that they’re trying to fit into a shirt, one size too small, but compared to previous iterations, they are clearly way better.

Then there is Hyundai and the new Aura. While I was never a fan of the original Santro’s look, and Hyundai has had some strange cars after that, I am looking at Eon as contemporary Hyundai cars are  extremely attractive. From the Venue to the Verna, the forthcoming Tucson and the third-generation i20, which will be showcased at the Auto Expo 2020, Hyundai’s design language has evolved to a nice place. My long-term car right now is the refreshed Hyundai Elantra as it stands out with its very sharp looks. But this is about the Aura, and I am afraid to say that the rear-end of the car is well, strange! I don’t understand the need for the blacked-out C-pillar and the reflector strip through the boot. While I would not be so extreme as to call this an aesthetic assault, let us just leave this here by saying that I am not a fan. Which is a pity because I really do like the i10 Nios hatchback that the Aura is based on.

But when you drive the Aura, specifically the one with 1.0 litre Turbo, you forget the way the car looks because it suddenly proves that Compact Sedans can move. Sure, there have been 100 horsepower compact sedans before but those have been diesel. And while I do not want to get into a debate on the merits of diesel and petrol right now, it suffices to say that petrol engines are more responsive that diesel ones. I have driven the Venue with the same turbo engine and just like in the Aura, Hyundai’s powertrain engineers have managed to work out the kinks leaving almost no perceptible turbo-lag.

This is a properly nice engine and when it is coupled to a car with great ride and superb handling, you forget about the rear-end. On the roads that lead to the Jam Gate outside Mhow, which is the entrance through the pass onto the fertile plains of Malwa, you begin to have some fun. And this was with three people and a lot of equipment in the car, which cannot be called a light load. It took all the corners with aplomb and while you do need to mash the gears in the lower end of the powerband, once you hit the sweet spot, it is a very rewarding powerband. Despite the ‘fun’, non-economical, I had driven the Aura, which still delivered a quite surprising 13 kilometres to the litre. The lightweight and good road handling qualities helped in delivering a decent fuel economy even when you want to have some fun.

Compact Sedans were born out of a lacunae in the rules. They have become a practical solution for those who wanted the convenience of a boot and there is a reason the taxi segment adopted it en masse. But Compact Sedans were never ‘fun’ and I never thought that I would see the day when I could describe one of them as fun. But the Aura Turbo is actually a fun car that is not just nice to drive but practical as well. And there are variants with a 1.2 BS6 diesel and a 1.2 BS6 petrol, which, though not as peppy as the turbo, share the great ride and handling characteristics. Having said that, the managing director of Hyundai India, SS Kim told me that almost a third of Venue sales have been of the car equipped with the same Turbo engine. We also know that Hyundai is fitting the same engine in the Nios and that the i20 could come up with an even more powerful power unit. And to deliver power and fun at a decent ex-showroom price — Rs 8.54 lakh — the Aura Turbo could be a game changer. Personally, I’d stick to a hatchback and can’t wait for the Turbo Nios.","
The text discusses the origin and evolution of the Compact Sedan segment in the Indian automotive market. It credits former Finance Minister P Chidambaram for inadvertently creating this segment by implementing excise benefits for cars under four meters in length. The text highlights the initial design challenges faced by manufacturers but acknowledges the improvement in aesthetics over time. It critiques the design of the Hyundai Aura but praises its performance, especially the 1.0 litre Turbo engine variant. Despite initial reservations about Compact Sedans being ""fun"" to drive, the author finds the Aura Turbo enjoyable and practical. The text concludes by discussing the potential impact of the Aura Turbo on the market and hints at future developments in the segment.

""I think it's a great day for India, it's a great day for humanity at large. Two vaccines have been approved under restricted use and emergency use authorisation and it has been done following discussions by SEC. This is wonderful news for India and all of us,"" Bhargava told ANI.

However, he said that it is unknown how long vaccine is going to be effective. ""We don't know how much of the population we'll have to vaccinate to break the virus transmission. What we know is that we've been able to control the pandemic in the country by following COVID-19 appropriate behaviour... I am of the opinion that masks will probably be the last to go and probably may never even go.""

Talking about the new variant of Crornavirus creating 'havoc' in the UK, the ICMR chief informed that scientists of the National Institute of Virology (NIV) have successfully isolated the new virus strain and it will be tested against different vaccines soon.

""New virus variant which is now more than 60 per cent infective and creating havoc in the UK, is worrisome. There are 29 patients in India with the same variant for which we should be cautious. We were able to isolate the new virus very early,"" he stated.

""NIV scientists have successfully isolated the new virus strain and this will be tested against different vaccines,"" he said and added that he hopes ""potentially Bharat Biotech vaccine will have some advantages over other vaccines on this new strain because it is a whole virus.""

ICMR on Saturday said India has successfully isolated and cultured the UK-variant of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 disease. It is to mention that no other country has yet reported successful isolation and culture of the UK-variant of SARS-CoV-2 and added that vero cell lines of the virus were used by the scientists of ICMR-NIV to culture the UK-variant of the virus.

COVID-19 vaccines of Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech have been granted permission for restricted use in an emergency situation, said Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) on Sunday.

Notably, COVAXIN is an indigenously developed coronavirus vaccine manufactured by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the ICMR.","Dr. Balram Bhargava, Director General of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), stated that masks may continue to be a regular part of life even after the COVID-19 vaccination drive. While expressing optimism about the approval of two vaccines in India, Bhargava highlighted the uncertainty regarding the duration of vaccine effectiveness and the need to vaccinate a significant portion of the population to break virus transmission. He suggested that masks might be the last COVID-19 precautionary measure to be discontinued and may even continue indefinitely.

Regarding the new variant of the virus causing concern in the UK, Bhargava mentioned that scientists at the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in India have successfully isolated the new strain. The isolated virus will be tested against different vaccines to assess their effectiveness. Bhargava expressed hope that Bharat Biotech's COVAXIN might have advantages against the new strain as it is a whole-virus vaccine.

In doing so, he surpassed early milestones set by Indian legends like Sachin Tendulkar and Yuvraj Singh.

Vaibhav scored 19 runs off 28 balls, hitting four boundaries against Mumbai’s strong bowling lineup. Unlike most cricketers his age who play in U-16 or U-19 formats, Vaibhav has leapfrogged into senior domestic cricket, making him a viral sensation in Indian sports circles.

He first rose to prominence in the Vinoo Mankad Trophy, scoring 393 runs in five innings at an average of 78.60.

The Orissa Post,12/9/0223,Over 2.43 lakh POCSO cases pending in fast-track courts till Jan 2023; 3% conviction rate in 2022: Report,"More than 2.43 lakh cases under the POCSO Act were pending in fast-track special courts (FTSCs) as of January 31 this year despite the central government’s robust policy and financial commitment, according to a research paper published by an NGO. In 2022, the number of such cases that resulted in conviction remained a mere three per cent nationally, it said. The research paper — ‘Justice Awaits: An Analysis of the Efficacy of Justice Delivery Mechanisms in Cases of Child Sexual Abuse in India’ – released by India Child Protection Fund (ICPF) said that even if no new cases are added to the list, the country will need at least nine years to clear this backlog. In some states such as Arunachal Pradesh and Bihar, it could take more than 25 years to bring the pending cases to closure. The findings of the paper cast a huge question mark on the efficacy of the country’s judicial system, despite the central government’s 2019 landmark decision to set up fast-track special courts to provide justice to child sexual abuse victims and despite the government pumping in crores of rupees every year to ensure justice for every child. The paper further states that given the present scenario, while Arunachal Pradesh would take 30 years to complete the trials of cases pending under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act as of January 2023, Delhi will take 27 years, West Bengal 25, Meghalaya 21, Bihar 26, and Uttar Pradesh 22 years to clear the backlog. The fast-track courts, set up in 2019, were supposed to deliver the legal mandate for the completion of trial of such cases within one year and yet out of the total 2,68,038 cases that were under trial, only 8,909 cases resulted in conviction. The central government recently approved the continuation of FTSCs as a centrally sponsored scheme till 2026 with a budgetary allocation of more than Rs1,900 crore. The study highlights that each FTSC in the country on average disposes just 28 cases per year, which means the expenditure in one conviction is around Rs9 lakh. The report is based on data from the Ministry of Law and Justice, Ministry of Women and Child Development and the National Crime Records Bureau. “Each FTSC was expected to dispose of 41-42 cases in a quarter and at least 165 in a year. The data suggests that FTSCs are unable to achieve the set targets even after three years of the launch of the scheme,” the paper stated. Citing the Supreme Court’s judgement, the report further said that child marriage is child rape and as per the Census of 2011, a staggering 4,442 minor girls were married every day, which means every minute, three children were pushed into child marriage. However, only three child marriages are reported every day, as per the latest National Crime Records Bureau data. Emphasizing that despite having a robust policy, strict laws and ample financial commitment, the minuscule rate of conviction is a matter of grave concern, ICPF founder Bhuwan Ribhu said, “The spirit of law needs to be translated into justice for every child There can be no legal deterrence when mere three per cent of the people accused of sexual offences against children are convicted.”","A research paper by India Child Protection Fund reveals over 2.43 lakh pending POCSO Act cases in fast-track courts as of January 2023, with only 3% resulting in convictions in 2022. Despite government efforts and funding, the backlog casts doubt on judicial efficacy, with some states facing over 25-year delays.",National News,50,541

The pioneer,1919-09-30 00:00:00,"Soon, Naga heritages to be lost forever","The open site of the Bada Akhada Mutt is a welcome sight for the  sore eyes of those who support the mutt demolishing being done in Puri.  As promised, the small temple, the Gadi of the Mahant, and the kitchen inside the mutt were left intact.

Mahant Harinarayan Das has been incommunicado since the demolition, a few of the initiates and disciples were wandering around with lost expressions.

I met Atmatatvananda, who told me that they had no option other than surrendering. The mutt will be allocated land elsewhere, he said, but the historic values, the chaitanya and the heritage is lost forever.

The Langali Mutt at Cuttack was one such place for the Naga Sadhus. It was built sometime in the 1870’s, on the embankment of the Kathjori, just off the Puri Ghat. Today, the only visible sign of the old mutt is a small arched entrance about 100 metres away from the Puri Ghat Police Station. 

The Nagas looked fierce and formidable with their ash-smeared body, long matted hair and intense eyes. The locals used to keep a safe distance, the Nagas had quick tempers and there were many cases of skirmishes. Their nudity, chillums and aggressive behaviour instilled fear and bewilderment among the people.

Another Naga mutt on the Old Jagannath Sadak was the Lacchman Mutt in Balakati on the banks of the Daya river, the remains of which can still be seen.

The Nagas were unwelcome in the mutts of Puri, so they left for the Rath Yatra just a couple of days earlier, to reach just in time.

The Nabakalebar of 1950 witnessed violent clashes between the Naga Sadhus and the police. In the struggle, 200 Sadhus and 14 policemen were injured. It is also believed that a dozen Nagas were killed; the bodies were removed and buried. In 1954, during the Rath Yatra, a wheel of Lord Jagannath’s chariot gave way, and the chariots were stranded midway.

The next day, a group of armed Nagas forcefully climbed the Chariot of Lord Balabhadra and attacked the policemen of duty.  In the clash, 190 Nagas were injured and hospitalised and many priests and policemen too were injured.

Since then, the entry of the Nagas has been banned in Puri.

The Langali mutt at Katak  is under disputed ownership. The section which has the two temples is in a very bad condition. The entire complex is on the verge of collapse. The Lacchman Mutt at Balkati is an abandoned structure near the bank of the river. 

It is used to store cow-dung patties by the nearby locals. These important vestiges of the Old Jagannath Sadak should be properly restored.","The article discusses the demolition of the Bada Akhada Mutt in Puri and the impact on the Naga Sadhus who resided there. The mutt's open site remains, and while a small temple, the Gadi of the Mahant, and the kitchen were spared, the heritage and historic values are perceived as lost forever. The piece also recounts the history of Naga Sadhus in Puri, mentioning other mutts like the Langali Mutt in Cuttack and the Lacchman Mutt in Balakati on the banks of the Daya river. The ban on Nagas' entry into Puri is highlighted, along with past clashes and violence during events like the Nabakalebar of 1950.

Deccan Chronicle ,1938-01-13 00:00:00,ISRO achieves milestone with successful space docking experiment launch,"""So, as far as we are concerned, the rocket has placed the spacecraft in the right orbit and the SpaDeX satellites have moved one behind the other, and over the period of time, it will pick up further distance, travel about 20 km away and then the rendezvous and docking process will start.
""And we hope that the docking process can happen in another week and the nominal time is going to be approximately January 7,"" he said in his address from the Mission Control Centre. In this mission, the very important part is the POEM-4 with 24 payloads from startups, industries, academia and also from ISRO centres, he said. These are scheduled to be fired on Tuesday morning. Scientists would work through the night to ensure that the POEM-4 reaches the desired orbit level to perform the operation, Somanath said.
Later, talking to reporters at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Somanath said the PSLV-C60 mission placed the two SpaDeX satellites weighing 220kg in a circular orbit and 475 km as against the projected 470 km and this mission also has the POEM-4 which has 24 payloads to perform research and development. ""They are payloads and are not satellites. They are going to be attached to the fourth stage (of the PSLV rocket) for conducting experiments over the next two months. The upper stage of the PSLV rocket will be brought down to a lowered orbit to 350 km and that process is currently going on. After that, we will have many activities to continue,"" Somanath, also the Secretary, Department of Space, said
On the Space Docking Experiment, he said the scientists would have many operations from December 31 at the ISTRAC Bengaluru and he expected that the docking condition 'possibly on January 7'. ""So, we will be able to see that from the Control Centre, ISTRAC, Bengaluru. All those activities of docking, including telecasting of the onboard images from the camera of the docking processes,"" he said. Somanath, flanked by SpaDeX Project Director N Surendran, Mission Director M Jayakumar and Directors of the various Centre said ISRO was 'very proud' of this accomplishment and expressed hope that the SpaDeX mission's objective can be achieved in the coming days. ""Really important mission for us, this you know, with the space sector reforms, and expansion of space activities. Then we have human space flight programmes, building space stations etc. This (Monday's) mission is so critical for us to work on future missions like the Chandrayaan-4, missions to the Moon as well,"" he said. ""I believe this is not the first SpaDeX and there will be many more SpaDeX varieties including complex versions of docking systems in the coming days,"" he said. Mission Director M Jayakumar said, ""Hearty congratulations to the team ISRO for venturing into the exciting domain of Space Docking and this Mission once again has POEM-4. We have 24 payloads, and some interesting experiments in POEM-4 like debris capture, and biological experiments are there."" ""We had two launches of the PSLV from the same launch pad that is the first launch pad in December. So, after the first launch (on December 5 for PSLV-C59/Proba-3 mission), the Satish Dhawan Space Centre team was quick in raising to the occasion (for Monday's mission),"" he said. Surendran said, ""I would like to congratulate the PSLV team for the successive successful launch of PSLV in a month, it is a record, we have also placed our twin babies in a perfectly circular orbit, as per our requirement. ""I am happy to say that our solar panels are successfully deployed and the spacecraft are on their journey and holding their wings towards the docking and it is expected to happen around January first week,"" he said. As you are aware the space sector is going through a phase to enable private players to meet the growing demands, as per the policy guidelines, SpaDeX was assembled and integrated here for the first time, he said. Dubbed as a prelude to the ISRO setting up its own Space Station by 2035, the PSLV-C60 mission would also make India join an elite club in achieving this feat which is expected to take place in the coming days. The 44.5-metre-tall rocket carried two spacecraft -- Spacecraft A and B, each weighing 220 kg which would help in space docking, satellite servicing and interplanetary missions. After the culmination of the 25-hour countdown which commenced on Sunday, the rocket lifted off at 10 pm from the First Launch Pad at this spaceport, emanating thick orange-coloured fumes and thunderous sound in the island, located about 135 km east of Chennai. According to ISRO scientists, the two spacecraft-Spacecraft A (SDX01) or the 'Chaser' and Spacecraft B (SDX02) or the 'Target' would be merged together later at an altitude of about 470 km after travelling at the same speed and distance. By mastering the docking technologies, ISRO is set to enhance its operational flexibility and also expand its mission horizons. This technology is essential for some of India's space ambitions like Indian on the Moon, getting samples from the Moon (Chandrayaan-4 mission), and building and operating the Bharatiya Antariksh Station. ""In-space docking technology is essential when multiple rocket launches are required to achieve common mission objectives. Through this mission, India is marching towards becoming the fourth country in the world to have space docking technology,"" ISRO said. The others to achieve this technological feat are China, Russia and the US
","ISRO's PSLV-C60 mission successfully placed two SpaDeX satellites, Spacecraft A and B, into a precise circular orbit of 475 km, exceeding expectations. These satellites aim to demonstrate space docking technology, crucial for satellite servicing, interplanetary missions, and India's ambitious space projects like Chandrayaan-4 and Bharatiya Antariksh Station. Docking operations are expected by January 7, 2024, monitored from ISTRAC, Bengaluru.  

The mission also carried POEM-4 with 24 payloads for experiments in debris capture, biological studies, and more.

The New Indian Express ,1947-12-08 00:00:00,India independent,"August 15th, 1947 will go down in history as one of the most memorable dates, not for India alone but for Asia and the world. For India, it marks the end of an old era and the beginning of a new age. For Asia, it gives a new leader, a new outlook, a new future. For the world, it gives a new India and a new method. India has attained her independence in a unique manner, with unique weapons, and along unique lines. She has shown the world that a subject country, however docile, can still organise itself into a powerful fighting unit by sheer force of will and without resort to the sword, defy the most formidable imperialist power on Earth, render its striking power ineffective, and wrench and preserve freedom with peace as its mantra and satyagraha as its means. Through mainly the inspiration and instrumentality of Mahatma Gandhi, who embodies all that is best and noblest in India, this country has reached its goal without violence. The Indian National Congress which constituted the spearhead of India’s struggle for freedom, has in the course of a little over half a century, won for the country the greatest of all assets, independence. The names of the heroes thrown up in the process are legion; those who died for it are many and those who remain are not few. To all those who have striven, the consummation must come as a prize and an emblem. India is at last free. That this freedom is temporarily fissured and broken does not alter the fact that the heritage is common, that the future is yet to be made. The task before Indians therefore is to preserve the common heritage and to shape the future. Reconstruction and unity must be the aim. It is possible that it may take long to materialize, but that should be no cause for regret. Did not even America, with less complexities, take well-nigh a century to realise her goal of unity? One should hope, however, that India will achieve it much earlier. And while hoping it is worth remembering that just as the past belongs to India and Pakistan alike, the future too belongs to both. It should be remembered also that the country has achieved its freedom at a time when the whole world is at the cross-roads, between life and death, wandering between archaic colonialism and empire philosophy on the one hand and liberty on the other. That the people in this continent have a special role to play in it cannot be overlooked. But to fulfil the mission, Indians have to achieve unity and peace among themselves so that they may help to bring about peace and goodwill among the nations of the world that are now rent by mutual jealousies and suspicion. In the circumstances, a sense of responsibility is as important as resources of mind and character. It is the essence of national self-discipline and Pandit Nehru gave expression to the right sentiment, when, inaugurating the Liberty Week he laid great stress on these qualities. The strength of a chain being the strength of its weakest link; the effort admits of no relaxation. While therefore we should aim at strength and solidarity and ensure good government for realisation of future destiny we should also remember that self-government is not to be an instrument of power alone but an opportunity of service. It is in the spirit of service today that India enters the comity of nations as a free and self-reliant entity. She does so as a nation not weak and embittered by a prolonged struggle for freedom but as a nation resurgent, a power with untold potentialities for good. She realises that not only herself, but along with her the whole of Asia has risen; large parts of which are liberated already, others are in the process of liberation. In such an eventuality India will utilise her freedom not merely for her own material interests much less for domination over others, but to lead and help Asia, nay the whole world. She remembers only too well that, for this, she has to repair her own economy, her own damaged freedom. But with her present leaders still in trim, she feels confident that with a little more effort, she can achieve her purpose. The partition of the country must go, tension must disappear, progressive understanding of the need for space and concord must be promoted unceasingly, common action in mutual interest being always in mind. The need also for citizens to identify self with the State being important, every citizen must live for India just as India must live for all. To adapt great words to a great occasion, India expects every man to do his duty do the same","August 15th, 1947, is a historic date, not just for India but for Asia and the world. It signifies the end of an era and the dawn of a new age. India's unique path to independence, guided by Mahatma Gandhi's principles of non-violence, stands as a testament to the country's will and determination. The Indian National Congress played a pivotal role in achieving this freedom after a struggle spanning over half a century.
Despite temporary challenges, the common heritage shared by India and Pakistan should be preserved for a unified future. Reconstruction and unity are crucial objectives, acknowledging that the journey might take time. India, gaining freedom in a world at a crossroads, has a significant role to play in promoting peace and goodwill among nations. This responsibility necessitates a sense of national self-discipline and a commitment to service.
Entering the global stage as a free and self-reliant nation, India recognizes the potential for positive contributions. The spirit of service guides India to utilize its freedom not for self-interest or dominance but to lead and assist Asia and the world. The focus remains on repairing the economy, fostering understanding, eliminating tension, and promoting mutual cooperation. The call for citizens to identify with the State emphasizes the collective responsibility for the nation's well-being. As India moves forward, every citizen is urged to do their duty for the country.

Indian Express,1950-01-03 00:00:00,Commission In Madras,"Mr. D. L. Mazumdar, member-secretary of the Fiscal Commission, returned to Delhi today froın Calcutta after further discus- sions with trade interests in connection with the Commission's enquiry there.

Over the week-end, Mr. Mazumdar met representatives of the Indian Mining Cor- poration and the Indian Colliery Owners Association and other trade organisations, whom the Commission, as a whole, was un- able to examine during its session there.

The next session of the Commission is scheduled to commence in Madras from Jan. 6.

During its session in Calcutta, the ad- ministration of some of the industrial and commercial controls and the Central and Provincial Governments' present attitude towards them are stated to have come in for some general comments. The consen- sus of opinion favoured a gradual loosen- ing of the rigidity of controls over commo- dities whose present supply position justi- fled such relaxation. In regard to controls in respect of coal,

particularly the distribution control, it was felt that a comprehensive review of the

position needed to be now undertaken by a competent body. There was, however,

general agreement that coal was a category by itself and that nationalisation of that

industry could be effectively carried out only if a national coal commission. was

set up without delay.

While there was discontent over the working of commercial and exchange con- trols, s, the general view seemed to be that a consistent and co-ordinated policy would be impossible till the whole field of indus- trial and commercial administration was integrated through a coherent and com- prehensive policy. The absence of such a machinery at present was commented upon and the majority of the chambers and pro- minent individuals were understood to have emphasised the need to set up a central machinery for administrative co-ordination for example, a ministry for economic affairs and a similar machinery for the overall economic planning, E.G. a planning com-

mission. Detailed control and regulation of indus- tries were uniformly opposed and the view was expressed that the main function of the Planning Commission should be the formulation of the pattern of the coun- try's industrial and agricultural develop- ment and the general direction of the eco- nomic forces towards the achievement of that pattern. The Ministry of Economic Affairs would be primarily concerned with securing day-to-day administrative co-or- dination within the framework of the pat-

tern evolved by the Planning Commission. It was generally felt that fiscal policy

by itself could not function in isolation from the other measures to secure com-

mercial and industrial progress, Fiscal policy must form part of an integrated

industrial and commercial policy.

A suggestion was made to the Commis- sion that the Tariff Board should consti- co tute one wing of a more comprehensive planning organisation which should also consist of sections responsible for progress- ing the recommendations of the Tariff Board and for the promotion and develop- ment of the industrial potential of the country.-P.Τ.Ι.","Mr. D. L. Mazumdar, member-secretary of the Fiscal Commission, returned to Delhi from Calcutta after discussing trade matters. Views from various trade bodies favored easing commodity controls, especially coal, and advocated for a national coal commission. Integrated economic policies, including fiscal, were deemed essential, with suggestions for a central planning machinery.",Politics,51,487

Indian Express,1950-01-20 00:00:00,Statutory Planning Body For India : Congress Executive's Recommendation,"The Congress Working Committee today adopted a resolution recommending to the Government of India the appointment of a statutory Planning Commission. It is proposed that suitable boards of experts should be appointed to assist the Planning Commission.
The duties of the Commission would include the determination of priorities, securing full and all-round coordination in the process of planning and in the execution of the plan and laying down the various stages, each covering a de- fined period, for the development of the country's economy.
Following is the text of the resolution:
""Recognition of the vital role of planning in the development of our national economy and the realization of the people's aspirations for social justice and progress led to the appointment of the National Planning Committee in the year 1938. Working under the limitations, inseparable from the political conditions of the period in which it functioned, the Committee achieved valuable results in making the conception of planning familiar in the country and in carrying through a great deal of spade work.
""In modern country conditions of life no can hope to administer its affairs with success or with any degree of satisfaction to the mass of the people without recourse to the powerful instrument of social and economic planning. The need for a comprehensive plan has become a matter of compelling urgency in India now owing to the ravages of the Second World War and the economic and political consequences of the partition of the country which followed in the wake of the achievement of freedom, and the steady worsening of the economic situation in India and the world.
""The tasks of a planning body for India have already been set by the course of the country's struggle for freedom. What the economic content of the people's freedom should be has been indicated in general terms in the resolutions and manifestoes of the Indian National Congress, in the pronouncements of Mahatma Gandhi and other Congress leaders and in the Congress economic programme. 
""The vision which inspired the people of India through the various phases of the non-violent revolution which made the country free was of a land from which poverty, unemployment, ignorance, inequality and exploitation would be banished and in which every person would find work suitable to his talents and capacity and have the wherewithal of a decent life. With the achievement of complete independence it becomes the paramount duty of the Congress to take immediate steps for the fulfilment of its solemn pledges and for producing the conditions in which the people's creative energies and enthusiasm can be evoked and harnessed in the fullest measure in the great endeavour to bring into being a just and progressive social order. 
The Constitution which the people of India have just adopted embodies certain directive principles of State policy which have also an intimate earing on the forms of social and economic organization to be evolved and which must be rendered in terms of programmes of action to be formulated by the planning authority.
""In order that the declarations of the Congress and the directive principles of the Constitution are made effective in as short a time as possible, it is desirable that a statutory Planning Commission be set up. by the Government of India. ""
The Planning Commission should be a compact body composed of persons. whose selection is made primarily with the view that the outlook of the Commission is in harmony with the basic ideas which should govern the plan and that it possesses a comprehensive. understanding of the administrative, social, political and economic needs and conditions of the country.
""The Commission should be assisted by boards of experts who may together be able to provide it with all the information and advice necessary for the adequate performance of its functions. The Commission should be equipped with a special statistical organisation and should be in a position to make use of the administrative machinery of the country for the collection of the requisite statistical and factual material. In order to bring the plan and its
execution into tune with the needs and aspirations of the people the Commission should devise measures to secure their association and co-operation at all levels.""
OBJECTIVES
The principal objectives to be realised through such a plan are:
(1) The establishment of a just order of society, providing for: (a) the operation of the principles of decentralisation, co-operation, and individual freedom to the utmost feasible extent; (b) Equal opportunity for all; (c) adequate means of living for all; (d)just and humane conditions of work; (e) full and suitable employment, and (f) the growth of the human personality in all its aspects;
(2) Adequate and expanding volume of production to secure a progressive rise in the standard of living and the achievement of a national minimum in respect of all the essentials for physical and social well-being, within a period.
(3) The best utilisation of the material and human resources of the nation and the improvement of the skill and the productive capacity of its manpower by suitable technical education and training;
(4) As near an approach to national and regional self-sufficiency as would be compatible with the requirements of an adequate standard of living and the country's internal and external security.
COMMISSION'S DUTIES
""The Planning Commission should have the following duties:
(1) To make a full assessment of the resources and the requirements of the nation;
(2) To determine priorities, to work out a proper allocation and distribution
of the resources and their constant adjustments to the changing requirements with a view to obtaining the speediest and the maximum realisation of the objectives of the plan;
(3) To lay down the various stages, each covering a defined period, for the development of the country's economy and to undertake the necessary preparatory work in connection with each stage and
(4) To secure full and all-round coordination in the process of planning and in the execution of the plan.
""In the context of the present needs and the circumstances of the country and in view of the acute economic difficulties which are being experienced, the commission should devise immediate measures: (a) to reduce to the minimum the dependence of the country on foreign sources in the matters of consumer goods, to bring about a speedy elimination of the import of luxury goods and such other articles as are not indispensable regardless of the inconvenience that may be felt by any section of the population; (b) to secure the necessary capital goods for increasing the internal production of the needed articles as quickly as possible; (c) and to maximise the production of  the essential primary goods, specially foodstuffs and raw materials for the principal industries, in the shortest
time possible; (d) to speed up projects for increasing the irrigation facilities and power supply of the country, which are the basis of its prosperity and progress.""
The Working Committee will discuss organisational matters tomorrow and conclude its four-day session.-----PTI","The Congress Working Committee has passed a resolution recommending the establishment of a statutory Planning Commission in India. The proposed commission would be responsible for determining priorities, coordinating planning efforts, and outlining stages of economic development. It suggests the appointment of expert boards to assist the Planning Commission in its duties.

The resolution acknowledges the importance of planning in achieving social justice, progress, and economic stability. It highlights the need for comprehensive planning in India due to the aftermath of World War II, partition, and worsening economic conditions. The resolution aligns with the visions expressed by the Indian National Congress and leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, focusing on eradicating poverty, unemployment, inequality, and exploitation.

The resolution emphasizes the establishment of a just society, equal opportunities, adequate living standards, suitable employment, and overall individual growth. It also emphasizes the efficient utilization of resources, improving the nation's skill and productive capacity through technical education, and striving for self-sufficiency while maintaining a decent standard of living and national security.

Immediate measures are suggested to reduce dependence on foreign sources, increase domestic production, maximize essential goods production, and accelerate projects related to irrigation and power supply.

Dominion to republic
Although British rule in India ended on August 15, 1947, India was yet to sever all ties with the Empire. For over two years after Independence, India remained a British dominion, governed by the British-era Government of India Act of 1935, and officially still owing allegiance to the Crown.

The Statesman,1950-01-26 00:00:00,Synthetic Drug May Help Cure Some Arthritis,"The statement suggests that a synthetic drug shows potential for treating certain types of arthritis. Arthritis is a group of inflammatory joint diseases that cause pain, swelling, and stiffness, affecting millions of people worldwide. Traditional treatments often include pain relievers, anti-inflammatory drugs, and disease-modifying medications, but they may not always be effective for all patients or may come with side effects.

The synthetic drug being studied offers a promising alternative. Developed through scientific research, this drug is designed to target specific pathways involved in the inflammatory response associated with arthritis. By modulating these pathways, the drug aims to reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms associated with arthritis.

Clinical trials and studies are likely underway to assess the safety and efficacy of the synthetic drug in treating arthritis. If successful, this drug could provide a much-needed treatment option for individuals with arthritis, offering relief from pain and improving quality of life.

Overall, the development of synthetic drugs for arthritis represents a significant advancement in medical research and could potentially revolutionize the treatment of this debilitating condition.

Military parades are symbolic expressions of state authority and prestige. During the British Raj, royal parades and processions were common occurrences, projecting colonial power to Indians and the world.

The Indian Express - January 28, 1950 - India becomes a Republic

There’s a difference in knowing from a history book and learning via a historical source. Accounts from a time when an historical event happened and later day interpretations by historians have a different flavour and a blend of both is necessary.

Most of us know about January 26, 1950 (and many don’t), but for me the knowledge was mostly through history books. Reading a newspaper account of the events of India’s first Republic Day revealed many dimensions of the day that I was never aware of.

I had read and heard accounts of what the Indian communists did during the 1962 Indo-China War, but wasn’t aware that the commies were also opposed to the idea of India becoming a republic (I wasn’t a history student for long). Discovered this through a news item on violent anti-Republic Day demonstrations by the communists in different parts of the country, on the front page of the January 28, 1950 edition of The Indian Express, Madras.

Also that one BG Keshkar attempted to assassinate the Nizam of Hyderabad the same day.

But what is more captivating is the account of the Republic Day events, as described in the newspaper (January 26, 1950 was a national holiday so there was no Indian Express dated January 27, 1950 and therefore the accounts of the Republic Day were published on the January 28, 1950 edition).

INDIA PROCLAIMED SOVEREIGN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC

RAJENDRA PRASAD SWORN IN AS PRESIDENT

Proclamation Read Out By Retiring Governor-General

NEW DELHI, Jan. 26.
The birth of the Indian sovereign democratic Republic was proclaimed at 10-18 this morning by the country’s last Governor-General Mr. Chakravarti Rajagopalachari at the Durbar Hall at Government House in the capital and the Republic’s first President Dr. Rajendra Prasad took the oath of office to the boom of a salute of 31 guns at a most brilliant ceremony.

Until 1976, India was constitutionally described only as a “sovereign democratic Republic,” the words “socialist” and “secular” were added by the 42nd Constitutional amendment in 1976. The Government House is what we now knows as the Rashtrapati Bhawan.

The language of news journalism has changed so much over decades. Back then, when there was no 24×7 television news, the language of print was more visual than analytical. Read and you can feel being transported to an India six decades ago.

As Dr Rajendra Prasad stepped into the coach and the two A.D.C.s took their seats facing him there were shouts of joy and crowds once again made a rush through the cordons. The Coach drove out of Government House at a slow trot escorted by the President’s Body Guards. All along the route the President was welcomed by shouts of joy. The President responded to the greetings of the people by bowing to them with folded hands. The drive, which began exactly at 2:30 p.m., ended exactly at 3:45 p.m. at Irwin Stadium where 3,000 officers and men of the three Services and the police with massed bands had taken position for a ceremonial parade. The Stadium was packed with visitors, with National Flags and the new flags of the Services fluttering all around the Stadium, it presented a site of splendour, the colourfulness of the scene being heightened by the drab walls of the historic Purana Qila in the background.

FANFARE OF TRUMPETS

A fanfare of trumpet announced the arrival of the President and there was loud cheering as he stepped down from the coach, and was received by the Defence Minister, Sardar Balder Singh. The three Service Chiefs were then presented to the President, who accompanied by the Defence Minister and the Service Chiefs, went to the Saluting Base. The parade gave the national salute to the President, the National Flag was broken at mast and while the whole assembly stood massed bands played the National Anthem. A brightly-painted jeep took the President and the Commander of the Parade. Brig. Dhillon, round the units on parade. The inspection over, the President returned to the base of the dais and a salute of 31 guns was fired in three instalments. In between the parade fired a fes-de-joie thrice. The most exciting moment came when the parade gave the President three jais while a flight of I.A.F. Liberators roared past over the Stadium.

The march-past now began and the admiring crowds cheered each unit as it crossed the base. It was a smart turn-out and among those who received specially loud cheers were the Air Force, the Gurkhas and the boys of the Punjab Regiment. The massed bands were the last to march past and were cheered equally loudly. On the President’s departure from the Parade Ground there was another sound of trumpets and one of the most impressive ceremonies seen in years came to an end. The President drove from Irwin Stadium to Government House at 4:30 p.m. The crowds had swelled the route through Kingsway and they cheered the President all along.

Historic in its significance, it was an unforgettable day. It was a day of joy and the ruminations all over the Capital at night showed how happily and enthusiastically the people welcomed the advent of the Republic.

P.T.I. reports: A spectacular parade of the Defence Services climaxed the five-mile-long Presidential procession. Twenty thousand spectators, including President Soekarno of Indonesia, Pandit Nehru, the Deputy Prime Minister, Sardar Patel, and other Cabinet Ministers, members of the diplomatic corps, members of Parliament and men, and women and children from all walks of life watched the President take the National Salute. Tricolours, a huge Asoka capitol placed in the main stadium, the flags of the three Services, the multicoloured berets, caps, turbans and buckles, the gorgeous costumes of the massed bandsmen, the picturesque uniforms of the President’s Bodyguard escorting the President’s coach-and-six, the saffron and red decorations--everything contributed to a feast of colour and pageantry befitting the first ceremonial parade held in the capital of the new Republic.

A tremendous cheer went up as they sighted the President’s coach, drawn by six chestnut horses and escorted by his mounted Bodyguard in scarlet tunics and a detachment of the Gwalior Lancers. Liveried footmen held aloft a red and gold umbrella. A fanfare of trumpets heralded his arrival. Dr Rajendra Prasad, wearing black achkan and churiders and Gandhi cap, bowed smilingly in acknowledgment of the cheers of the multitude. The parade-the Navy as the seniormost Service formed to the left, the Army in ochre green in the centre and the Air Force, boys of the Punjab Regiment and the police to the right then gave the President the National Salute, which replaced the old Royal salute. The National Flag was broken at half-mast and massed bands played Rabindranath Tagore’s Jana Gana Mana.

Conducted by the Officer Commanding the parade, Brig. J. S. Dhillon, Dr Prasad then inspected the parade from a green-painted jeep flying the Presidents Flag.

As the President returned to the dais 31 guns boomed and the men assembled in parade cracked their rifles thrice, firing feu-de-joie. each volley followed by the National Anthem. The parade gave the President three vigorous jais as the artillery smoke hid the view for the spectators perched precariously on top of the crumbling walls of the Purana Qila.","The Republic of India was inaugurated with great enthusiasm and celebration as Dr. Rajendra Prasad was sworn in as its first President.

“Freshers” in the House went about paying their respects to the “elders,” including some Ministers and the Congress President.

Ministers hurriedly stepped to their seats. Maulana Azad, who had arrived simultaneously with the Speaker, must have been embarrassed while going to his seat as the House stood. The Prime Minister was not in his seat when Mr. Mavlankar sat down after bowing to all sides of the House.

MADRAS: “I have absolutely no doubt that whenever a referendum is held in Kashmir the vote will be in favour of India and not in favour of Pakistan,” said Sheikh Abdullah, Chief Minister of Kashmir, today.

He was addressing a largely-attended meeting at a local college this morning.

Hindustan Times - your fastest source for breaking news! Read now.
He said he was not making this statement in a spirit of emotion. There were many people in India who still asked if a referendum was held in Kashmir, how the Muslims there could vote for India instead of for Pakistan.

“To them.” Sheikh Abdullah said, “I say the people of Kashmir did not join hands with Pakistan when there was nobody to stop them from doing so. If Mr Jinnah and his friends were so sure that the Muslims of Kashmir would vote for Pakistan, they would never have I launched their attack on Kashmir.”

“Kashmir has chosen to align herself with India,” he said, “not because ( of any coercion or of any mutual I advantage but because the people of Kashmir feel ideologically on the same level as the people of India. We feel there is that ideological similarity between us and India and, therefore, our alliance will be with India and not with Pakistan.

“If the Muslims of Kashmir would resist aggression from Pakistan when they had no friends, why should anybody in India now expect a change in the minds of Kashmir people, when India has helped them against this aggression for these two years with men, money and moral support and when hundreds of comrades from all parts of India have given their all-out help to us and given their lives on the soil of Kashmir and cemented the bonds between Kashmir and India? Nobody should think that human beings are so ungrateful.

The Difference

“We can see a ray of hope in Pandit Nehru and other leaders of India who are trying to resist communal theories in India and everywhere in the world. But in Pakistan we find quite the opposite. They are trying to build their State on communal hatred while we are building ours on secular democracy. As believers in secular democracy, our duty is to help those forces trying to implement the same ideologies in their country. We shall always be with India and never with Pakistan.”

“What is after all religion and what does religion teach?” Sheikh Abdullah asked. ‘You read the Gita and the Quran. Religion always teaches the brotherhood of man and it does not teach hatred.”

“We have thought,” Sheikh Abdullah continued, “and chalked out our programme and future line of action most carefully and we are sure that whatever may happen, we the people of Kashmir, will not waver from the path we have chosen long ago”.

“I assure you that Kashmir will always be with Jawaharlal and Jawaharlal will be with Kashmir Whatever may happen Jawaharlal is not going to abandon Kashmir and I may assure you we are not going to abandon India.”

Righteous Cause

“Of course, we have many difficulties. Many difficulties we have surmounted and more we have yet to face, but so long as our cause is just we do not baffle about the results. That is the sermon of the Gita. As long as our cause is just, we are sure to win. Even if we give up our lives in the cause of righteousness that will not be considered as defeat. That is the noble lesson which Mahatma Gandhi has taught us. Even if we have to sacrifice our very lives m that path, we shall have the satisfaction that we have done our bit for the right cause.”

Sheikh Abdullah said though they had succeeded in driving out the foreign masters from the land, he did not believe the country was yet free. Though the country was physically free, so long as the people remained mentally slaves, the freedom they had won was worth nothing. He therefore, wanted the student whom the future of the country rested, to analyse calmly the causes of slavery of this great sub-continent and then try to avoid all those pitfalls and remove all those weaknesses which in the past had led to their subjugation.

The partition of the country, he said. was due to their internal weakness. “Our main approach to that question was fundamentally wrong. We should have demolished the very basis on which Mr Jinnah tried to build his Pakistan. We ought to have attacked the very fundamentals on which the two-nation theory was built.”

Sheikh Abdullah wanted the people to realize that it was “due to our weakness that India was subjected to foreign rule and it was due to our own weakness that the country was partitioned and it will again he due to our weakness that our freedom would not last long”.

The Kashmiris, he said, were working for the goal of secular democracy, the removal of economic exploitation of the people, the abolition of the zamindari and the putting down of communalism. Students could help in the cause by strengthening the spirit of secular democracy in India. The stronger the secular democracy grew in India, the stronger would the bonds between India and Kashmir be. He urged them to work for communal peace, secular democracy and fight against economic exploitation and economic and social inequalities.","On February 13, 1950, Sheikh Abdullah, Chief Minister of Kashmir, confidently stated that in any future referendum in Kashmir, the vote would be in favor of India, not Pakistan. Speaking at a meeting in Madras, he emphasized that Kashmir's alignment with India was not due to coercion or mutual advantage but stemmed from ideological similarity. He highlighted the historical resistance of Kashmiris against aggression from Pakistan and expressed gratitude for India's support. Abdullah underscored the importance of secular democracy and urged cooperation to resist communal theories, contrasting India's approach with Pakistan's communal stance. He emphasized the need to address internal weaknesses to avoid subjugation, advocating for secular democracy, economic justice, and communal peace.",Politics,113,968

The Hitavada,1950-04-05 00:00:00,Prague espionage trial against bishops & priests begins,"The Prague espionage trial against bishops and priests, occurring during the Cold War, reflects a complex intersection of politics and religion in Czechoslovakia. In the early 1950s, the Communist government, led by President Antonín Zápotocký, sought to suppress perceived opposition, including the Catholic Church, viewed as a potential influence counter to the state's ideology.

The trial, which commenced in a politically charged atmosphere, accused several bishops and priests of engaging in anti-state activities and espionage on behalf of the Vatican. The charges were part of a broader campaign to weaken the Church's influence in Czechoslovakia. The defendants faced allegations of collaborating with foreign powers and engaging in activities that were considered subversive.

The prosecution contended that the Church, with its allegiance to Rome, posed a threat to the Communist regime's authority. The trial was marked by an absence of due process, with allegations of forced confessions and political motivations behind the proceedings. The Communist government aimed to diminish the influence of the Church and strengthen its control over all aspects of society.

The Prague espionage trial against bishops and priests is emblematic of the broader tensions between Communist regimes and religious institutions during the Cold War. It highlighted the struggle for influence between political ideologies and established religious institutions in Eastern Europe. The trial underscored the lengths to which authoritarian regimes would go to suppress dissent, control religious organizations, and ensure ideological conformity.

In the aftermath of the trial, many clergy members were imprisoned, and the Catholic Church faced severe restrictions, significantly impacting its ability to operate openly in Czechoslovakia. The events surrounding the trial remain a poignant chapter in the history of the Cold War, illustrating the complex dynamics between political authorities and religious institutions in the pursuit of influence and control.","The Prague espionage trial against bishops and priests in the early 1950s was a manifestation of the Cold War struggle between the Communist government in Czechoslovakia and the Catholic Church.

But for one incident which caused the death of 28 persons, the programme went through without a hitch although the control of the milling crowds imposed the greatest strain on the mela authorities.

Hindustan Times - your fastest source for breaking news! Read now.
It is gathered that a magisterial ioquiry has been ordered into the cause of the accident when two large crowds, one coming from the railway station and the other going after having a bath in the Brahma Kund tried to rush the barrier with the result that when one of the barriers was suddenly closed 28 persons were crushed to death against the iron bar.

The real attraction of the Kumbh Mela for the tamasha-minded folk was the procession of various akharas (spiritual centres). From time immemorial these akharas have enjoyed precedence over the general public in having a dip in the sacred pool. The sadhus of these akharas moved in procession with the glitter and glamour that would be the envy of rajas and maharajas. A score of elephants with silver howdahs and a dozen silver palanquins gave touch of pomp which pleased the crowds. The head of one of the akharas gave modern touch by using a jeep but did not complete the journey and had to abandon it.

NUDE SADHUS

Perhaps the most unique aspect of the mela is that among the processionists were about 2,000 nude sadhus with ash-besmeared bodies who walked in the presence of 2 million spectators. That none felt horrified and many devotees bowed their heads in reverence is explained by the fact that orthodox Hindus place the renunciation of worldly things as the highest ideal and the nude sadhus seem to them to symbolize that faith.

But not all who participated in the procession were genuine sadhus. Some worldly persons who have taken shelter in the various akhara headquarters put on saffron clothes for the day to have the privilege of a bath in the sacred pool in the style of the elite. For, the common people were held in check until all the akharas, according to the warrant of precedence fixed from time immemorial had their bath.

Since the adherents of this half a dozen akharas numbered about 1,50,000 they occupied the pool in turn for six hours. Thus it was not until 9 p.m. that the general public got the chance of having a dip in the Brahma Kund and bathing by them continued well past midnight. The mela area resounded throughout the day with cries of Ganga Mai Ki Jai.

The VIP’s who rode half a dozen elephants, and the common folk, 5,000 of whom rushed to the narrow over-bridge and occupied it contrary to instructions, had the grand-stand view of the mela. Considerable excitement was caused when an aeroplane of the Hindustan Times flew over the mela area ana took pictures of the crowd.

The mela arrangements were completely successful in the matter of providing shelter and food and keeping control on disease. The antimalaria measures were so effective that residents of Hardwar said that they had not known such relief from mosquitoes at any time. Old residents of the town stated that this year’s mela was the most elaborately arranged affair and that it had beer: the best-attended m living memory.","On April 14, 1950, the Kumbh Mela, hailed as the world's greatest fair, took place with vibrant and dramatic scenes in India.

The Indian troops were in Kashmir at the invitation of her people. It was because of this that India. undertook the responsibility of clearing the State of the raiders. He himself did not feel in the least worried or doubtful regarding Kashmir’s future.

There was, he added, overwhelming support in India for every action he took on Kashmir. He was sure that the Kashmir people had also sought India’s aid and friendship with due deliberation. If they did not want India’s association with Kashmir, though he would be sorry himself he would be prepared to accept that decision.

Pandit Nehru told the National Conference workers that it was for them to explain to the masses where their interests lay and guide them along the proper path. After all ultimately it was the people who gave strength and support to any particular cause and without their support even Governments could not function.

In a passing reference to Pakistan the Prime Minister said that India having agreed to the creation of Pakistan, she would not now like to go back on partition.

INDIA’S ROLE

Reviewing the international situation, Pandit Nehru said during the past two years or so India had made rapid strides and grown in international stature. Her role in international affairs was growing in importance. Other Powers were keenly watching developments in India and they were anxious to make friends with her. India was able to achieve this importance, because she faced with courage and steadfastness many of the difficult problems that confronted her since partition.

Referring to his forthcoming visit to Indonesia he said that India and Indonesia had come closer to each other. He felt sure that the present bonds would grow stronger in the future. India had become a greater brother of many of the Asian countries. They were looking forward to her for leadership and friendly support.

ABDULLAH RENEWS PLEDGE

Speaking on the occasion, Sheikh Abdullah renewed his State’s pledge of final accession to India. Kashmir, he said, was bound with India which was a secular democracy and would continue to maintain these bonds with her.

India, upheld certain ideals which appealed to the people of Kashmir. It was in answer to Kashmir’s call that Indian troops had fought in the heights of Kashmir to save thousands of innocent people from the violence let loose by the followers of a communal ideology.

Kashmir, he reiterated, would follow the policy of communal harmony between the different sections of her people.","On May 15, 1950, Pandit Nehru addressed nearly 1,000 workers of the All-Jammu and Kashmir National Conference, reiterating India's stance on Kashmir.

Hindustan Times,1950-05-24 00:00:00,Freedom from foreign food by 1952,"Mr K. M. Munshi, India’s Food Minister, today outlined a four-point objective to secure freedom from imports of foreign food by the end of 1951.
Mr Munshi, who was addressing the Indian Merchants’ Chamber, at an “ At Home “ given in his honour, added that this was to be realized by making India self-sufficient in food, which would be the first concern of the Central and State Governments, by an integration of the programme of cotton and jute production with the “ grow more food “ campaign and by the adoption of austerity measures to help achieve the margin of production essential to remove controls.

“ We have won political freedom,” he said, “ but if we are to be really tree, we must win freedom from foreign bread.”

Calling for the fullest co-operation from the country in the very difficult task he had undertaken, the Food Minister said that during the next 19 months India had to reclaim two million acres of land, construct 3,000 tubewells and produce three million tons of cereals, 12 lakh bales of cotton and 28 lakh bales of jute and mesta.
Mr Munshi quoted a critic who said that he had taken a portfolio which was considered the grave of one’s reputation. Though he (Mr Munshi) knew little about either food or agriculture he was confident that he could do much to improve the position, provided there was all-round co-operation.

As soon as the British left us, the world thought the country would fall to pieces in a few months. In fact, he said, while he was in Hyderabad he had seen a note left by the retiring British Resident to the effect that he would be back in the State soon since he was certain the Central Government would collapse within six months.

Mr Munshi further said that during his recent tour of the U.S.A. and Britain he found the administrators and people having tremendous respect for India and her leaders for the way they had tackled many-sided problems after assuming power. They also appreciated the way in which India stabilized herself and thus stabilized the position of Asia as a whole, since the stability of Asia depended upon India’s stability.

India’s leaders in charge of the government had done well during these three years of independence and hence the people should look to their credit side instead of merely criticizing them incessantly for things left undone. The will of the people should be there for the Government to achieve anything.

The Food Minister admitted that the statistics prepared by his Ministry were not above criticism, since the system of collecting them was wrong. He proposed instead a five-year crop cutting experiment to gather correct statistics.

There was also confusion in the minds of agricultural officers in regard to the importance of raising food and cash crops like cotton and jute. Some people argued that if we could produce more jute and cotton, we could find enough hard currency to import food grains. If not properly coordinated, this was a suicidal policy. He was, therefore, proposing a proper balance between the acreage of food and cash crops, and was appealing to the country to increase both. He wanted land, water and science to be placed in the hands of the farmer so that he could produce more.
Finally, he appealed to the business men gathered to contribute ₹15 each fat raising a tree at the sacred area of Somnath, which would prove a good augury for the “ grow more tree “ campaign he was asking the country to observe between July 1 and 7.

There was immediate response from the audience ang money for over 2,000 trees was promised.

Earlier, Mr M. R. Ruia, Vice-President of the Chamber, welcoming Mr Munshi voiced the general feeling that the statistics relating to grain shortage and grain yield forecasts were thoroughly unsatisfactory and that in spite of growing imports and the ever-mounting price of foreign food grains, there was still need for rationing and control. “

The large overseas purchase of grains have had a very adverse effect on the balance of trade position and, therefore, of payments, thus affecting even our trade policy regarding essential imports for raw materials.”
He urged more energetic steps to improve production and procurement, as also avoiding wastage. In this connection he referred to the recent recommendations of the Food Grains Investigation Committee and said that normal trade channels should be asked to fully shoulder the burden of distribution. He also criticized diversion of cash crop acreage to food grains, since he felt there was no substantial gain in this direction.

Mr Purshottamdas Thakurdas, who spoke after Mr Munshi, praised the Minister for his enormous drive and capacity to get things done and felt sure he would improve the country’s food position in a short time.

Mr Munshi said: “Since the birth of our freedom, our motherland has passed through crisis after crisis. The business community in Bombay, which had a great share in the freedom battle which we fought under Mahatma Gandhi, has felt the terrible effects of controls, of the economic crisis which followed World War II and the partition. You have been much maligned. Controls have deprived you of the benefits of natural trade channels. Some measures have even produced a sense of frustration. In spite of that you have been supporting the national Government with unflinching steadfastness. At the same time, I know that you fully realize the dangers through which we are passing spiraling inflation; post-war and post-partition problems; scarcity of food, cotton, jute and sugar; the problems of a growing population; the drawbacks of an economy which in parts is medieval; and the presence in our midst of a well-organized party which seeks to convert our economic misfortunes into the instruments of its subversive action.
","India's Food Minister, K. M. Munshi, outlined a four-point plan to achieve freedom from imports of foreign food by the end of 1951. The objectives included making India self-sufficient in food, integrating cotton and jute production with the ""grow more food"" campaign, and adopting austerity measures. Munshi emphasized reclaiming land, constructing tube wells, and increasing cereal, cotton, and jute production. He called for full cooperation, acknowledging the challenging task ahead. Munshi also addressed the need for correct statistical data, a balance between food and cash crops, and placing land, water, and science in the hands of farmers.

HT This Day: June 05, 1950 -- Division of railways into six zones
HT This Day: June 05, 1950 -- Division of railways into six zones
This is contained in a memorandum which, in accordance with the Railway Minister’s undertaking in Parliament, is being sent to commercial bodies and other public organizations for ascertaining their views.

Hindustan Times - your fastest source for breaking news! Read now.
It is proposed that the total mileage of Indian Railways-now about 33,000 -should be divided into six zones of administration as follows:

Zone .1.-Northern Railway: It will consist of the E. P. Railway, the western portion of the E. I. Rail. way between Lucknow-Kanpur and Delhi-Saharanpur, metre gauge portion of the B.B. & C.I. Railway between Agra and Kanpur and the O. T. Railway west of Chapra.

Zone 2.-Western Railway: It will consist of the metre gauge portion of the B.B. & C.I. Railway except Kanpur-Agra section and the States Railways of Saurashtra, Jodhpur. Bikaner. Jaipur, Rajasthan and Kutch. In this zone, consideration has been given to the development needs of Kandla Port and the business and economic connections of Saurashtra, etc., with Rajasthan.

Zone 3.-Central Railway: It will consist of the broad-gauge section of the B.B. & C.I. Railway, major portion of G.I.P. Railway, Scindia and Dholpur State Railways. In this zone not only the alternative routes from the major port of Bombay to Northern India, but also the lines of communication between Bombay and the industrial areas around it have been placed under one administration.

Zone 4-Southern Railway: It will consist of the S. I. Railway (both broad gauge and metre gauge), major portion (broad gauge) and entire portion (metre gauge) of the M. & S. M. Railway and the entire Mysore State Railway. Both geographically and from the railway operating point of view, grouping together of all the Southern Railways is the ideal arrangement.

Zone 5.-Eastern Railway: It will consist of the N.S. Railway, portions of the G. I. P. and M. & S. M Railways and the 8.N. Railway excluding the coalfield area of Bengal and Bihar and Howrah-Kharagpur section.

Zone 6.-North-Eastern Railway. I It will consist of the E.I. Railway east of Lucknow-Kanpur, the coalfield area of Bengal and Bihar at present with B. N. Railway, Howrah-Kharagpur section, O. T. Railway east of Chapra and the Assam Railway including the Assam Rail Link and the Darjeeling-Himalayan Railway.

OBSTACLES TO REGROUPING

The existing railway administrations have grown to haphazardly owing to historical reasons. The Company system had originally been formed more or less on accidental considerations. Often the main consideration was financial. There has been a persistent demand for rationalization and regrouping of the existing systems. So long as at the major railways had not come under State management this was not possible. The railways of Indian States cutting across the other railway administrations like that of the Nizam’s State Railway was another serious obstacle to rationalization, as also the existence of various small railway administrations owned and controlled by the Rulers of Indian States.

The partition of India in August, 1947. involved the breaking up of the old North-Western Railway and the Bengal-Assam Railway and India has been left with rumps of those systems in the Eastern Punjab Railway and the Assam Railway which cannot in any case continue as economic and self-sufficient units. The final integration of the Indian States Railways from April 1, 1950, as removed the major obstacle towards regrouping. The time is, therefore. fully ripe for reorganizing the Indian Railways on a rational basis.

The Railway Board have been considering this question for the past many months and have reached tentative conclusions. They realize. however, that the question is of such great importance that no final decision should be taken without giving the country and all interests concerned in railway transport ample opportunities for consideration and comment. The tentative scheme is, therefore, being released to the State Governments, the various Chambers of Commerce, the Railway labour organizations and the public with the request that their considered views may be sent to the Railway Board before August 31, 1950.

FOUR-FOLD PRINCIPLES

The main principles underlying the tentative scheme are four-fold:

(1) Every railway administration should serve as far as possible a compact region.

(2) It should be large enough to provide a headquarters organization of the highest caliber capable of following and assimilating up-to-date improvements in railway technique and equipped with adequate workshop facilities and statistical, training and research institutions.

(3) The regrouping should cause the minimum dislocation in the existing arrangements and should be so phased as to prevent any kind of dislocation or even temporary diminution of the quantity or efficiency of railway service.

(4) While the existing proposals do not indicate the nature of the internal administration of each group, viz., whether it should be on a Divisional or District System, it is not proposed to adopt any dogmatic attitude in the matter and the vital necessity of causing minimum dislocation will also govern the decision on this important issue.

The memorandum states:

The Government’s final proposals are expected to be ready when Parliament meets later in the year. It will be remembered that the Kunzru Committee recommended that the regrouping of Railways should be taken up after five years owing to the then unsettled conditions. The Government, however, feel that conditions are now very different from what they were at the time of the Kunzru Committee s report. It is felt that, with the integration of Indian State Railways on April 1. the time is now ripe for the regrouping of Indian Railways on a national basis.","On June 5, 1950, the Indian Government's tentative scheme for regrouping the country's railways was published. The scheme proposed dividing the Indian Railways' total mileage of about 33,000 into six zones: Northern, Western, Central, Southern, Eastern, and North-Eastern. Each zone was defined based on geographical and operational considerations. The memorandum containing the scheme was sent to commercial bodies and public organizations for their views, as per the Railway Minister's undertaking in Parliament. The scheme aimed to rationalize the existing railway systems, which had grown haphazardly due to historical reasons, and to create administrations that were more efficient and better equipped to handle modern railway techniques. The final proposals were expected to be ready for Parliament later in the year, with the government believing that conditions were now ripe for the regrouping of Indian Railways on a national basis.",Automotive,138,960

It was officially explained that this decision of India would make no difference to her attitude to the outstanding differences between Israel and the Arab States such as the question of the status of Jerusalem and Israel’s frontiers.

Hindustan Times - your fastest source for breaking news! Read now.
These questions, a Government spokesman said, would be judged purely on their merits.

Announcement of this important decision on the eve of the U.N General Assembly session at Lake Success and the Congress session at I Nasik is significant. The very fact that the Government of India have taken several months for coming to a decision shows the care with which they have considered all aspects of the problem including the international situation and the sentiments of Arab peoples.

It will be remembered that the Prime Minister, Pandit Nehru, stated in Parliament in February last that “the fact that the State of Israel exists is recognized by the Government of India, but formal recognition involving an exchange of diplomatic missions has to be considered in the context of a number of facts.”

Later in August, the Deputy Minister for External Affairs, Dr Keskar, explained that the international situation and other factors had to be taken into consideration with regard to the recognition of the Government of Israel. “ We are waiting,” he said, “ for an opportune moment for formal recognition of the Government of Israel.”

Over 40 States including two Muslim countries, Iran and Turkey, have already formally recognized the Government of Israel which was established nearly two years ago and became immediately a member of the U.N.

An official spokesman declared today that the decision to recognize the Government of Israel did not in any way affect India’s friendship with Egypt and the Arab States. India valued this friendship arid was anxious to promote it in every way. He also gave the assurance that India, having had to face the problem of refugees herself, realized the sufferings of Arab refugees and would continue to work for full justice and human treatment to Arab refugees and was also determined to exert his influence in U.N to secure justice for these refugees.

It was reported recently that the Government of Egypt sent a memorandum to the Government of India asking the latter not to recognize the Government of Israel. The Government of India have replied to this memorandum explaining their reasons for deciding to recognize Israel, Official circles are convinced that this decision, which has been taken on its merits after full consideration, will not in any way affect the friendly relations between India and Egypt and other Arab States. India and Egypt have differed over the Korean question and also the question of the recognition of the new People’s Government in China. These differences have not affected their friendly relations, and there is no reason why this recognition of Israel should have any adverse effect on their friendship.

The reasons which have prompted the Government of India to recognize the Government of Israel are very clear. First, the Government of Israel has been in existence for two years and there is no doubt it is going to stay. Second, India and Israel have been working together for the last two years in the U.N. and other international bodies, and Israel has been throughout this period collaborating with other members of the U.N. for furthering the cause of world peace and establishing better social and economic conditions in all parts of the world. According to an official spokesman, continuing natural non. recognition is not only inconsistent with the overall relationship but even limits the effectiveness of the Government of India’s role as a possible intermediary between Israel and the Arab States.” As in the case of China, India’s recognition of the Government of Israel amounts merely to the recognition of an established fact.

Inquiries show that the Government of India have at present no intention of sending a diplomatic representative to Israel This question will be taken up for consideration later, but at present the need for economy and the lack of trained personnel make it difficult for the Government of India to open new Embassies.","The Government of India announced its recognition of the Government of Israel, stating that it wouldn't affect relations with Egypt and Arab States. The decision came after careful consideration, acknowledging Israel's established status and collaborative efforts in international forums. India clarified that while recognizing Israel, it remained committed to supporting justice for Arab refugees.

MacArthur Massing Strength

Tokyo- North Korean forces stood and fought today for the first time since the South Korean forces crossed the 38th Parallel. They gave battle at a strategic point 80 miles north of the line.

In the central sector, where Gen. MacArthur was assembling his main forces, North Koreans were reported manning their old positions a few miles above the Parallel.

 In South Korea Communist guerillas, operating in groups of ten to 1,000, have increased their activity in the last 48 hours, according to U.S. intelligence officers.

A U.S. petrol van ran into a well-prepared ambush near the west coast recently. It was rescued by a column of infantry and tanks which fought off 300 Communists. Sabotage is continuing near the front lines, and mines have been placed on roads.

British infantry were flown north to just below the Parallel during the day, while the rest of the British Commonwealth Brigade in Korea which consists of two British battalions and one Australian—moved up by road.

Observers believed this hasty and expensive movement indicated that Gen. MacArthur was planning to order a composite force over the North-South Korean border soon. These would include the British Commonwealth troops, U.S. forces, already regrouped near the Parallel, and Fillipino troops who are expected to be moved up shortly.

The North Koreans, who have put up little opposition till now to the South Koreans’ advance into their territory, picked a point three miles north of Changjon to stand and fight today.

At this point the East Coast road is skirted by the sea and high mountains and the North Koreans had strong defence positions behind.

Frontline reports said about 2,250 Communists gave no ground on the East Coast road to Wonsan, through the Southerners brought up reinforcements and called in powerful air strikes.

The South Koreans were blocked by road mines and barbed wire in front of an extricate network of trenches in depth. The North Koreans were fighting bitterly.

The Southern Third Division which yeaterday captured Kosong, 55 miles north of the Parallel, almost unresisted, had exxprected a Communist stand another 30 miles on at Wonsan, one of the few major towns of northern Korea.

Some groups of well-equipped Communist troops up to 2,000 strong are reported still roaming the countryside, trying to break through to the North.

HT This Day: Nov 9, 1950 -- India willing to give asylum to Nepal ruler
It was disclosed today that the Government of India, in accordance with international usage, have agreed to give asylum to the King of Nepal and provided all facilities to him for coming to India, if he so desired. The King with some members of his family is reported to be still at the Indian Embassy at Kathmandu.

The Nepalese Ambassador called at the External Affairs Ministry today and had a talk with the Foreign Secretary, Mr K P. S. Menon.

The Government of India’s reactions to the unfortunate developments reported yesterday, particularly the deposition of the King and the installation of his three-year-old grandson, are reported to have been communicated to him.

Representatives of certain other foreign embassies in New Delhi, including the U.S.A. and Britain, also called at the Ministry to ascertain further particulars and discuss the situation.

These sudden developments in Nepal have undoubtedly great concern here. They are considered particularly unfortunate in view of the situation in Tibet owing to Chinese aggression and other international developments. There is a general desire that there should be a stable government in Nepal which would ensure peaceful progress.

As is well known, the Government of India have, on more than one occasion, urged the Nepal authorities to democratize the administration and do everything necessary to satisfy popular aspirations. They have been I repeatedly advised that it is no longer possible for them to ignore the people’s demand for responsible government in Nepal.

According to reports here, neither India nor the other Powers having diplomatic relations with Nepal are likely to be in a hurry to recognize the new three-year-old King who is reported to have been instated. They are likely to watch the situation for the present and also carefully study international practices in regard to this matter. Several questions need clarification- for instance, how far the deposition of the King is constitutional and legally justified, to what extent it is supported by the people of the State, whether the installation of the three-year-old grandson of the King by the Prime Minister and the group behind him is constitutionally proper, and what - the attitude of the deposed King is going to be.

It has already been reported that the differences between the King and the Prime Minister were partly due to the former’s support to the progressive group in the State and his desire to introduce responsibl4 government without further delay. This fact further complicates the problem, for as there has already been serious political discontent in the State owing to the absence of responsible government, the removal of the King who is known to be sympathetic to the demand for responsible government is bound- to have an adverse effect on the public mind.

The constitutional position in Nepal, which is rather peculiar and out of date, is largely responsible for the political discontent. The Prime Minister is the virtual ruler-holding all political and administrative powers in his hands. According :0 an agreement of 1846, the then head of the Rana family obtained from the sovereign the perpetual right to the office of Prime Minister. This right is still enjoyed by the descendants of the Rana family. This has not only reduced the King to the position of a mere figure-head but also stood in the way of rapid constitutional development for the democratization of the State. Suen constitutional reforms as have been announced have been far too meagre to satisfy the public.","New Delhi appears surprised by the recent coup in Nepal, despite prior knowledge of serious differences between the King and his Prime Minister. The Government of India has offered asylum to the King and his family, if they choose to come to India. The situation in Nepal has caused concern, especially given the instability in Tibet due to Chinese aggression. India has previously advised Nepal to democratize its administration. The legitimacy of the new three-year-old King and the constitutional aspects of the coup remain unclear, and international recognition of the new ruler is not expected immediately. The political discontent in Nepal is attributed to its outdated constitutional structure, which gives the Prime Minister extensive powers and limits the King's role.",Politics,120,689
Hindustan Times,1950-11-26 00:00:00,India gets a Constitution (1950),"India came into its own as a democratic republic on January 26, 1950 – a day celebrated since as Republic Day. It was the day India adopted its own Constitution, a text 145,000 words long, breathtaking in its intellectual expanse, and its imagination of a diverse and vibrant federal democracy. The Constitution was written by India’s finest minds, led by BR Ambedkar, with the Constituent Assembly sitting for 11 sessions, and 167 days over 2 years and 11 months.

The Constitution set the framework for India’s politics, adopting Universal Adult Franchise – the inalienable right of all citizens to vote and to participate in India’s democratic process. It also defined the relationship between the executive, legislature and the judiciary and gave to India a set of fundamental rights . The Preamble to the Constitution laid bare what India held dearest – that it was a sovereign, secular, democratic republic that believed in liberty of expression, belief, faith and worship, equality of status and opportunity.","In a historic moment on January 26, 1950, India adopted its Constitution, a pivotal step in its post-independence journey. The Constituent Assembly, led by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, meticulously crafted the document that would shape the nation's political, social, and economic landscape. The Constitution declared India a sovereign, socialist, secular, and democratic republic, embodying the diverse aspirations of its citizens.
This transformative document enshrined fundamental rights, providing citizens with protections against discrimination and upholding principles of justice and liberty. Alongside this, it incorporated Directive Principles of State Policy, guiding the government to work towards the welfare of the people and the establishment of a just society.

The Constitution established a federal structure, delineating powers between the central government and states. It introduced the position of the President, elected by an electoral college, as the ceremonial head of state. January 26, the day the Constitution came into effect, is celebrated annually as Republic Day, symbolizing the triumph of India's democratic values.The legacy of India's Constitution endures as the cornerstone of the nation's governance, guiding its evolution into the world's largest democracy and reflecting a commitment to justice, equality, and the protection of citizens' rights.",National News,192,164

After the funeral pyre was lighted by Sardar Patel’s son, Mr. Dahyabhai Patel, Mr. C. Rajagopalachari, Minister without Portfolio, Government of India, and the President, Dr Rajendra Prasad, made speeches paying tributes to the departed leader.

During the ten hours that Sardar Patel’s body remained with them, Bombay’s multitudes demonstrated the high esteem and great veneration in which the city in particular-his second home-and the country in general held Mahatma Gandhi’s right hand man.

As the common people mournfully filed past in an endless stream the Sardar’s body as it lay in state, planes were arriving every few minutes from different parts of the country carrying a cross-section of the country’s leadership and condolence messages from far and near poured in.

Then the last journey started at 5-20 p.m. along a four-mile route, with Maniben and Dahyabhai sitting on either side of the cortege and with the Sardar’s nearest colleagues immediately following in a jeep. Men of the Defence Services, so dear to him, brought up the rear of the procession.

All along the route men and women, cramming the footpaths, balconies and windows, chanted Gandhiji’s favourite prayer hymn “Raghupati-Raghava-Rajaram.” Flowers were showered on the cortege as it moved slowly along the narrow Vithalbhai Patel Road.

It was 7-20 p.m. when the procession reached the crematorium. The leaders took turns to carry on their shoulders their great comrade’s body on the last lap of the journey.

Twenty minutes later, at a spot adjacent to where his brother Vithalbhai’s ashes were mixed with the good earth, a pyre of sandalwood was going up in flames as the strains of “ Raghupati Raghava-Rajaram “ sung in chorus by Congress Desh Sevikas filled the air.

With that was becoming “air, earth and water,” what was Vallabhbhat Patel, the unflinching fighter, the great general, the sagacious administrator, the farsighted statesman and the architect of a united India.

PEACEFUL END

Sardar Patel was serene throughout the brave fight he put against death. His face looked majestic and peaceful notwithstanding the intense pain he underwent during the last few hours. The end came peacefully.

Sardar Patel went to Bombay on Tuesday on medical advice, as it was considered that the milder weather of Bombay as against the severe cold of Delhi, would be beneficial to him.

The change appeared to have done him considerable good and on Tuesday he was restful. He was also comfortable during the day on Wednesday, but from about 10 p.m. there was a setback and he was restless.

LUCKNOW- At 5 p.m. today the U.P. Assembly passed the Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Bill after struggling with it for two years, six months and four days. 

Hindustan Times - your fastest source for breaking news! Read now.
Cries of 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ and 'Kisan Mazdoor Raj Ki Jai' rang out from the Congress benches but the zamindar members, as was not unexpected, staged a walk-out as a protest against the passage of the Bill after Nawab Jamshed Ali Khan, their leader, had made a brief statement with the special permission of the Chair. 

Thirteen members belonging to all sections participated in today's final debate in this House on the Bill. Pandit Pant, who preceded the Revenue Minister Thakur Hukam Singh, proudly declared that this measure ensuring justice to all classes of people in the State was superior to the agrarian legislation in even Communist countries. He was obviously replying to the Socialist firebrand, Mr Raja Ram Shastri, who during an impassioned oratorical feat had declared that the Bill would not achieve its proclaimed object of zamindari abolition but would only consolidate feudalism and stem the kisan revolution. Mr Shastri had also said that the kisans would soon be disillusioned and would rise and really end zamindari. 

Pandit Pant in his speech revealed that compensation to the zamindars might be paid only in the shape of bonds ""considering present-day conditions."" 

The Bill, it may be mentioned, states that compensation will be paid in cash or bonds or partly in cash and party in bonds as may be prescribed. 

He said the Government's desire was to enforce the measure on Republic Day but it depended on the President whose assent to the measure had to be secured. The Centre was being posted with copies of the Bill from time to time and the Government hoped for the President's assent before January 26. 

PAYMENT OF COMPENSATION 

Here are the other points which the Chief Minister made: "" The Socialists are against compensation and the collection of 10 times the rent from the kisans for conferring on them bhumidhari rights. When the zamindari abolition resolution was passed by this House on August 8, 1946 nobody voiced against compensation. So compensation has to be given. Who will pay? Not the big zamindars who are losing their land. Not the townfolk who are not in the picture. Only the kisans whose rents will be halved after acquiring bhumidhari rights and who get the rights over the land have to pay. And nowhere has it been stated that the kisans must pay. If they pay their rents will be halved. If they do not they will continue to pay the same rent and will not be evicted from their lands though they will not enjoy the transfer rights. The landless labour will become the common owner of the uncultivated land in the village. I challenge anyone to produce a better Bill conferring better rights on the kisans. 

SYMPATHY WITH ZAMINDARS 

""My sympathies are with the zamindars who will be deprived of their standard of living they had been enjoying. But they should realize that people sacrifice their lives for the nation. For their material losses the Zamindars will gain in spiritual stature.  I appeal to them not to do anything which would leave a bad taste in the mouth. I pray that with the help of all the measure will be successfully enforced soon and the people of the State live a life of affectionate brotherhood and with peace and plenty for all."" 

Other speakers from the Congress benches were Mr Jagannath Prasad Agarwal, Prof. Krishen Chand and Mr R. N. Upadhyaya. 

The Revenue Minister who spoke for hardly five minutes (he began his speech at 4-55 p.m. and had to end it at the 5 p.m. deadline) thanked all for their help to him in getting through this gargantuan piece of legislation. 

Because he had forgotten to include the Press in the list of officials and non-officials and colleagues who had been with him at the job, he specially called them, regretted the omission and expressed his gratitude to them for all they had done during the past two and a half years. 

P.T.I. adds: The Bill will now go for the second time to the Upper House for the consideration of one amendment made in the Assembly. After the Bill is passed by the Upper House on January 15, it will be sent to the President for his assent.","The Uttar Pradesh Assembly passed the Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Bill after a lengthy struggle of two years, six months, and four days. The bill faced opposition from zamindar members, who staged a walkout in protest. Congress members celebrated the bill's passage with cries of 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' and 'Kisan Mazdoor Raj Ki Jai.'

The main Communist force was, however, believed to have retreated completely and in good order. Military observers here discounted any suggestion that the Communists had been routed. The had merely withdrawn to fresh defence lines.

NAVAL ACTIVITY

Information at the H.Q. put the spotlight on naval and air activity. The world’s biggest battleship Mighty Mo - the U.S.A.’s 45.000 ton Missouri- went into action again today after her recent major overhaul in Japan. She hurled 16-inch shells into Chonjin, important rail-road junction only 50 miles south of the Siberian border.

Guns of Allied cruisers, destroyers and frigates pounded for the 26th day the North Koreans’ major port of Wonsan on the east coast.

The Committee has also, for the sake of clarification, recommended the addition of a new clause (4) to Article 15 where it thinks it would be preferable to refer to “the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens,"" instead of referring to “the educational, economic .or social advancement of any backward class of citizens.""

While some apprehensions have been expressed in respect of this amendment, the Committee feels this provision "" is not likely to be, and cannot indeed be, misused by any Government for perpetuating any class discrimination against the spirit of the Constitution, or for treating non-backward classes as backward for the purpose of conferring privileges on them.""

ANOTHER CHANGE

Another change proposed by the Select Committee relates to future legislation providing, for acquisition of estates. In this clause the Committee has made two amendments- one, to the effect that wher6 the law is made by a State Legislature, it should be reserved for the consideration of the President and should receive his assent before the law could claim the protection given to it by the new Article. The other amendment merely seeks the definition of “estate” to cover existing laws which have been enacted in Hindi or Urdu and where the equivalent of “estate “in the local language has been used.

The only other Change made by the Committee is that even where the first session of Parliament or State Legislature after a general election happens to be the second session in that year there should be provision for an address by the President or the Governor. The original amendment made provision for the address only for the first session of each year.

MINUTES OF DISSENT

P.T.I. adds:

Mrs Durga Bai in her minute of dissent has suggested the power to restrict the freedom of speech and expression proposed to be given under the new clause 19(2) should be vested in Parliament alone, to the exclusion of the State Legislatures.

She says: "" I feel there is considerable force in the criticism that in regulating the freedom of speech and expression, uniformity of laws can be secured only if the legislative decisions are taken by Parliament. Further the present amendment authorizes the curtailment of this freedom in the interest, inter alia of friendly relations with foreign States which obviously is a subject falling entirely and exclusively in the legislative ambit of the Union. The substitution of the word ' Parliament ' for the word ' State ' in the clause will ensure to Parliament the exclusive power of abridging the fundamental right of freedom of speech in the plenitude of its wisdom.""

The argument that the change suggested would entail revision or interference with the legislative lists, she says, has no basis. After referring to the difference provided in the Constitution for amendment for the legislative lists and certain other articles and an amendment of the fundamental rights chapter, she says: "" It is obvious no clause on the fundamental rights can he amended without restricting or enlarging the scope of the legislative power of Parliament or the State legislatures*

PUBLIC APPREHENSIONS

Pointing out the many instances in the fundamental rights chapter where Parliament had been given exclusive jurisdiction, she says "" On the other hand, to include the new items, public order, maintenance of friendly relations with foreign States, does justify the apprehension that these extensions may result m serious encroachments on the liberty of person. and the Press, specially at the time of elections. There are going to be tens of thousands of polling stations and even after the general election, there will be about 100 by-elections every year. It will be open to any State legislature to abridge the freedom of the Press and the public and then take the chance of being overruled by Parliament. ""

No other reason can be or has been assigned for opposing this suggestion which, I believe, will go a long way towards allaying public apprehensions so vigorously and vehemently voiced by powerful sections of the Press that the extensive power of control over the fundamental right of freedom of speech and expression might be abused by some of the State legislatures. There is no more effective remedy for dispelling such apprehensions than the conferment upon Parliament the exclusive right 'to exercise that control in the manner suggested by me.""

NO CONVINCING CASE

Pandit II. N. Kunzru in his minute of dissent says Government have not established "" any clear and convincing case for the proposed amendments."" The Constitution had been in force only for 16 months and general elections would be taking place in a few months and yet Government "" propose to force these amendments to the Constitution through Parliament immediately.""

“It is a matter of deep regret."" he continues, "" that Government should not have given to the Committee full information in regard to the laws that had become void as a result of the recent Judicial pronouncements and that are to be validated though they were repeatedly asked to place before the Committee a clear picture of the position created by the decisions.""

Pandit Kunzru has recalled that in the case of "" Brig. Bhushan vs the Delhi State,"" the Supreme Court had held there could be no pre-censorship of news while in the case of "" Romesh Thapar vs. Madras State."" the order banning the entry and circulation of The Cross Roads into Madras in the interests of public order were considered unconstitutional.

"" Is it the intention of Government to validate the exercise of these powers by the State?"" he asked.

After referring to the fact that in Master Tara Singh's case Sections 124 A and 153 A of the Penal Code had been declared ultra vires, Pandit Kunzru says, "" The history of Section 124 A is well known. It was passed in its present form in 1898 to curb the activities of Indian patriots. While in England sedition is treated as a minor offence, in India it is regarded as a major offence for which severe punishment can be imposed. Now that India is free it should find no place in a statute book in its existing form.""

IMPORTANT CHANGE

Welcoming the use of the word "" reasonable ""' before "" restrictions,"" he says it introduces * a very important change "" and places in the hands of the judiciary the power to determine whe. ther a restrictive legislation is reasonable or not.

Referring to the retrospective validation of the laws, he says "" Government should give an assurance that no one will be prosecuted for having acted in contravention of these laws while they were invalid.""

In regard to the amendment to article 15, Pandit Kunzru says: "" I think a central authority should determine which classes should be regarded as backward so that a uniform standard may be observed in respect of the specification of such classes pending the report of the Commission referred to in article 340 of the Constitution. A provision similar to the one contained in 341 and 342 of the Constitution is necessary to enable the President to decide which classes should be regarded as backward.""

Mookerjee'S CRITICISM

Dr S. P. Mookerjee in his minute of dissent has questioned the need for the further restrictions on the freedom of speech. He has supported Mrs Durga Bal's suggestion the power to impose such restrictions should be vested only in Parliament.

Dr Mookerjee says the onus of proving the need for changes had not been "" satisfactorily discharged "" by the proposers of the amendments. The procedure adopted indicates "" how the Constitution is being denied its inherent sanctity and sacredness.""

The main ' reason advanced for the amendments was that the judiciary had pronounced its opinion on certain laws which were disfavoured by the Government in power. Though the members of the Select Committee repeatedly asked for it, they had not been furnished with the list of laws which had been declared invalid and which created dif6culties for Government.

The judiciary having been clothed with the duty of ensuring that the laws conform to the Constitution "" nothing should be done to impair, the independence of the judiciary or To lower its prestige."" Instead of bringing the old "" repressive and retrograde "" laws in line with the fundamental rights of the Constitution, "" we are following the strange procedure of adhering to such reactionary laws and changing our fundamental rights.""

WHOLESOME CHANGE

Welcoming the use of the words * reasonable restrictions "" in the proposed Article 19(2), Dr Mookerjee says it is ""a wholesome change."" making 19(2) Justiciable and "" I do not wish to minimize the importance of this change in the protection of civil liberty."" The existing restrictions on the right to free speech and expression are "" more than sufficiently restrictive "" and there should be no fresh additions to these the only lacuna, if at all, is that limitations did not cover "" incitement to violence "" and this might be removed, but there is no justification for "" forging fresh fetters."" The term "" public order "" used in the amendment is vague and should be subject to "" the clear and present danger test,"" namely, that the substantive evil must be extremely serious and the degree of imminence extremely high.

FOREIGN STATES

Dr Mookerjee says there is no justification for bringing in the unrestricted provision of ""friendly relations with foreign States."" At the most, the phrase should not extend beyond defamatory attacks on heads of foreign States or similar acts. Though the Government agreed to this principle, it is not prepared to make it clear and unambiguous in the Constitution itself.

Pointing out that the State legislatures, under the proposed amendments. would be able to exercise powers at protecting the rights and liberties of the people. resulting in "" conflicting approaches "" Its different States. Dr Mookerjee says: "" These laws, at least those relating to the restrictions of fundamental rights, should be framed by Parliament and not by the State legislatures.""

Referring to the retrospective character of the amendment, he says: "" This is most undesirable and may theoretically clothe the Government with the authority to launch prosecutions for alleged offences committed during a period when the laws were void according to court decisions."" The Prime Minister and the Home Minister, he adds, have assured this was not the Government’s intention and instructions would be issued to the State Governments accordingly, if necessary. "" Still the dangerous implications of such retrospective legislation cannot be minimized.""

NEW ARTICLES 31-A & B

In regard to the new Article 31-A and 31-B. Dr Mookerjee says the Patna Act had been declared invalid by the High Court as a violation of Article 14. If the Government appealed to the Supreme Court, and if it gave a verdict not acceptable to the Government, that could have been a justification for amending the Constitution. But nothing had as yet happened to justify the taking away of the jurisdiction of the judiciary in this sweeping manner. At least the wording of Article 31-A should be so modified that the responsibility to see that the provisions of Article 31 were complied with, should vest in the President.

As regards 31-B, some of the laws proposed to be validated are pending before the courts. To include in the Constitution itself particular laws which had been deliberately declared invalid by the judiciary was "" an extraordinary procedure."" The laws should at least be carefully tested again by the President to see that they do not violate the provisions of the Constitution. Only thereafter should they be declared valid.

So long as they had a written constitution and fundamental rights, they have to abide by its provisions No Government could afford to brush them aside or hurriedly seek their alteration on the plea that judicial interpretations are not to its liking. "" A better and more honourable course would have been not to have a written constitution at all and make Parliament the supreme body.""

MINUTES OF DISSENT

Three members, Prof. K. T. Shah. Sardar Hukam Singh and Mr Naziruddin Ahmad, have submitted a joint minute of dissent and also separate ones.

They say the experience gained in the working of the Constitution was too short and too few to warrant the conclusion that an amendment was needed.

Amendment of the Constitution by the present Parliament was open to question on grounds of propriety if not of constitutionality. With elections barely six months off the proposed amendment could hardly be said to be in the best traditions of constitutional progress, democratic ideas or of effective popular sovereignty.

The three members have also voiced the complaint that the Committee did not have sufficient material before them and they did not also have the text of the laws which were to be validated.

Amendment to Article 15 was "" objectionable as being incompatible with the letter and spirit of the Constitution.' Though the entire population of the country could be said to be backward, certain so-called backward classes were being selected for special treatment "" Those in power arid authority have done nothing hitherto to implement any important article in the chapter on the directives of policy, which breathe the spirit of the Constitution, even though somewhat asthmatically.""

NEW RESTRICTIONS

Far more objectionable, they say, is the proposed amendment to Article 19. At least three new categories have been introduced, while those already in the article have been in some respects materially modified. In the amendment as it now stood the term "" reasonable is added before "" restrictions."" To this extent it is a welcome improvement. "" We, however, see no justification for ' including ' friendly relations ' with foreign States to restrict, however reasonably, freedom of speech and expression."" The Press in India as a whole has shown no evidence to justify this wholly gratuitous and unwarrantable restriction on civil liberties.

As regards the proposed new Article, 31-A, special consideration is shown to owners of landed property, namely, reserving a Bill for consideration by the President and for his assent, it is sought to abolish land ownership or, corresponding rights in land. But no such consideration will be shown to any Bill aimed at restricting civil liberty. particularly in regard to freedom of speech and expression.

Mr Naziruddin Ahmad, in his additional minute of dissent, says: "" Up to 8-45 a.m. on May 25 I have not, and so far as I could ascertain, no other member of the Select Committee has seen the actual text of the Bill as finally settled by the Select Committee after several revisions. This has acted as an additional handicap in the way of drawing up any accurate and up-to-date dissentient note.""

THE ECONOMICALLY BACKWARD

Mr Ahmed has suggested that besides the advancement of socially and educationally backward classes of citizens provided for in the new Article 15(4), the advancement of the economically backward classes also should be provided.

Referring to the argument of Dr Ambedkar in the House, that the Supreme Court should have imported the principle of "" police powers of the State "" in interpreting the Constitution. Mr Ahmad has said that the Court had correctly interpreted the Constitution. The police powers of the State flowed from the use of the words "" due process of law "" in the U.S. Constitution, and this had not found a place in the Indian Constitution.

In regard to Article 19(2), the words "" incitement to offence "" were too vague and go too far. Even under the I.P.C . which had stood the test of over 90 years, mere incitement to offence was not an offence unless it was followed by a criminal act. Only emergency legislations provided for this offence.

Another serious fault in the proposed Article 19(2) was that it empowers legislation to punish defamatory at, tacks on foreign States and also anything which impairs friendly relations with foreign States. The power sought presently went too far and might be used too easily to prohibit and punish ordinary and fair criticism of foreign affairs. Again, any fair and outspoken criticism might be made punishable by law.

Unfortunately, the existing penal and other laws had not been adapted to bring them in line with the Constitution. If this had been done there will be a clearer picture. By reviving the obsolete and dead laws with retrospective effect, their real shape and effect could not be known with any certainty or exactitude.

LAND QUESTION

In regard to the new Article 31-A, Mr Ahmad says the principle of the clause is widely accepted but the crucial test is payment of adequate or proper compensation as admitted by the Prime Minister himself in Parliament. But the revival of all existing laws, whether good or bad in that respect, is being attempted. ""

This is utterly expropriatory and shows high-handedness and would serve as a warning to owners of other properties and business of their approaching fate. The result will be widespread panic and uncertainty rendering industrialization of the country a difficult process.

By introducing the Ninth Schedule, reviving all dead and half-dead enactments, irrespective of their propriety or adequacy, "" Parliament is asked to put rubber stamp certificates of fitness to them without examining their contents."" Some - alarming examples "" of injustice and arbitrariness brought to light in the Acts and which should be condemned "" outright as outrageous "" are going to be "" sanctified "" by the validation process and it could never be justified on any grounds of principle or policy.

The entire Bill was hastily conceived and was being rushed through Parliament without proper or satisfactory scrutiny by the public.

HUKAM SINGH'S NOTE

Sarder Hukam Singh in his separate minute of dissent has said that the Constitution was made the touchstone to test the laws. Instead of changing the old repressive and defective laws, the Constitution is now sought to be amended. While the use of the word * reasonable "" is welcome, the scope of limitations is still too wide.

The amendment proposed to Article 15 indirectly amends Article 20 (2) and this is beyond the scope of the Select Committee. The present amendment will leave very wide scope to the State legislatures and consequently to the executive to corrupt the list of backward classes by including groups that were not backward.

Sarder Hukam Singh has also objected to the amendment to Article 19(6). While he accepted the principle of the State carrying on trade or business, h,(r referred to instances in U.P. and Bombay, where, while bus owners had been deprived of their right to carry on trade, their vehicles had not been taken over. This was a device to get over the clear provisions of law allowing compensation to them. The Allahabad and Bornbay High Courts had given some relief to them. Under the present amendment they would be completely out of court and entirely at the mercy of the executive.

K. T. SHAH'S NOTE

Prof. K. T. Shah, in his minute of dissent, says that Article 31 A by restricting its scope to proprietorial or analogous rights in land as against the scope of Article 31 which extends to landed as well as personal wealth in commerce and industry, creates "" a needless and unjustifiable discrimination which is de8nitely against the spirit of the Constitution, aiming at an egalitarian society.""

Again, while bills relating to landed rights were to be reserved for consideration of the President, no such safeguards were being provided for the protection of civil liberties when threatened by State legislation.

The proposal to validate all the laws mentioned in the schedule was open to fundamental objection. Not all of them had been declared invalid by courts and none of them had been examined' by the Select Committee. To declare the summarily valid and give them protection en bloc is a dangerous precedent.

The new additions by the Committee to Articles 31-A and 31-B made no provision to guard against the entire purpose of such legislation being defeated by the setting up of smaller and more tenacious landlord or peasant proprietors. Unless the dispossession of large landlords was accompanied by a simultaneous nationalisation of land permitting collective or at least co-operative cultivation, there would be no real benefit from the amendment.

The provision authorizing the summoning of either House of Parliament was not only unnecessary but was likely to pave the way for a presidential dictatorship.

The proposed amendment enabling the appointment of non-citizens to high judicial office in the Union, including the office of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court was objectionable both on grounds of national self-respect as well as the limited number of persons for whom the amendment appears to have been proposed. It was said there were only four non-citizens who would be benefited. ""

I see no reason why these persons should not acquire Indian citizenship if they desire to serve this country in such exalted positions,"" Prof Shah concludes.","The Select Committee on the Constitution (First Amendment) Bill presented its report to Parliament. The report included six minutes of dissent, with notable objections raised by Dr S. P. Mookerjee and Pandit Kunzru. The Committee recommended adding the qualification ""reasonable"" before restrictions on freedom of speech, giving the judiciary power to determine if legislation is reasonable. It also suggested clarifying language in Article 15 regarding socially and educationally backward classes. Dissenting members expressed concerns over the need for amendments, the retrospective nature of the changes, and the potential for abuse of power by State legislatures. They also criticized the broad scope of restrictions on freedom of speech and expression.",Politics,109,3673
Hindustan Times ,1951-08-02 00:00:00,General elections in January,"Mr Sukumar Sen, Chief Election Commissioner, said in Delhi yesterday the people in Himachal Pradesh and the mountainous regions of Punjab and U.P. would go to the polls in October though the general elections in the rest of the country would begin in the first week of January and would be completed within three weeks. Mr Sukumar Sen, Chief Election Commissioner, said in Delhi yesterday the people in Himachal Pradesh and the mountainous regions of Punjab and U.P. would go to the polls in October though the general elections in the rest of the country would begin in the first week of January and would be completed within three weeks.The final decision was reached following correspondence between him and the Government on the subject but a notification of the actual dates of polling would be issued a few weeks later. The President is likely to refer to the new dates of elections in his address to Parliament, inaugurating its autumn session.

Early elections in Himachal Pradesh and the hilly tracts of Punjab are necessitated by the fact that the I regions will be snowbound during winter and polling will be impossible.

Himachal Pradesh will have to return three members to the House of the People and elect 37 members to the electoral college of the: State on the basis of adult suffrage. The elections will be held simultaneously.

The Himalayan region of Punjab has one representative in Parliament and seven in the State Assembly. In accordance with statutory provisions, a notification of election dates must be issued at least 48 days before polling takes place and the Election Commissioner is therefore expected to request the President to issue a notification before I the end of this month or by he first week of September.

It was originally expected polling would be spread over two months, November and December, but the dates have been deferred to January, 1952. in response to a request by more than five major states but the polling is expected to be completed within three weeks.

The State Governments have been directed to inform the Chief Election Commissioner about suitable dates of polling in their respective States and their polling programmes. On receipt of such advice only, the Election Commission would advise the President to ‘ issue a notification of the actual lection dates in various parts of India. Polling programme can be drawn only on the strength of the final publication of the delimitation of constituencies and the electoral rolls. The delimitation of the constituencies as finally modified and approved by Parliament is expected to be published within a week. soon I after the return to New Delhi of the Speaker. Mr Mavlankar. The final publication of the electoral rolls will take place before the end of this month.

In the meantime, the Election Commission will shortly appoint electoral registration officers-men who will be in charge of the electoral rolls constituency-wise. Certain Government servants and district authorities will be specifically authorized to do this additional work. Along with their appointment. returning officers for each constituency will be appointed on the recommendation of the State Governments. It will be the responsibility of the State Governments to appoint necessary polling officers and presiding officers. It is expected these preliminary steps will be completed in a month or two. The draft rules under the Representation of the Peoples Act-the principal electoral Act providing for the qualification of candidates. conduct of elections. freedom of voting, etc.-have been completed and the State Governments are now being consulted on the subject.

An important provision under the rules related to the maximum expenditure a candidate can spend on the election. The sum will, however,’ be finally determined by the Central Government, and the draft provision is considered tentative.

With the finalization of the rules, along with the publication of the electoral rolls, and delimitation of constituencies, the machinery for the conduct of the elections and the regulations governing them are considered as being completed.

The delimitation of constituencies for the Upper House in the Centre has now been undertaken by the Chief Election Commissioner. The electoral colleges in “ Part C “ States for electing members to the Council of States will themselves be constituted on the basis of adult franchise.

In regard to Upper Houses in the States too constituencies have yet to be delimited by the Chief Election Commissioner.

The proposed legislative measure in respect of the powers of the electoral colleges in Part C States may affect to some extent the polling programme in these areas.

Mr Sen anticipated the counting of votes in the general elections will last up to the middle of February. Only after the election results are announced can the Upper Houses both in the Centre and the States be constituted and Presidential election take place. This process will mean the Presidential election will be held either in March or early April 1952 at the earliest. As the President has to summon the new Parliament, the newly constituted House of the People and the Council of States are unlikely to meet before May next. It is stated the present Parliament will therefore sit for the budget session in February-March next to deal with the budget for 1952-53 and will possibly vote the grants on credit.

The Law Ministry, it is stated, will introduce a Bill during the forthcoming session of Parliament relating to procedure in respect of Presidential election.","Chief Election Commissioner Mr. Sukumar Sen announced that general elections in India would commence in the first week of January and be completed within three weeks. However, Himachal Pradesh and mountainous regions of Punjab and Uttar Pradesh would hold early elections in October due to winter snow. Himachal Pradesh would elect three members to the House of the People and 37 members to the State electoral college. The Election Commission would issue specific polling dates later. Delimitation of constituencies, electoral rolls, and election rules were being finalized. Vote counting was expected to continue until mid-February, with Presidential elections possibly occurring in March or early April 1952. The new Parliament would likely convene in May. A new legislative measure would impact the polling program in Part C States, and a Bill related to the Presidential election procedure would be introduced during the upcoming Parliament session.",Politics,144,903

The Education Minister, opening the Indian Institute of Technology here today, said the main function of the institute would be to provide facilities for training high grade engineers and technologists. The institution would have provision for the teaching of 2,000 students at the under-graduate level, and 1,000 students for post-graduate study and research.

Hindustan Times - your fastest source for breaking news! Read now.
The institution, he added, was beginning with only a little over 200 under-graduates and a few research students, but he could visualize the day when its potentialities would be fully realized.

Maulana Azad said the policy of the Government was to so improve the facilities for higher technical education in the country that they could themselves meet most of their needs. They had, therefore, decided that facilities in different subjects would be made available at the institute only when the Government was satisfied that properly qualified and experienced personnel had been secured to run the courses and that the industrial and technical development of the country needed the provision of such courses.

He said the Government had already before them a scheme for establishing four institutions of the standard of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A scheme, costing ₹1.5 crores, had also been sanctioned for strengthening and improving the 14 engineering and technological institutions situated in the different parts of the country and it was in the third year of its operation.

The Minister made a special appeal to industrial and business magnates to take an active interest in ‘he development of technical institutions.

The West Bengal Governor, Dr Katju, who presided, expressed the hope the institute would meet the national needs in the shape of technical education. It was appropriate, he said, the location of the institute should be at Kharagpur in Midnapore district, which had played an immortal part in the struggle for independence. Dr J. C. Ghosh Director of the Institute, assured its founders they would not spare any effort to fulfil their high expectations. He hoped the education here would imbue the students with the principles of social justice so that they served their country not only by expert counsels in their own fields but also as leaders in community enterprises.

He dispelled the doubts expressed in certain quarters that the institute could not properly function in the isolation of Kharagpur. He reminded the critics the place was very near to the largest railway workshop in India, as also the industrial town of Jamshedpur, I which they intended to make full use of.

In a message on the occasion, Mr N. R. Sarkar, Finance Minister. of West Bengal, who was absent due to indisposition, said they were today taking a step forward and this he hoped would usher in an era of technology.","Maulana Azad, the Education Minister, emphasized the government's commitment to advancing technical education in India during the opening of the Indian Institute of Technology. The institute aimed to train high-grade engineers and technologists, initially accommodating over 200 undergraduates and a few research students, with plans for growth. The government's strategy included improving facilities for technical education to meet the country's needs and establishing institutions equivalent to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

“ All that we want,” said the Home Minister explaining the object of the Bill, “ is that no newspaper should write so as to encourage the breakdown of law and order or say things to encourage crime.”

Hindustan Times - your fastest source for breaking news! Read now.
He made it clear that the Bill was aimed not at the Press as a whole, but against those “ few who may commit the serious breaches referred to.” He added in his characteristic way: “ I do want it to scare away bad people.”

The Home Minister’s speech, impressive in its eloquence and scintillating with good humour, will go down in Parliamentary history as the most brilliant exposition of the philosophy of Press freedom and the law governing the written word. At the end of the debate the House passed the motion for referring the Bill to a select committee with almost a unanimous voice.

Mr Rajagopalachari said he was only anxious to ban a law comprising the essential “ don’ts for printed stuff.” He told the House: “ If it is there, with courts to guard the canons of just and fair interpretation of whatever is printed or complained about, a code of conduct for all sections of the Press of our country will grow out of it.”

ANSWER TO CRITICS

The Home Minister replied sharply to those who opposed the Bill as unnecessary. “ These editors,” he said, “ will not themselves or cannot control their erring colleagues. and they will not also allow Parliament and the courts when occasion arises to warn them, not to speak of punishing them. This is the meaning of opposition to the Bill.” Be reminded the House that in all civilized countries, certain minimum restraints were cheerfully accepted by the free Press in the interests of order and peaceful progress.

Explaining the need for a special law. he declared with firmness: “We cannot afford to let people’s minds be poisoned.” He explained in detail why the ordinary law was “ inadequate and inapplicable in such cases.”

The Home Minister also replied to those who complained that as a result of the Bill, the credit of India abroad was being damaged.

“No one is led to think that the Press in India is less free than the Press in any other country,” be said. Facts spoke for themselves They had only to look at newspapers in the country to judge and see for themselves that “ the Press in India is today freer than at any time before and freer than the Press in most other countries.”

“I may make it clear that no fair comment or bona fide criticism of the system of Government. of Government measures of the administration, of the laws passed or even of the Constitution would come within the terms of any of the items of objectionable mater dealt with in the Bill,” he declared.

The Home Minister asked the House: “Are we to trust no one in the world but a free Press ? It we do not trust a High Court, a tribunal or a jury, I say positively, I cannot trust you -a free Press. I maintain my point as quite sound.”

Mr Rajagopalachari said the Government had not abandoned the idea of appointing a Press commission, but it had nothing to do with the subject-matter of the Bill. The Commission would take a year if not more, to complete its task","The seven-day debate on the Press Laws Bill concluded in Parliament with Home Minister Mr. Rajagopalachari defending the measure. He assured the press of their freedom but emphasized the need for safeguards against abuse of freedom leading to chaos. The Bill aimed to prevent newspapers from encouraging lawlessness or crime. Rajagopalachari clarified that the Bill targeted a few offenders, not the entire press. His speech, praised for its eloquence and humor, highlighted the importance of a code of conduct for the press. The House passed the motion to refer the Bill to a select committee almost unanimously. Rajagopalachari rejected criticism that the Bill was unnecessary, emphasizing that minimum restraints were accepted by free presses worldwide for peaceful progress. He also addressed concerns about India's international image, stating that the Indian press was freer than ever. He affirmed that fair comments or criticism of the government, laws, or the constitution would not be restricted by the Bill.

The Times of India,1951-10-21 00:00:00,The Bharatiya Jana Sangh is founded (1951),"One of the parties that contested the first general election was the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, founded in October 1951. The Sangh was the precursor to the Bharatiya Janata Party, and led by Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, who had served in Nehru’s interim cabinet. It adopted an eight point programme that has remained at the party’s ideological core, including the imagination of an Akhand Bharat, the rejection of ‘appeasement’ towards Pakistan, decentralization of industry, and an independent-- as opposed to non-aligned-- foreign policy. The party remained a fringe player for the first decade, winning three and four seats in 1952 and 1957. Among those four representatives was a young Atal Bihari Vajpayee.","Founded on October 21, 1951, the Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS) marked the inception of a political party that would later play a crucial role in the shaping of India's political landscape. Established by Syama Prasad Mookerjee, the BJS was formed in response to perceived ideological gaps and the need for an alternative political platform.

The party was rooted in the principles of cultural nationalism, emphasizing the preservation of Indian culture and heritage. It found support among those advocating for the interests of Hindus and promoting a unified national identity. Over time, the BJS evolved as a right-wing political force, aligning with broader conservative values.

The Bharatiya Jana Sangh later became a key player in the formation of the Janata Party in the 1970s, contributing to the broader coalition that opposed the Emergency imposed by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Eventually, the BJS transformed into the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which went on to become a major political force in India, forming governments at the national level.

EMS Namboodripad, who was elected the chief minister was a former Congressman .

The government would last only two years, and it would also become the first government dismissed by invoking Article 356. The EMS government’s policies such as land reforms and regulation of educational institutions triggered a huge backlash from the propertied classes in the newly formed state. The protest which is also called the Liberation Struggle in Kerala had myriad sections including the Catholic Syrian Church, Muslim league and the landed castes such as Nairs","In a historic electoral triumph, Kerala, a state in southern India, witnessed the formation of the world's first democratically elected communist government in 1957. The Communist Party of India (CPI) won a decisive victory in the state legislative elections held in February. Led by E.M.S. Namboodiripad, the government assumed office on March 5, 1957. This marked an unprecedented event in global political history, as a communist party peacefully ascended to power through democratic means.

The government prioritized land reforms, aiming to address socio-economic inequalities. The pioneering administration focused on education, healthcare, and social justice, leaving a lasting impact on Kerala's development trajectory. Despite facing challenges and being dismissed in 1959, the election and governance of the first communist government in Kerala became a significant milestone, showcasing the viability of communist parties participating and succeeding in democratic processes.",Politics,137,132
Hindustan Times,1955-08-18 00:00:00,"HT This Day: August 18, 1955 -- Beginning of the epic march","News was available here today that Goans, including prominent citizens, inside Goa repeatedly offered satyagraha on August 15 despite the imposition of martial law there and that there were also large-scale demonstrations by the people.News was available here today that Goans, including prominent citizens, inside Goa repeatedly offered satyagraha on August 15 despite the imposition of martial law there and that there were also large-scale demonstrations by the people.According to the statements, which were by and large identical about 70 Goans, who offered satyagraha in batches of six, were arrested and released later, but not before they had been given severe beatings. They were, of course, apart from the hundreds of satyagrahis who crossed the border in the teeth of bullets and batons.

Great importance attaches to the disclosure inasmuch as the Portuguese authorities have been tr)4ng to mislead world opinion by saying that the people inside Goa are not behind the freedom struggle. Dispatches appearing in some of the foreign papers have also been referring only to satyagraha by persons from outside.

Reports of the demonstrations inside Goa also give some details of the fast-moving scene there.

According to a P.T.I. message received late tonight from Belgaum, Portuguese police opened fire on villagers of Hedus, about half a mile inside Sasoli border, because they co-operated with Indian satyagrahis who entered the village on August 15. The satyagrahis occupied the village for seven and a half hours hoisted the Indian Bag and declared the village’s merger with India.Fire was also opened on Tuesday by Portuguese police on the people of Ibrahimpur who had hoisted the Indian flag and declared themselves free from foreign rule.

A message from Karwar says 36 Goans offered satyagraha in batches in Margao, chief commercial centre of Goa on August 15. A batch of seven took out a procession from the Margeo railway station to the cloth market.A crowd of over 3,000 witnessed the batches of satyagrahis who shouted anti-Portuguese slogans and attempted to hoist the Indian Bag at various places. The satyagrahis were arrested and severely beaten during and after arrest.

The statements by Mr Nehru and Pandit Pant said the Goans offered satyagraha in and around Marmagoa, Goa’s capital. They carried the Indian flag. They were beaten severely, both before and after the arrest
SATYAGRAHA DETAILS

There were demonstrations throughout the day and satyagraha was repeatedly offered in the market place, near the municipal hall, near the model school and in the public maidan, they added.

Indian flags were put up by the citizens at many places. Posters and handbills saying “Jai Hind” and “ Viva Goa “ were distributed widely.The statements, it was pointed out, were based on lengthy, telephonic reports received by the Government of India from the Bombay Government.

The Prime Minister and the Home Minister also gave fuller details regarding the satygrahis who had entered Goa on August 15.

According to information received, 1,711 persons had entered Goa on that day. The total number accounted for was 1,601, including a few bodies of those who had fallen. The total number of the missing was 20 some of whom had perhaps been shot down. Others were detained, or in hospital in Goa.

On the Daman border, 1,249 persons had gone in and 1,244 had come back, including seven injured. There were four persons missing and one dead. The most authentic information reaching the Government showed that 14 persons had died in all. They presumed that six or seven more had died although there was no authentic information about it. Thirteen persons were severely wounded and 24 missing.MISLEADING REPORTS

The Home Minister also referred to reports spread by interested parties that Indian troops were on the border. He said: “It has been reported, presumably on information given by the Portuguese authorities that the Indian Army has assembled on the borders of Goa. This is utterly false and unfounded. The report, I am afraid, has been circulated deliberately to mislead world opinion.”

A report in one of the London papers said on August 15 that “reaction here (in Goa) to the Indian blockade, which is having a serious effect on the economy, is becoming increasingly bitter.” Comments in the lobbies were that if the Government of India had not imposed on economic blockade so far it was because of their concern for the people there and that if trade relations had almost come to a standstill it was because of the actions of the Portuguese administrationReference was, for instance, made to the circumstances under which the train services had to be suspended and the reaction of the dock workers when they knew that some of the ships they had to clear also touched Panjim port. It was stated that the people of Goa were aware of these and that the repeated satyagraha by them on In, dependence Day showed their true reactAion.","On August 15, reports surfaced about Goans, including prominent citizens, staging satyagraha inside Goa despite martial law. Around 70 Goans were arrested in batches of six, enduring severe beatings before release. The Portuguese authorities' claim that Goans weren't involved in the freedom struggle was contradicted by the reports. Demonstrations occurred in various locations, with villagers in Hedus facing police gunfire for supporting Indian satyagrahis. Villages like Ibrahimpur faced similar incidents. In Margao, 36 Goans staged satyagraha, attempting to hoist the Indian flag, resulting in arrests and beatings. Prime Minister Nehru and Home Minister Pant shared details based on reports from the Bombay Government, stating that 1,711 persons entered Goa on August 15. The total accounted for was 1,601, including fatalities and injuries. The Home Minister dispelled false claims of Indian troops on the border and addressed reports of bitterness in Goa due to the Indian blockade, emphasizing Goans' awareness and continued satyagraha on Independence Day as a true reflection of their sentiments.",Politics,162,809
Hindustan Times,1956-08-31 00:00:00,The States Reorganization Act is passed (1955),"One of a newly-independent India’s biggest challenges was to create a coherent administrative structure. After unifying most of the 571 princely states that existed at the time of independence, the government, in 1948 embarked on an effort to reorganize the country into states on the basis of administrative, geographical and historical considerations . But as India has discovered over its lifetime, language is a powerful part of Indian politics, and after a prolonged agitation, in 1953, the government was forced to separate Andhra Pradesh (from Madras state) for Telugu speakers. In the aftermath, as more such demands rose, the government appointed a commission, which suggested in 1955 that the country be divided into 16 states and three union territories on the basis of language. Eventually, the government moved to create 14 states and 6 Union Territories through the States Reorginisation Act, 1956","Enacted on August 31, 1956, the States Reorganization Act was a landmark legislation in India, fundamentally altering the country's administrative divisions. The Act aimed to reorganize state boundaries along linguistic lines, addressing historical and linguistic-cultural considerations.

The primary objective was to create states that reflected the linguistic and cultural identities of their populations, fostering better governance and administrative efficiency. As a result, several states were formed, and linguistic reorganization became a pivotal criterion in defining state boundaries.

The most significant outcome was the formation of linguistic states, including Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and others. The Act also established special provisions for the reorganization of the former princely states.

The States Reorganization Act of 1956 had far-reaching implications, shaping the political and cultural landscape of India. While it aimed at linguistic and administrative cohesion, it also prompted challenges and debates. Nonetheless, the restructuring laid the groundwork for more effective governance and representation based on linguistic and cultural affiliations, contributing to India's diverse federal structure.

Hindustan Times,1959-04-15 00:00:00,Dalai Lama’s visit to Delhi ruled out,"The Prime Minister will call on the Dalai Lama in Mussoorie on April 24, Mr S. Dutt, Foreign Secretary, announced here today.The Foreign Secretary told correspondents that the arrangements for the stay of the Dalai Lama and party in Mussoorie were being finalized in consultation with the Uttar Pradesh Government.
Two or three private bungalows were being reserved at this picturesque mountain resort to make the Tibetan “God-King” and his party comfortable.

In answer to questions, the Foreign Secretary said that there was no point in the Dalai Lama coming to Delhi as the Prime Minister* himself would be in Mussoorie at that time to fulfil a long-standing engagement to inaugurate the convention of the All-India Association of Travel Agents. This engagement, he pointed out, had been fixed a month ago. Besides, Delhi was very hot at this time.

Mr Dutt said the Government of India had taken full responsibility for the security of the Dalai Lama and they would fulfil that obligation.
He said that there would be no restrictions on anybody meeting the Dalai Lama except on security grounds. He emphasized that the Government had to take the minimum security precautions in this respect.

The Foreign Secretary said that a special train was being arranged to bring the Dalai Lama and party, consisting of about 100 people, from Tezpur to Banaras by the metre-gauge line via Siliguri, Katihar and Gorakhpur. From Banaras, another special train will carry them on the broad-gauge track to Dehra Dun from where they would drive up to Mussoorie. There will be an air-conditioned coach for the Dalai Lama.

He said that the Dalai Lama had been informed about the arrangements for his stay in Mussoorie, and that he had expressed no wishes to the contrary.
Mr Dutt said that Mr S. Sen, Joint Secretary, External Affairs Ministry, would reach Tezpur tomorrow to co-ordinate arrangements and provide facilities to a large number of correspondents and photographers, both Indian and foreign, who were waiting there for the Dalai Lama. He said that full facilities would be given for taking photographs.

Mr Dutt said that if the Dalai Lama wished to make a statement, the Government would see to it that it was made available to all. Possibly, it might be made available to correspondents almost simultaneously in Delhi too.

He said that special arrangements for the transmission of Press telegrams were being made at Tezpur.

The Foreign Secretary said that as nobody was being allowed to cross the inner line in NEFA, the Government were making arrangements for newsmen in Tezpur.
He pointed out that the Assam Government had issued an order restricting traffic near the frontier area, presumably because the road from Tezpur to the frontier was in a very bad condition.

The Foreign Secretary said that the Dalai Lama hoped to reach Tezpur on April 18. He added: “We do not know whether he would like to meet the Press, but whether he likes to do so or not, we shall certainly make arrangements for Press correspondents to have his darshan in a proper way. We want to avoid all scramble.”

Our Staff Correspondent writes from Shillong:

The Governor of Assam yesterday issued an order prohibiting the driving of motor vehicles around certain areas of Foothills from April 16 to April 18.
he reception to the Dalai Lama on behalf of the Indian Government will be full-fledged, says PTI. Jeeps sent to Bomdila to pick up the Dalai Lama and party are fitted with the State emblem. Four bronze crests with silver coating were ordered from a leading firm of jewellers in Madras.

The Dalai Lama’s party will include three members of Kashag and three high-ranking officials.
","Indian Prime Minister is scheduled to meet the Dalai Lama in Mussoorie on April 24, as announced by Foreign Secretary S. Dutt. The arrangements for the Dalai Lama's stay are being made in consultation with the Uttar Pradesh Government, with several private bungalows reserved for his party. The Prime Minister's engagement to inaugurate the convention of the All-India Association of Travel Agents in Mussoorie was cited as the reason for the meeting's location. The Government of India takes full responsibility for the Dalai Lama's security, with minimal restrictions on public access, and a special train is arranged for his travel from Tezpur to Mussoorie. The Dalai Lama is expected to reach Tezpur on April 18, and while it's uncertain whether he will meet the press, arrangements will be made for a proper interaction if desired. The Assam Government issues an order restricting traffic near the frontier area in anticipation of the Dalai Lama's journey.

The Afternoon Despatch & Courier,1963-12-05 00:00:00,Cyanobacteria’s invention of photosynthesis,"Cyanobacteria’s invention of photosynthesis is responsible for the oxygen in Earth’s atmosphere. “So they’re a big deal,” says Woodward Fischer, a geobiologist at Caltech who was not involved finding the thylakoid membranes. And “this is the kind of information that I thought we were not going to be able to pull out of fossils,” he says.

Most fossils preserve mineralized tissues such as bone or shells, but bacteria don’t contain such mineral structures. These fossils are “just compressions of carbon” squished into mud, Fischer says. To find the bacteria preserved is impressive enough, but the new fossils reveal complex structures inside the microscopic bacteria. “It suggests this kind of future where we might be able to pull more information, more cell biology and morphological detail out of these minuscule fossils,” he says.

Researchers already had indirect evidence from genetics and chemical studies that cyanobacteria had developed thylakoids by the time these fossilized bacteria lived, says Patricia Sanchez-Baracaldo, an evolutionary microbiologist at the University of Bristol in England (SN: 9/8/15). Still, exactly when the structures evolved is hotly debated (SN: 3/2/17). So it’s exciting to see fossil evidence of such old thylakoids, says Sanchez-Baracaldo, who was not involved in the work. “Any evidence that you have from that time period is important because the fossil record is really very sparse.”

Some researchers think that thylakoids may have evolved before the Great Oxidation Event around 2.4 billion years ago (SN: 12/11/19). Prior to that event, there were whiffs of oxygen here and there in the atmosphere, but it took the concentrated action of photosynthetic bacteria to send Earth’s oxygen levels skyrocketing. Stacks of thylakoids within cyanobacteria may have multiplied the bacteria’s oxygen production.

During the period when the now-fossilized cyanobacteria lived, oxygen levels in Earth’s atmosphere had plummeted again to a fraction of today’s levels, Sanchez-Baracaldo says. The fossils hint that there may have been small pockets where oxygen was abundant and could have fostered the evolution of the ancestors of plants and animals.

Many rocks that might harbor such fossils have been compressed and “cooked” destroying delicate intracellular structures like thylakoids, says Emmanuelle Javaux, an astrobiologist at the University of Liège in Belgium.

“We didn’t know that they could be preserved in such old microfossils,” she says. But she has no doubt that the dark lines stacked through tiny sausage-shaped cells represent thylakoids. “It cannot be something else, actually. This arrangement is very unique to cyanobacteria with thylakoids,” she says.

Side-by-side images of an oblong beige bacteria fossil next to a closeup of its inner structures that look like horizontal black lines. Those structures are membranes needed for photosynthesis, researchers say.
Researchers found microscopic fossils of cyanobacteria dubbed Navifusa majensis (left) in 1.73 billion- to 1.78 billion-year-old shale from Australia). A peek inside the fossils revealed black horizontal lines indicating the bacterium contained stacks of membranes known as thylakoids (right) like those in modern bacteria and plants where oxygen-producing photosynthesis takes place.

Javaux and colleagues found the oldest thylakoid-like structures in microfossils in shale from Australia. The structures were also present in about 1 billion-year-old fossils from Canada, but not in 1 billion-year-old ones from Congo. The rocks from Congo experienced slightly higher temperatures than the others, which may have destroyed fossil evidence of thylakoids. Or maybe those fossils are cyanobacteria that never evolved the structures or are another type of microbe entirely.

The researchers can’t tell from the fossils whether the Australian and Canadian cyanobacteria are direct ancestors of living species, Javaux says, but they are almost certainly cousins. The team hopes to investigate even older rocks from before the Great Oxidation Event for even more ancient evidence of thylakoids.","1.73 billion- to 1.78 billion-year-old shale from Australia).

The war was the second battle between India and Pakistan over the disputed region of Kashmir2.

The conflict began following Pakistan’s Operation Gibraltar, which was designed to infiltrate forces into Jammu and Kashmir to precipitate an insurgency against Indian rule1. Pakistani troops, dressed as Kashmiri locals, crossed the Line of Control (LOC) with the aim of starting an insurgency among the locals against the Indian government3. This infiltration strategy was codenamed Operation Gibraltar3.

However, Operation Gibraltar was a failure since the presence of Pakistanis was reported to the Indian authorities by the locals themselves3. The Indian Army retaliated and captured the Haji Pir Pass in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK)3. On September 1, Pakistan put into action its Operation Grand Slam aimed at capturing the town of Akhnoor in Jammu3. Although the Indian Army was taken by surprise by this move, Pakistan was not able to capture Akhnoor3.

India retaliated by attacking further south of the valley and successfully drove away the infiltrators from Kargil3. The international border (Radcliffe Line) was crossed by India on September 6, which marked the official beginning of the war3. The Indian Army captured certain areas in the Lahore district of Pakistan3. This war, unlike the previous conflict in 1947-48, was fought on many fronts including in Rajasthan3.

The war ended on September 23, 1965, after the United Nations Security Council called for an unconditional ceasefire from both India and Pakistan3. Both the USA and the USSR intervened diplomatically to prevent further escalation of the conflict3. The war was a victory for India even though Pakistan claims otherwise3. Their stated aim of ‘liberating Kashmir’ did not succeed3. Both countries held each other’s territory after the war3. India held 1840 sq. km of the area while Pakistan held 540 sq. km3. India had 3000 military casualties while Pakistan had 38003.

Background:

The Kashmir conflict is a territorial dispute between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir region, which has been the cause of two wars between the two countries. The region is primarily Muslim-majority, but it is also home to a significant Hindu minority.

The conflict began in 1947, when India and Pakistan gained independence from British rule. The princely state of Kashmir was given the option to join either India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir, Maharaja Hari Singh, was Hindu, but the majority of the population was Muslim. He initially declared Kashmir independent, but later decided to join India. This decision led to an armed rebellion by the Muslim population of Kashmir, who were supported by Pakistan.

The first Indo-Pakistani War broke out in 1947 and ended with a ceasefire in 1949. The ceasefire line that divides Kashmir into Indian-administered Kashmir and Pakistani-administered Kashmir is known as the Line of Control (LoC).

The 1965 War:

The Second Indo-Pakistani War began on September 1, 1965, when Pakistani forces attacked Chhamb, a strategically important town in Jammu and Kashmir, located near the border with Pakistan. The Pakistani attack was seen as an attempt to cut off the road between Jammu and Srinagar, the capital of Jammu and Kashmir.

The Indian army responded quickly to the Pakistani attack. Indian forces were able to repel the Pakistani attack and secure Chhamb. However, the war continued for several weeks, with both sides suffering heavy casualties.

The war ended with the signing of the Tashkent Agreement on January 10, 1966. The Tashkent Agreement was a ceasefire agreement that restored the status quo ante bellum, meaning that both sides agreed to withdraw to their pre-war positions.

Impact of the War:

The Second Indo-Pakistani War was a major turning point in the history of the two countries. It led to a significant increase in military spending and a deterioration in relations between India and Pakistan. The war also had a significant impact on the people of Kashmir, who continued to suffer from the conflict for many years to come.

Indian Express,1965-09-06 00:00:00,"""Indian Army Crosses International Border""","The article ""Indian Army Crosses International Border"" in The Times of India on September 6, 1965, reported on the Indian Army's crossing of the international border into Pakistan during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.

The article stated that the Indian Army had crossed the border in several places in the Punjab sector, including at Wagah, Khalra, and Khemkaran. The attack caught the Pakistani Army by surprise, and the Indian forces were able to make significant gains in the early hours of the operation.

The article also reported that the Indian Air Force was supporting the ground offensive with air strikes on Pakistani positions. The article stated that the Indian Air Force had destroyed a number of Pakistani tanks and aircraft.

The crossing of the international border by the Indian Army was a significant escalation of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. The war had begun in August with Pakistani infiltrators crossing into Kashmir. India responded by launching a counter-offensive, and the war quickly spread to the international border.

The war ended in September 1965 with the signing of the Tashkent Agreement. The agreement restored the status quo ante bellum, but it did not resolve the underlying issue of Kashmir.

The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 was a major turning point in the relationship between the two countries. The war led to a significant increase in military spending and to a hardening of attitudes on both sides. The war also had a significant impact on the region, as it led to the Soviet Union and the United States becoming more involved in the South Asia conflict.

Hindustan Times,1967-08-08 00:00:00,New frontiers in farming,"While India was on the cusp of a Green Revolution spurred by a high-yielding wheat variety MS Swaminathan had customized for India, the renowned agricultural scientist wrote a piece for HT in 1967 that describes his eureka moment. Based on a breed developed by American agronomist Norman Borlaug, the dwarf variety of wheat was painstakingly “crossed” to suit Indian conditions, he writes. At the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi, scientists working with him had made over 10,000 crosses, from which a superior “sharbati” type —still India’s best wheat variety — was developed by exposing the seeds to gamma radiation.

Implications for India, August 24, 1969

Shoring up India’s food security required two responses, one, scientific, and the other, economic, Swaminathan wrote in 1969, when India had started reaping the benefits of Green Revolution. When wheat varieties with the Japanese “Norin” gene were introduced from Mexico in 1963 and rice varieties with the Chinese “Dee.Gee.Woo-Gen” gene were introduced from the Philippines in 1964, the first yield barrier was broken. These varieties were amenable to an “economic response”, the second requirement, with accessible subsidized fertilisers and the strategy of minimum support prices, because “pricing is a very potent instrument” to get farmers to deliver the goods.

2010: A do-or-die year for agriculture, thanks to food inflation, February 20, 2010

A year after India suffered its worst drought in three decades in 2009, Swaminathan turned his attention to the pain of small farmers in this 2010 piece. “A large number of government schemes with a substantial financial outlay, such as the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana, Food Security Mission, and National Horticulture Mission exist, but are not making the desired impact on the productivity and production of small land holdings.” He suggested creating “60,000 pulses and oilseed villages” in rain-fed areas. In this article, he first envisioned the idea of dovetailing the MNREGA job-making scheme to the farm sector.

Keeping the Green Revolution green, July 27, 1996

In this article, Swaminathan recounted how India’s massive ramp-up of cereal output caught the world’s attention. India was no more a “begging bowl” for food. “Complacency should not overtake the farm sector, just because we now have over 30 million tonnes of food grains available with the government”

Not a grain to spare, September 7, 2007

Achieving food security became as national concern when India became depended on food aid by the US. The then PM Indira Gandhi met Swaminathan and scientist Vikram Sarabhai, asking them what it would take to store 10 million tonne of grain. “...I recall mentioning to her then that the first production breakthrough will occur in 1968 and that we can build the grain reserve desired by her by the early 1970s.”","The article provides insights into the pivotal role played by agricultural scientist MS Swaminathan in India's Green Revolution. It highlights Swaminathan's efforts in developing high-yielding wheat varieties suited for Indian conditions, which significantly boosted food production in the country. Additionally, it discusses Swaminathan's advocacy for policies and schemes aimed at enhancing agricultural productivity and supporting small farmers. The piece underscores the importance of continuous innovation and strategic interventions to ensure food security in India.

Indian Express,1968-11-27 00:00:00,Workmen Of Indian Express (P) Ltd. vs The Management,"The workmen, Gulab Singh and Satya Pal, were appointed by the respondent company in December, 1956 and February, 1955, respectively under the designation of copy-holders. It was alleged that they were entrusted with the duties of proof-readers and therefore they claimed that they should be treated as such. In July, 1959, the management issued an order in which the two workmen described as copy-holders. It was alleged that in spite of this order the management continued to give the workmen the work of proof-readers. A dispute whether the two workmen should be treated as proof-readers having arisen and having been espoused by the Delhi Union of Journalists, the Delhi Administration, by a notification dated August 2, 1961, referred it to the Industrial Tribunal, Delhi.

2. The management contended that the said dispute was an individual dispute and not an industrial dispute and that, that being so it was wrongly referred to the Tribunal and the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to adjudicate it. The Tribunal raised the preliminary issue, namely, whether the dispute relating to the said two workmen was an industrial dispute. The Tribunal held that it was not an industrial dispute but was only an individual dispute of the two workmen and therefore it had no jurisdiction to adjudicate the said reference. The workmen obtained special leave from this court and that is how this appeal has come up before us for disposal.

3. Apart from the oral evidence, the appellants relied on two documents, Ex. WW-1/A, which purported to be the minutes of a meeting held on November 15, 1960 of 17 working journalists and Ex. WB-1, purporting to be the minutes of a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Delhi Union of Journalists held on December 1, 1960. The union maintained that these two resolutions were proof of espousal of the dispute, the first by an appreciable number of the co-workers of the two aggrieved workmen and the second by the union and therefore the dispute though originally an individual dispute was converted into an industrial dispute. The Tribunal rejected Ex. WW-1/A, namely, the minutes of the alleged meeting of the 17 working journalists in the employ of the respondent company as unreliable. The Tribunal next considered whether, even assuming that the said 17 working journalists espoused the cause of the two workmen that espousal transformed the dispute in question into an industrial dispute, in other words, whether they constituted an appreciable number sufficient to change the dispute into an industrial dispute. At the material time the Branch Office of the respondent company at Delhi consisted in all of 388 employees, out of whom 140 were working in the press. The working journalists numbered 131, out of whom 63 were outstation correspondents and the remaining 68 were working journalists performing their duties in Delhi and New Delhi. The Tribunal held that though the said 63 working journalists were outstation journalists, they nevertheless belonged to the staff of the respondent company's Delhi Branch, and therefore, could not be excluded from consideration. The question which the tribunal posed to itself was whether 17 out of the said 131 working journalists could be said to be an appreciable number. According go the Tribunal, even if those 63 outstation correspondents were excluded and only 68 working journalists were considered, 17 of them would not constitute an appreciable number sufficient to convert said dispute into an industrial dispute. It also held that mere passing of a resolution without anything done to follow it up was not sufficient to constitute espousal. There was no evidence that after passing the said alleged resolution on November 15, 1960, anything further was done. On these facts the Tribunal did not consider the aforesaid resolution, assuming that it was passed, as constituting espousal.

4. As regards the resolution, dated December 1, 1960, the minutes of the meeting of the Executive Committee of the Delhi Union of Journalists were produced before the Tribunal. The minutes stated that the meeting after considering the representation made to it by the employees of the Indian Express decided to take up the case of the two workmen and authorised the office bearers of the union to initiate the necessary proceedings. The Tribunal found that the union initiated a fresh dispute before the Conciliation Officer and that there was no pending case initiated earlier, i.e. before December 1, 1960, by another union as alleged by the appellants which could have been continued by the union. A copy of the statement of claim filed by the union before the Conciliation Officer was also produced before the Tribunal. There was evidence that 31 working journalists employed in the respondent company had become the members of the Delhi Union of Journalists. But they had joined the union after the said order of July, 1959. The Tribunal's view was that the said 31 working journalists having joined the Delhi Union of Journalists after the cause of action had arisen in July, 1959, the said resolution of the union's Executive Committee would not constitute espousal, as there would be no nexus between the dispute and the union, and therefore, resolution dated December 1, 1960, did not have the effect of converting the said dispute into an industrial dispute.

5. Mr. Ramamurti, for the appellants, contended that the resolution, dated December 1, 1960, coupled with the fact that the union initiated conciliation proceedings in respect of the demand of the said two workmen was sufficient to transform the dispute into an industrial dispute. On the other hand, Mr. Gupte, appearing for the company, contended that a dispute which is prima facie an individual dispute may assume the character of an industrial dispute, if it is taken up or espoused by an appreciable body of the workmen of the establishment. Espousal by a union is regarded as sufficient, for that means that it is an espousal by an appreciable number of workmen in that establishment. If such a dispute is espoused by an outside union, the workmen of the establishment, appreciable in number, must be members of such a union. On these contentions the question for our determination is whether the Delhi Union of Journalists can be said to have espoused the dispute of the two workmen; if so, whether it did in time, and whether the union not being exclusively a union of the workmen employed in the respondent company, could espouse the said cause.

6. The resolution, dated December 1, 1960, passed by the Executive Committee of the union was not disbelieved by the Tribunal. That, coupled with the fact that the union authorities initiated the conciliation proceeding, must mean that union had espoused the cause of the two workmen. The dispute arose in July, 1959, when the management refused to treat the two workmen as proof-readers. Thereafter the Executive Committee, after considering a representation made to it by the employees of the respondent company, as the resolution reads, passed the said resolution authorising the officer-bearers of the union to initiate proceedings in the matter of the said dispute and the Secretary accordingly initiated proceedings before the Conciliation Officer. In these circumstances, it is not possible to appreciate how the espousal by the union can be said to be beyond time, as such espousal can only take place after and not before the dispute arose, or as counsel put it, the cause of action arose. In The Bombay Union of Journalists v. The Hindu, Bombay , this court in clear terms laid down that the test of an industrial dispute is whether at the date of the reference the dispute was taken up and supported by a union, or by an appreciable number of workmen. There being no doubt of the union having taken up the cause of the two workmen before the reference the first two parts of the question must be answered in the affirmative.

7. The next question is whether the cause of a workman in a particular establishment in an industry can be sponsored by a union which is not of workmen of that establishment but is one of which membership is open to workmen of other establishments is that industry. In Central Provinces Transport Services Ltd. v. Raghunath Gopal Patwardhan (1956 SCR 956), this court noted that decided cases in India disclosed three views as to the meaning of an industrial dispute : (1) a dispute between an employer and a single workman cannot be an industrial dispute, (2) it can be an industrial dispute, and (3) it cannot per se be an industrial dispute but may become one if taken up by a trade union or a number of workmen. After discussing the scope of industrial dispute as defined in Section 2(k) of the Act it observed that the preponderance of judicial opinion was clearly in favour of the last of the three views and that there was considerable reason behind it. In the Newspapers Ltd. v. The State Industrial Tribunal, U.P. (1957 SCR 754), the third respondent was employed as a lino typist by the appellant company. On an allegation of incompetence he was dismissed from service. His case was not taken up by any union of workers of the appellant company, nor by any of the unions of workmen employed in similar or allied trades. But the U.P. Working Journalists Union, Lucknow, with which the third respondent had no concern, took the matter to the Conciliation Board. On a reference being made to the Industrial Tribunal by the Government the legality of that reference was challenged by the appellant company on the ground that the said dispute could not be treated as an industrial dispute under the U.P. Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, which defined by Section 2 an industrial dispute as having the same meaning assigned to it in Section 2(k) of the Central Act. This court upheld the contention observing that the notification referring the said dispute proceeded on an assumption that a dispute existed between the employer and ""his workmen"", that Tajammul Hussain, the workman concerned, could not be described as ""workman"" nor could the U.P. Working Journalists Union be called ""his workman"" nor was there any evidence to show that a dispute had got transformed into an industrial dispute. The question whether the union sponsoring a dispute must be the union of workmen in the establishment in which the workman concerned is employed or not had not so far arisen. It seems such a question arose for the first time in the case of Bombay Union of Journalists v. The Hindu, Bombay (supra). The decision in that case laid down - (1) that the Industrial Disputes Act excluded its application to an individual dispute as distinguished from a dispute involving a group of workmen unless such a dispute is made a common cause by a body or a considerable section of workmen and (2) the members of a union who are not workmen of the employer against whom the dispute is sought to be raised cannot by their support convert an individual dispute into an industrial dispute. Persons who seek to support the cause must themselves be directly and substantially interested in the dispute and persons who are not the employees of the same employer cannot be regarded as so interested. The court held that the dispute there being prima facie an individual dispute it was necessary in order to convert it into an industrial dispute that it should be taken up by a union of the employees or by an appreciable number of employees of Hindu, Bombay. The Bombay Union of Journalists not being a union of the employees of the Hindu, Bombay, but a union of all employees in the industry of journalism in Bombay, its support of the cause of the workman concerned would not convert the individual dispute into an industrial dispute. The members of such a union cannot be said to be persons substantially and directly interested in the dispute between the workman concerned and his employer, the Hindu Bombay. But in Workmen v. M/s. Dharampal Premchand , this court, after reviewing the previous decisions, distinguished the case of Hindu, Bombay and held that notwithstanding the width of the words used in Section 2(k) of the Act a dispute raised by an individual workman cannot become an industrial dispute, unless it is supported either by his union or in the absence of a union by a number of workmen, that a union may validly raise a dispute though it may be a minority union of the workmen employed in an establishment, that if there was no union of workmen in an establishment a group of employees can raise the dispute which becomes an industrial dispute even though it is a dispute relating to an individual workman and lastly that where the workmen of an establishment have no union of their own and some or all of then have joined a union of another establishment belonging to the same industry, if such a union takes up the cause of the workman working in an establishment which has no union of its own, the dispute would become an industrial dispute if such a union can claim a representative character in a way that its support would make the dispute an industrial dispute.

8. The evidence of the union secretary as that in 1959-60, 31 working journalists of the respondent company were members of the Delhi Union of Journalists. It was nobody's case that these 31 members did not continue to be the members of that union in 1960-61 also. If the number of working journalists in the respondent company were to be taken as 68, membership of the union by as many as 31 working journalists would certainly confer on the union a representative character. Even if the number of working journalists were to be taken as 131, it would not be unreasonable to say that 31, i.e., about 25 per cent. of them would, by becoming the members of the union, give a representative character to the union. It is clear from the evidence that at the material time there was no union of working journalists employed by the respondent company. Therefore, in accordance with the decision in the Workmen v. M/s. Dharampal Premchand (supra), the union can be said to have a representative character qua the working journalists employed in the respondent company. There can be no doubt that the union had taken up the cause of the two workmen by its executive committee passing the said resolution and its office-bearers having followed up that resolution by taking the matter before the Conciliation Officer. Though the grievance of the two workmen arose in July, 1959, when the management declined to accept them as proof-readers the union had sponsored their cause before the date of reference as laid down in the case of Hindu, Bombay. That being the position it cannot be gainsaid that the dispute was transformed into an industrial dispute as it was sponsored by a union which possessed a representative character vis-a-vis the working journalists in the employ of the respondent company.

9. We must, therefore, hold that the tribunal's view that the dispute was not an industrial dispute was incorrect. The award, therefore, will have to be aside and the appeal of the workmen allowed. There will be no order as to costs.","The case involves a dispute over the designation and duties of two employees, Gulab Singh and Satya Pal, who were initially hired as copy-holders but claimed they should be treated as proof-readers. The management disagreed, leading to a referral of the dispute to the Industrial Tribunal. The Tribunal initially ruled that it was not an industrial dispute but an individual one, as the support from co-workers and the union was deemed insufficient. However, upon appeal, it was argued that the Delhi Union of Journalists had indeed espoused the cause of the employees, transforming it into an industrial dispute. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the employees, stating that the union's support, coupled with the initiation of conciliation proceedings, demonstrated the transformation of the dispute. It concluded that the Tribunal's decision was incorrect, and the dispute should indeed be considered an industrial one. Therefore, the award was set aside, and the appeal of the workmen was allowed.",Politics,157,2555
Hindustan Times,1969-07-16 00:00:00,Forgotten footsteps,"As these articles are concluded, one can spot some such memorials-Rajghat, Birla House, Bhangi Colony. We have not mentioned them because they are better known than Ansari Kothl or Principal Rudra’s house in Kashmere Gate.But if one has to name just one place in Delhi which was hallowed by the memory of Gandhi’s stay and still stands a permanent signpost for his work. It is the Harijan Niwas near the I.D. hospital at Kingsway Camp. Gandhi lived there regularly between 1935 and 1938.

There he set up the headquarters of the Harijan Sevak Sangh, the organization which launched a constructive programme to end untouchability and make the Harijan self-reliant and useful members of society by giving them basic and technical education.As Gandhi started living in the 20-acre colony hemmed in by trees and gardens, the place soon became the rendezvous of all national leaders who came to him for advice and guidance.

A Congress convention presided over by Subhas Bose was held there; the Congress Working Committee took the historic decision to oppose the provincial autonomy proposed by the British Government.

In a two-room apartment Gandhi and his wife lived for many months. They later shifted to Kasturba Kutir. He built the Udyogshala brick by brick to wean away Harijans from scavenging and other menial work. The dome-tiered circular red-sandstone Prarthana Mandir standing on columns was design ed by Gandhi. In the Bapu Ashram Harijan children are taught the three R’s.Next to Gandhi’s room, there was a modest two-storey bungalow which was built for Nehru and Subhas Bose as they used to live in the colony frequently. Now it is a guest house.

Nearly a year after his 21-day fast against Macdonald’s Communal Award in Yeravda Jail, Gandhi came to Delhi and founded the Untouchability League on Oct. 21, 1932. The League was, at first, functioning within the premises of a textile mill in Subzi Mandi. It then had only two office rooms. It was later renamed-Harijan Sevak Sangh by Gandhi. Mr G. D. Birla was is first President. Mr A. V. Thakkar was General Secretary.

It was under Gandhi’s influence that a Delhi landlord sold 20 acres of land (then part of Dhaka village, later known as Timarpur) for ₹30,000. Mr Birla donated the amount.The Harijan Sevak Sangh started work from 1933. Gandhi himself drafted its constitution. At first an office and a hall were built; later a few two-room tenements were built for Gandhi and his party.

Next year Gandhi toured the country pleading for a better deal to the outcastes. Public places, wells and temples were thrown open at many places to Harijans, and funds were collected for their welfare. He came to Delhi and during the five days that he stayed here, he collected ₹12,000.

From public donations, the Sangh started an udyogshala (industrial training institute), a school for Harijan girls, and a primary school (Bapu Ashram) for social. economic and educational advancement of Harijans.

The number of trainees at the Udyogshala-situated in the colony-has increased from 20 to 200 over the years. The objective of the institute is to impart technical training to the Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes tuitions and teach them “non-caste skilled jobs.”Inaugurating the institute, Gandhi declared in 1986: “I desire that Harijan Niwas should turn out such trainees from its portals who should be able to eradicate untouchability root and branch.”

The trainees receive instruction in jobs like fitting, turning, electric wiremanship, press composing, molding, carpentry, shoe-making, Hindi typing and stenography, tailoring etc. The Udyogshala is affiliated to the National Council for Vocational Training.

Sixty-year-old Mangal Singh is one who had proved the usefulness of such a training. From a humble beginning, he is now an accomplished technician and teacher.

Thirty-five years ago he came to Delhi as an illiterate farmer. The Sangh admitted him to the udyogshala. He is now a teacher there, earning enough to maintain his family and educate his children. He lives in a cottage in the colony. But for the training Mangal Singh could have been yet another poor and underemployed landless tenant .

Mangal Singh said at one time a wanted to go back to his village but Gandhi persuaded him to stay on, explaining that trained men would be more useful in village than unskilled ones. Later Mangal Singh became a valet to Gandhi. “Gandhi believed in nature cure. I used to message him daily with clay,” he said.

Viyogi Hari, who was closely associated with Gandhi during his stay at the colony had a few interesting anecdotes to narrate. These reflected Gandhiji’s scrupulous attachment to and faith in principles.

Gandhiji, Viyogi Hari said, would frequently go round the campus inquiring about the working of several departments. One day at the tailoring department he was terribly upset to see mill clothe being used for making uniforms.“Why mill cloth here? If my own people have no faith in khadi then what’s the use of my staying here?” he burst out in anger and sorrow.

It was useless arguing with him that the department was executing contract jobs, and those who have placed the orders wanted only mill cloth used.

Gandhi’s cool answer was: “We should not undertake the work of people who have no faith inkhadi.” From the next day the department accented nothing but khadi from its clientele.

In the community kitchen Gandhi one day saw two students cooking chapatis. One of them left the work stood up with folded hands before Gandhi. But the other did rot pay him any attention and went on cooking.","
Harijan Niwas near the I.D. hospital at Kingsway Camp in Delhi holds significant historical importance as Mahatma Gandhi lived there between 1935 and 1938. It served as the headquarters of the Harijan Sevak Sangh, an organization initiated by Gandhi to eradicate untouchability and provide basic and technical education to Harijans. The 20-acre colony became a meeting point for national leaders seeking Gandhi's advice. The Sangh, initially called the Untouchability League, was renamed Harijan Sevak Sangh by Gandhi. It started its work in 1933 and focused on social, economic, and educational advancement for Harijans. The Udyogshala, part of the colony, aimed to impart technical training to Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes, teaching non-caste skilled jobs. The institute, affiliated with the National Council for Vocational Training, has positively impacted individuals like Mangal Singh, who transformed from an illiterate farmer to a skilled technician and teacher through the Sangh's training.",Obituaries,147,922
Hindustan Times,1969-07-20 00:00:00,Apollo crosses midway point on way back home,"Yearning for the good earth Apollo-11 moon explorers slept long and deep today, heading for a splashdown in the Pacific tomorrow.
Yearning for the good earth Apollo-11 moon explorers slept long and deep today, heading for a splashdown in the Pacific tomorrow.

The spacemen were to have awakened at 9 p.m. (IST) but they were slumbering so well that mission control decided to let them sleep as long as they wanted for the critical re-entry through the atmosphere.
They still were asleep at noon, their spaceship speeding along at 3,645 miles an hour, 132,790 miles from the earth.

Mission control said all systems were normal and the spacecraft’s path was so accurate that a minor mid-course correction that had been scheduled for 1102 p.m. (IST) had been cancelled.

Apollo-11 crossed the midway point in time between the moon and its return to earth at 6-47 a.m. (4-17 p.m. IST). At that time, it was about 148,000 miles (238.183 km) from the earth.

Their spacecraft will accelerate as the grip of earth’s gravity gets tighter until they are racing along at 24,000 miles an hour (38,624 kph) when they hit the earth’s atmosphere about 75 miles (120 km) high over Australia.

Earlier. Armstrong summed up the crew’s feelings as they faced just one more full day in space: “No matter where you travel. it’s always nice to get home.”

He explained that the moon samples were closed in vacuum packed containers and were sealed to prevent possible contamination of the earth.

The final television show from Apollo-11 is scheduled on the eve of the astronauts’ home-coming.
As they head for their fiery dash back through the atmosphere. the astronauts may see an unusual number of lights alone the west coast of the United States.

Homes and business houses in several cities have been asked to turn their lights on early tomorrow.

American television watchers last night saw colour pictures of the moon, astronauts Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin, and their scientific equipment in a programme beamed directly from the home-bound spacecraft. They showed their two containers of geological specimens and their apparatus for collecting “solar wind” particles.

In the evening, radio communications between the space control centre here and the Apollo had been cut for 40 minutes, due to a faulty aerial.

When contact was re-established, the Centre announced it had picked up inexplicable and bizarre noises which appeared not to have come from Apollo-11. The noises, which were like those made by a triumphant sports crowd, were similar to those picked up during an earlier Apollo flight and never explained.Soon after the mid course correction, mission control discovered that Apollo-11 was rotating too rapidly when placed in what is known as the automatic “barbecue mode.”

This entails rotating the spacecraft at the rate of about three revolutions per hour to ensure that no one side of the Apollo-11 is exposed too long to either the heat of the sun or the cold of space.

It was decided to turn off the automatic system and start again or to “recycle” the computer, in space jargon.

When contact was re-established after the short cut, the astronauts calmly responded to another request for a radio check. With “Houston-Apollo-11 how do you read me?”

With relief evident in his voice, Controller McCandless responded: “You’re loud and clear Apollo-11.”

“So, what’s new?” asked Collins. “We were wondering what was new with you up there,” was the reply.

“It’s all very quiet. we’re just sitting letting the thruster (rocket) firings damp down. When it gets good enough just let us know and we’ll start the PTC (passive thermal control-the barbecue roll”).

A little later, the astronauts added: “It’s nice to sit here and watch the earth getting larger and larger and the moon smaller and smaller.”

The astronauts will go into 18 days quarantine in the laboratory on their return as a precaution against any possibly harmful micro-organisms which they might have picked up from the moon.

The total quarantine period is 21 days, but this includes the three days of their flight home. taken from the moment when Eagle rejoined the mother ship Columbia.The astronauts had only a few light duties left to perform.

The weakest link in the elaborate quarantine comes on Thursday when the spaceship hatch is opened for less than 30 seconds.

It is during that half-minute that lunar organisms, should they exist, would most likely leap from the lungs of the returning spacemen into earth’s atmosphere. “We believe that the danger. If there be any danger, will be from the material that is contained within the astronauts. This is where it will be viable. ‘ said Air Force Col. John Pickering, Director of Lunar Receiving Operations in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) office manned space flight.

The experts feel the precautions are adequate and that while the hatch opening may be the weakest link it did not constitute what they would call “a breach in the quarantine.”The astronauts had only a few light duties left to perform.

Waiting aboard the Hornet will be President Richard Nixon. Mr Nixon will again have to settle for an electronic congratulation of the astronauts.

Neil Armstrong described his first short step on the moon’s surface as a giant leap for mankind and President Nixon has pointed out that the heavens have now become a part of man’s world. It will take some time for millions of earth-dwellers to realise the full significance of the fact that human beings like themselves have actually set foot on the moon, that familiar heavenly body which has been celebrated in poetry and legend for thousands of years as a symbol of inaccessible beauty. In fact, the physical environment of the moon is a cruel and hostile one for living beings, since there is no air or water there and no gradations of light and shade. Some have questioned the value of sending men to risk their lives to land on so hostile a shore. But the scientists assure us that the exploration of the moon will unfold many of the secrets of the universe and that a moon landing may also prove to be the first milestone on the road to the remote world of the stars.

Hindustan Times,1969-09-22 00:00:00,Govt fixes car prices,"The Government of India today issued a Gazette notification imposing statutory control on the prices of the Ambassador, Fiat and Standard Harold cars.The Government of India today issued a Gazette notification imposing statutory control on the prices of the Ambassador, Fiat and Standard Harold cars.The action was taken under the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act of 1951 which empowers the Government to control supply, distribution and prices of certain articles.The notification, which comes into effect immediately, fixed the ex-factory price of the Ambassador car at ₹15,316, the Fiat 14,325 and the Standard Herald (4-door) 14,003.

The revised prices provide for an increase of ₹424 for the Ambassador and ₹774 for the Fiat. There has been no price revision in the case of the Standard Herald as the Government is awaiting the recommendations of the Tariff Commission regarding to the four door model. The price of the Standard Herald has been pegged at the existing level.

According to the new rates, the prices of the three cars on the road in Delhi will be about ₹21,000 for the Ambassador, ₹19,700 for the Fiat and ₹19.800 for the Standard Herald.There has been no statutory price control on cars hitherto. The industry and the Government have, however, followed the practice of informal price control under which car prices were fixed by mutual consultation.

Order amended

A Press note issued by the Ministry of Industrial Development, Internal Trade and Company Affairs said the Government had taken the action in view of the unilateral price rise of ₹2,313 for the Fiat and ₹1,267 for the Standard Herald by the manufacturers earlier this month The Ambassador manufacturers retained their prevailing selling price.

The notification today amends the Motor Car Distribution and Sales Order of 1950, issued under Section 18G of the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act. Two new clauses have been added to the Order prohibiting manufacturers from withholding the supplies and the dealers from sales to the consumers at the notified prices.The prices announced today have been fixed on the basis of the Tariff Commission’s investigation into the cost structure of the car industry. The Commission had been asked in Dec. 1967 to fix a fair selling price for cars take into consideration the increased labour and other manufacturing costs. Its report was submitted in May this year.

In April, the three manufacturers represented to the Government that they should be allowed to increase the prices of their cars immediately on the ground that they were incurring considerable losses by selling their cars at the approved prices. The increases sought were ₹1,750 the Ambassador, ₹1,600 for Fiat and ₹1,200 for the Standard. In the case of the Ambassador and the Fiat, the price increases were sought as a first step.The manufacturers reiterated their demand in July again and sought higher increases ( ₹2,541 for Ambassador. ₹2,797 tor Fiat and ₹2,785.71 for Standard Herald). It was represented that the Government should take into account the recent increases in the prices of bought out components. the increase in the price of steel, the statutory minimum bonus payable under section 10 of the Bonus Act and additional cost of warranty claims and resultant increase in dealers margin.

Referring to the manufacturers demand Ministry sources maintained that in the Government’s view the price rise demanded by the manufacturers was based on ‘an arithmetical calculation’ without taking into consideration operational efficiency of their plants and the scope for cost reduction These sources held that in fixing prices, the Government had taken note of its responsibility to ensure efficiency in the industry as well as to make sure that it was just to both the manufacturers and the consumers.No increase has been afforded to the dealers in the revised prices as it was felt that the dealers did not have to put in any special effort for sales promotion in the present market conditions. Another factor that weighed with the Government was the unsatisfactory nature of after-sales services by the dealers according to the Ministry sources.

The original prices of cars had been fixed after a Tariff Commission inquiry in 1956. Since then, the increases have totalled ₹3,702 for the Ambassador, ₹3,811 for Fiat and ₹4,555 tor Standard.

In regard to Standard Herald ear, the official spokesman explained that the Tariff Commission had earlier recommended price for two-door model. The price recommended was ‘’little less than the current price,” adds PTI.The Government however, asked the Tariff Commission to re. commend price for the four-door model and its report was “expected any time.” The spokesman said that suitable revision of the four door model will be examined after the receipt of the report.

On the question of any revision of prices in future, the spokesman said the prices fixed today would be reviewed “as and when necessary after taking into account all relevant considerations and in consultation with the Tariff Commission whenever considered appropriate.”","

Q: Swamiji, would you have any tips for the youth to achieve real success?

Real success means organising one's life and one’s goals by giving the right amount of time for each of those. You can’t ignore the material, and you can’t ignore the intellectual development and educational development and you certainly cannot ignore the development of spiritual consciousness. 

  “Real success comes from adopting a way of life that gives time to each one of those. That is exactly what you find in the Yogoda Satsanga Lessons. The whole road map for balanced living: for the health of the body, the efficiency of the mind, in education and cultivation of the intellect and the rational qualities is all very important.

  “And learning to meditate and take a little time. 10 minutes may be in the morning and 10 minutes in the evening. (That's not really fair in a way because once they do it for 10 minutes, they will want to do it for 20 minutes, and once they do 20 minutes, they would want to do it longer…that's how meditation works!) 

  “But the point is…to be successful you have to build a plan for life…nobody is going to be successful by waiting for it to happen. You have to structure the 24 hours we each have in a day. You have to look at that and consciously take control of your time and consciously use your time for the aspirations that you have.” Further info.: yssofindia.org","Swami Chidananda Giri, president and spiritual head of Yogoda Satsanga Society of India/Self-Realization Fellowship, offers tips for youth to achieve real success. He emphasizes the importance of balancing physical, intellectual, and spiritual development. Real success, according to Swamiji, comes from adopting a way of life that allocates time to each aspect. He suggests incorporating meditation into daily routines for at least 10 minutes in the morning and evening. Building a conscious plan for life and taking control of one's time are crucial for success.

Real success means organising one's life and one’s goals by giving the right amount of time for each of those. You can’t ignore the material, and you can’t ignore the intellectual development and educational development and you certainly cannot ignore the development of spiritual consciousness. 

  “Real success comes from adopting a way of life that gives time to each one of those. That is exactly what you find in the Yogoda Satsanga Lessons. The whole road map for balanced living: for the health of the body, the efficiency of the mind, in education and cultivation of the intellect and the rational qualities is all very important.

  “And learning to meditate and take a little time. 10 minutes may be in the morning and 10 minutes in the evening. (That's not really fair in a way because once they do it for 10 minutes, they will want to do it for 20 minutes, and once they do 20 minutes, they would want to do it longer…that's how meditation works!) 

  “But the point is…to be successful you have to build a plan for life…nobody is going to be successful by waiting for it to happen. You have to structure the 24 hours we each have in a day. You have to look at that and consciously take control of your time and consciously use your time for the aspirations that you have.” Further info.: yssofindia.org","Swami Chidananda Giri, president and spiritual head of Yogoda Satsanga Society of India/Self-Realization Fellowship (YSS/SRF), emphasizes the importance of balanced living for achieving real success.

The Hindu,1970-08-25 00:00:00,India can take it(From an editorial),"Foreign reporters tend to flock to trouble spots all over the world which are in the news. The Government of India seems to have taken strong objection to the British Broadcasting Corporation’s coverage of Calcutta which has been the storm-centre of political strife for some time now. The External Affairs Ministry has gone so far as to ask the B.B.C. correspondent in India to leave the country, because his headquarters Organisation has been showing a series of documentaries of life in Calcutta by the French photographer, Louis Malle. Evidently, what has displeased the officials in New Delhi is that the B.B.C. took no notice of their protests and continued to show a series of Malle films on television which seemed indirectly to justify the rise of naxalite outrages in Calcutta. It is, of course, painful for any nation to have its defects described at great length in foreign papers or foreign films. But it is only in totalitarian countries that unfavourable reports are banned and correspondents expelled at short notice. We should be able to tolerate distortions and indictments since we ourselves engage in criticisms of other countries.","The Indian Government has demanded the departure of the British Broadcasting Corporation's correspondent from India due to the BBC's coverage of Calcutta, a focal point of political unrest. This action was prompted by the BBC's airing of documentaries by French photographer Louis Malle, depicting life in Calcutta, which officials felt indirectly justified naxalite violence. While it's discomforting for a nation to have its flaws spotlighted in foreign media, the response of banning unfavorable reports and expelling correspondents is characteristic of totalitarian regimes.

The Soviet statement described the U.S. measures, announced by President Nixon on Monday night, as “a new escalation of its aggressive actions” in Vietnam and said they had complicated further the situation in South-East Asia and “are fraught with serious consequences for international peace and security.”

It said “the Soviet Government resolutely insists that the U.S. steps taken to block the coast and disrupt ground communications of the democratic Republic of Vietnam be cancelled without delay, that acts of the US. aggression against the DRV be ended and that the right to freedom of international navigation and trade be respected.”Expressing the hope that this “point of view” is shared by the Governments and peoples of aU peace-loving States, the statement reaffirmed the Soviet Union’s support to the struggle of the heroic Vietnamese people.

“The Soviet people have been giving and will continue to give the Vietnamese people the necessary support,” it said.

Warning the United States that it was following “a dangerous and slippery road,” the statement asked, “what would happen if, in response to the unilateral actions of the United States threatening the legitimate interests of a number of States and security of their citizens, these States Act the way States does now to Vietnam.

The statement declared that the only “real way” to settle the Vietnam problem was to respect the Vietnamese people’s right to decide their destiny themselves without any interference and pressure from outside.“If the United States is really ready to do so, it should return to the negotiating table in Paris,” it said.

The statement suspected that the real purpose of these actions was not to “save the United States from humiliation,” but to save the notorious “Vietnamization” policy which suffered an obvious failure.

It added: “The intensification of the bombings of the DRV territory and Washington’s attempts to establish single-handedly i own rules of international navigation cannot but cause indignation and strong censure. These actions show again to the whole world the piratic nature of the war which the United States has unleashed and continues to wage against the Vietnamese people for many years.

“The mining of the approaches to the ports of the DRV and the attempts to prevent foreign ships from entering its territorial and inland waters create a direct threat to ships and the lives of seamen of many States which carry cargoes for the DRV population. Nobody gave the United States the right to restrict anybody’s freedom of navigation in high seas. The U. S.’ measures are a gross violation of the generally recognized principle of freedom of navigation.”Declaring that the Soviet Union considered as inadmissible these actions which jeopardized the freedom of navigation and the security of Soviet and other ships, the statement warned that I the US Government would bear the entire responsibility for the possible consequences of its illegal actions.

This new escalation of the war, the statement warned, would not break the will of the Vietnamese people fighting for freedom and independence. “The actions now taken by the United States can only serve to drag out the conflict, to continue the bloodshed, and will inevitably entail new loss of life and destruction.”

Broadcast by Moscow and transmitted by the official Tass news agency, the statement reiterated Kremlin pledges of ‘ “necessary support” for Hanoi.","The Soviet Union demanded the immediate cancellation of the U.S. blockade of North Vietnamese ports, cessation of ""acts of aggression"" against Vietnam, and respect for the right to freedom of international navigation and trade.

India will celebrate the first anniversary of freedom from smallpox on July 5.
According to the Union Health and Family Planning Minister, Dr Karan Singh, it is a “feat no less significant than the launching of a satellite.”
World Health Organisation Director-General, Dr Halfdan Mahler has hailed India’s achievement as “accomplishing the impossible.” It was one of the greatest victories of the entire global smallpox campaign, he pointed out.

During the most intensive campaign in 1973-75, jeeps, motor launches and even elephants were used to reach inaccessible areas to combat the disease and prevent its reappearance.
The scale of the achievement can well be gathered from the fact that as late as 1974, 1,88,003 cases and 31,262 deaths were reported.

The last indigenous case was reported on May 17, 1975, from the Katihar district of Bihar. Thereafter, one case, imported from the Sylhet district of Bangladesh, was detected in Cachar, Assam, on May 24, 1975.
The credit for- the disappear of the disease, according to the health experts, goes to an interplay of a number of factors ranging from the epidemiological edge that smallpox has over other communicable diseases from the point of view of the control, the availability of good vaccine and the extremely competent management and execution of a well-defined eradication strategy.

Active co-operation between various agencies, like the WHO, the Central and the State Governments, the public and the private sectors, mass media, voluntary organisations and the people at large, was another crucial factor in making the campaign a success. Workers belonging to other departments were also mobilised for the purpose, particularly in Bihar.","The success in eradicating smallpox can be attributed to several key factors as acknowledged by health experts. These include:

1. **Epidemiological Edge**: Smallpox had certain characteristics that made it more controllable compared to other communicable diseases. This provided an advantage in devising effective control measures.

2. **Good Vaccine Availability**: The availability of a reliable and effective vaccine played a crucial role. The smallpox vaccine was instrumental in preventing new cases and contributing to the disease's eradication.

3. **Competent Management and Execution**: A well-defined eradication strategy was developed and competently executed. This involved meticulous planning, coordination, and implementation of vaccination campaigns and surveillance measures.

4. **Active Cooperation**: Collaboration among various stakeholders was vital. This included cooperation between the World Health Organization (WHO), central and state governments, public and private sectors, mass media, voluntary organizations, and the general public. 

5. **Mobilization of Resources**: Resources were mobilized effectively, including manpower from various departments, especially in regions like Bihar, to ensure widespread vaccination coverage and surveillance.

Overall, the combination of these factors contributed significantly to the successful eradication of smallpox.",Science and Technology,176,305

Workers belonging to other departments were also mobilised for the purpose, particularly in Bihar.

The Central Government spent about four crore rupees during 1974-75 as assistance to the States for the appointment of additional staff and supply of vaccine. Another rupees four crore were spent by the State Governments on their own during the same year.

While there was a certain rigidity in the expenditure of Government funds, the WHO assistance was utilised in a more flexible manner, with the epidemiologists being given full authority over the funds to be spent within a given ceiling and guidelines. To ensure mobility of the personnel involved in the work, the WHO supplied 259 jeeps and 239 motor-cycles during 1973-75, To reach inaccessible regions, motor launches, boats and even elephants were hired.

Epidemiologically, the control of smallpox admittedly is relatively easy as compared to other communicable diseases. There is no human carrier stage as is the case of diphtheria and typhoid, nor any animal carriers as in rabies; and no insect vector as in malaria.

The achievement of zero status is the first stage in the eradication of smallpox. If no indigenous case is detected for a period of two years, after the last case the country will, by 1977, claim to have eradicated smallpox.","
India marked the first anniversary of freedom from smallpox on July 5, a significant achievement hailed by the World Health Organization Director-General, Dr. Halfdan Mahler, as ""accomplishing the impossible."" The eradication effort involved intensive campaigns from 1973-75, employing diverse means such as jeeps, motor launches, and elephants to reach inaccessible areas. In 1974, 1,88,003 cases and 31,262 deaths were reported, highlighting the scale of the challenge. The last indigenous case was in May 1975, and the disease disappeared due to factors like effective vaccination, competent management, and a well-defined eradication strategy. Active cooperation among various agencies, including WHO, governments, media, voluntary organizations, and the public, played a crucial role. The WHO's flexible assistance included funding, vehicles, and supplies. With no reported cases for two years, India aimed to claim eradication status by 1977.

Mr. Justice Beg will take over as Chief Justice tomorrow. The President is understood to have accepted Justice Khanna’s resignation.

Mr. Justice Ray, who has been a judge of the Supreme Court since 1969 had also superseded three of his colleagues-Mr. Justice J.M. Shelat, Mr. Justice K S. Hegde, and Mr. Justice A. N. Grover - when he was appointed Chief Justice on April 25, 1973. The three superseded judges had also resigned.

Mr. Justice- Khanna was to have retired in July 1977 on completion of 65 years of age whereas Mr. Justice Beg will retire in February 1978.The principle of seniority in the matter of appointing the Chief Justice of India was thus given a go by in 1973. In the appointment of Mr. Justice Beg to this high office, the President has not set a precedent or broken any convention, it is pointed out.

In terms of Article 124 of the Constitution, Mr. Justice Khanna “by writing under his hand addressed to the President” resigned his office. The same article provides that every judge of the Supreme Court shall be appointed by tte President “by warrant under his hand and seal after consultation with such of the judges of the Supreme Court and of the High Courts in the States as the President may deem necessary for the purpose and shall hold office until he attains the age of sixty-five years”


Recently, the Supreme Court Bar Association had suggested that seniority should be respected in appointing the Chief Justice. It felt that in order to maintain the independence of the judiciary, the appointment of the Chief Justice of India should not depend on executive approval and the best way of excluding executive interference was to appoint him on the basis of seniority.","President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed appointed Mr. Justice Mirza Hameedullah Beg of the Supreme Court as the Chief Justice of India, succeeding Mr. Justice A. N. Ray. The appointment led to the resignation of Mr. Justice H. R. Khanna, another Supreme Court Judge who was superseded. Mr. Justice Khanna resigned in protest against his supersession. This move deviated from the principle of seniority, as Mr. Justice Beg was appointed despite Mr. Justice Khanna being the senior judge. Mr. Justice Beg was set to take over as Chief Justice, while Mr. Justice Khanna, who was supposed to retire in July 1977, had his resignation accepted by the President. The appointment sparked discussions about maintaining the independence of the judiciary and the role of executive approval in such appointments.",Politics,126,358

CPM Blames Janata

The CPI(M) blamed “the political leadership of the ruling Janata Party and its government” for mismanaging Indira Gandhi’s arrest and prosecution. In a statement, the politburo of the party said the arrest and prosecution of the former PM and her closest colleagues was primarily a political act. It should not have been dealt with in the routine legal procedural way. Whatever legal procedures had to be adopted should have been supplemented by political action by way of mobilising public opinion against the anti-democratic postures and action of the former prime minister. The statement said while the bureaucrats of the CBI and the Home Ministry could not be absolved of their share of responsibility for mismanaging their action in arresting Mrs Gandhi and producing her before the court, “the major responsibility falls on the political leadership of the ruling Janata Party and its government”. It said the biggest crime with which Mrs Gandhi and her closest colleagues should be charged was “the crime against democracy”.

The West Indians confirm their domination again as they lifted the second successive World Cup with the most authoritative fashion. Nobody came close to match Caribbean prowess as an exceptional talented team. Again eight countries took part, and from a cricketer's point of view it was a shame that once more South Africa were not considered again. The two associate members, Sri Lanka and Canada joined the remaining six playing nations. As in the last tournament, the teams participating were divided in two groups of four.

He converted the good balls into juicy ones and cruised along to put the West Indies in a great position. The exuberance of Richards swung the match away from the Englishmen. Richards finally ended unbeaten on 138 out of 286, after putting on 139 with Collis King (86), finished the innings with a towering six into the Mound Stand.

England responded in an emphatic fashion with openers Mike Brearley and Geoff Boycott putting on 129 for the first wicket. But Michael Holding removed both the openers in quick succession and with asking run-rate climbing up, West Indies were the firm favorites for the title. Joel Garner tore out the England middle order on his way to figures of five for 38 off 11 overs.

Hindustan Times,1980-01-10 00:00:00,Cong-I gets two-thirds majority,"New Delhi- After a three-day massacre of electoral opponents and winning seats at a galloping rate the Congress-I today achieved a two-thirds majority in the Lok Sabha the effective strength of which now.is 525. With the capturing of the Saharsa seat in Bihar, the Congress has bagged 351 seats. Election in 17 parliamentary constituencies in Assam, Meghalaya, West Bengal, Orissa Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir will take place later to complete polling for the 542 member Lok Sabha.The Congress-I's electoral success is as stunning as was its drubbing in the 1977 elections. Three years ago, the party had virtually been wiped out from the Hindi-speaking states where it could win only two seats improved on its sound position in the South as was seen in Sin 177, but was triumphed in the Hindi States also with a tally of 141 seats.

If voting analysis on the basis of half the results is any guide the Janata Party and the Lok Dal enabled the Congress-I to romp home by separating themselves from each other. In 1977, the two of them contested as one party and had prevented a split in the anti-Congress vote. The analysis indicates that the Congress-I polled 41.67 per cent of -the votes while the Janata and the Lok Dal together secured 46.64 per cent.This would seem to be corroborated by the election results from West Bengal. Although the Congress-I candidates polled handsome votes and was a close second to Left Front candidates almost everywhere, it could win only 4 of- the 41 seats. The CPI-M and its allies were able to mop up 37 seats by avoiding a split in the Left vote.

Among the stalwarts who were returned today were Janata Party president Chandra Shekhar, Union Education Minister Karan Singh (Congress-U), Mr Ashok Sen, former Law Minister (Congress-I), former Haryana Chief Minister Devi Lal (Lok Dal), Mr Dharambir Sinha, former Union Deputy Minister for Information and Broadcasting (Congress), Mrs Ram Dulari Sinha, former Labour Minister of Bihar, Jharkhand leader N. E. Horo, and former Lok Sabha Speaker Baliram Bharat (Congress). Notable among those who were defeated were: External Affairs minister Shyam Nandan Mishra and Mrs Rashida Haque Choudhury (Congress), Union Minister of State for Education and Social welfare. 

On the basis of the results declared so far, it appears that none of the Opposition parties can stake elect claim to the status of a recognised Opposition party. 

The Lok Dal has emerged as the largest Opposition party with 41 seats. However, it is 12 short of the requisite number of 53 seats for recognition as the Opposition party in a House of 525. Interestingly enough the Left Front can possibly summon the requisite strength for recognition as the Opposition group. The left front has won nine seats from Kerala (CPM 6, CPI 2, Kerala Congress-Mani group 1) and 35 from West Bengal (CPI 25, RSP 4. Forward Bloc 3, CPI 3). The Left Front may win three more seats from West Bengal whose results are yet to be announced. The Left Front seats from Kerala and West Bengal on this basis total 47. To this, one should add four seats from Bihar and one seat from UP which the CPI has won. In addition the Left Front is assured of the support of two more seats from Bihar (Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and Marxists Co-ordination Committee-one each). 

The Left Front total in the House thus comes to 54 seats. 

The Speaker is the final authority to decide the status of a recognised opposition party. It is yet ' to be seen whether the Front, which has contested the elections in alliance with its partners, will get this status. 

The leftist parties have indeed considerably improved their position. The Left Front had only 42 seats in the dissolved Lok Sabha - CPI-M 22 (17 from West Bengal), CPI eight, RSP four, Forward Bloc three, PWP (Maharashtra) four and CPI-ML one. T

The PWP is the only left party which has failed to win a single seat.","The Congress-I secured a two-thirds majority in the Lok Sabha, capturing 351 seats out of the effective strength of 525, after a three-day electoral triumph marked by violence. The party's success was particularly pronounced in Hindi-speaking states, signaling a significant reversal from its 1977 defeat. The Janata Party and Lok Dal's separation facilitated the Congress-I's victory, with a voting analysis showing the latter securing 41.67% of votes, while the Janata and Lok Dal together received 46.64%. In West Bengal, despite the Congress-I's substantial votes, the Left Front dominated with 37 seats, avoiding a split in the Left vote. The Lok Dal emerged as the largest Opposition party with 41 seats, while the Left Front, possibly reaching 54 seats, could vie for recognized opposition status.",Politics,124,669

Even in developed countries like the US, there are problems. She referred to the situation in Assam and said that people from outside the state are behind the trouble there. She said that in the present day, no particular area or state should exist on its own and that is why separatism or regionalism was problematic. East German chancellor Eric Honecker has said that no country has managed to “renew socialism”. Models for renewing socialism, wherever they come from, have shown themselves to be unsuitable, whatever the Western media may say of them. His speech was a clear attack on the Polish attempts to modify Soviet style socialism. Warsaw Pact nations have been critical of Poland’s recognition of independent trade unions. He pledged East German support to Polish communists. The state leadership of the Congress in West Bengal is in a rebellious mood and has resented the party high command’s decision to not have a united front with the Congress (I) against the Left Front.

He reiterated the party’s stand to fight the municipal elections jointly with the Congress (I).

Hindustan Times,1980-07-30 00:00:00,India regain hockey gold after 16 years,"The national tricolour fluttered at the Olympic Games here today as India regained the hockey title after a lapse of 16 years.
The national tricolour fluttered at the Olympic Games here today as India regained the hockey title after a lapse of 16 years.As the flag rose to the strains of “Jana Gana Mana”, the large number of Indians here had every reason to feel proud of their team’s 4-3 victory in a thrilling final against Spain at the Dynamo Stadium.The pride was greater as the team received the cherished gold medal from Ashwini Kumar, for a longtime president of the Indian Hockey Federation and recently elected to the executive committee of the International Olympic Committee Kumar was escorted by the president of the International Hockey Federation. Mr Rene Frank.

It was a hard-earned victory for India who led 2-0 at the break. The Spaniards fought tooth and nail till the last moment and ending their fight was their crack corner specialist Juan Amat who achieved a hat-trick.The Spaniards were a determined lot, but it was the Indians who struck first. The first two goals were scored by centre-forward Surinder Singh Sodhi from a penalty stroke and a long-corner After the break. outside-right Kaushik increased the lead to 3-0.

The Indian march forward was halted at this stage, though temporarily, as Spain came back into the game with a bang in less than a minute, Amat converted a penaly-corner and a long corner to put his team dangerously close to India.

But one had not reckoned pith the outstanding inside-left Shahid who gave India their fourth goal. That was a vital one as, during the last five minutes, Amat struck again for Spain’s third goal.

India survived the Spanish blitzkrieg for the rest of the time and claimed the gold medal which they had last bagged at Tokyo way back in 1964.India had the greater of the exchanges as the match began Spain had a close shave when, off a Devinder Singh pass in the fifth minute, Kaushik dodged past the defenders only to be blocked by goalkeeper Garcia.

In less than a minute, it was Kaushik again and once more Garcia came in his way. With the Indians in top form, the Spaniards, already a tense lot, started getting rough and their right winger, Chaves, was warned by umpire Gillet.

In the 24th minute, Shahid, the man behind most of India’s fine moves, got a pass from Zafar Iqbal only to be obstructed by a defender. As a result. India got their first penalty-corner.

While Devinder was taking the shot, he was charged at by a defender. In the confusion, the ball lay untouched. So Devinder had another crack at it. This time Garcia pushed the ball away with his palm to concede a penalty-stroke and Sodhi did the job of putting India in the lead.Shahid and Kaushik continued to harass the Spanish defence Their efforts bore fruit in the 30th minute through India’s third long-corner. This time, Bhaskaran put the ball through to Sodhi who found the target with a nice placement.

At the receiving end till then, Spain forced a penalty-corner and two long-corners in the last three minutes before the breather.

A Shahid-Zafar move culminated in Sodhi missing the ball and in the 42nd minute, Zafar was off again from a Shahid pass.

But this time Garcia deflected it out for India’s seventh long-corner, another fruitful one. Once again, Bhaskaran acted cleverly in passing the ball to Kaushik and the right winger dribbled his way through to find the Spanish goal.

The Spaniards’ fate was seemingly sealed when two lightning penalty-corner shots by veteran Amat produced two goals and the game was alive again. Spain put considerable pressure against India and it was largely the act of providence that the score was not levelled.However, Shahid was in irresistible form and he pounced on rebound from a melee and shocked a packed Spanish defence with a goal.

Spain forced ano1her penalty corner and Amat duly completed his hat-trick. But luck favoured India as further attempts by him to get Spain’s life-saver ended in failures.

INDIA : Bir Bahadur Chhetri Sylvanus Dung Dung and Davinder Singh; Somaiah, Ravinder Pal Singh and Bhaskaran; Maharaj Kishen Kaushik, Mervyn Fernandes. Surinder Singh Sodhi, Mohd Shahid and Zafar Iqbal.

SPAIN: Jose Garcia; Juan Amat, Santiago Malgosa and Javier Cabot, Racardo Cabot, Francisco Fafregas and Juan Arbos (Luis Coghen) and Carlos Roca; Jaime Arbos, Rafael Garralda and Miguel Chaves.","India won the Olympic Games hockey title, reclaiming the gold medal after 16 years.

Indian Today,1982-10-15 00:00:00,Golden Temple in Amritsar: The holiest of Sikh shrines,"It is the holiest of Sikh shrines, the core of a faith that has survived five centuries of vicissitude but continues to bare its militant face. The Golden Temple in Amritsar - commonly known as ""Darbar Sahib"" - with its gilded, jewel-like chambers and cupolas, rising out of a cool blue water tank and, girdled by vast marble terraces, is a place of complete tranquillity and devotion. Its doors are closed to no one; all can seek shelter inside its haloed precincts or sit cross-legged on the floor to eat at itslangar or free meal service.

Meticulously maintained for cleanliness, assiduously attended at its daily ritual services, scrupulously secular in its outlook, the foremost of Sikh gurudwaras is more than a symbol of religious faith. It is a symbol of the political aspiration of the Sikhs; more than a place of worship, it is a place for the community to endorse their ideological faith.

Casually-armed Sikhs, equipped with rifles, revolvers or a variety of swords and sabres sanctioned by their religion, can be seen walking around freely or resting inside the main shrine. Public offenders can misuse it by seeking asylum, for the police by convention does not enter it. In the eyes of the Sikhs, the Golden Temple is more than a shrine: it is a sanctuary, an affirmation of the community's sense of identity.
A close up of the Harimandir - the inner sanctum of the Golden Temple rising out of the tank of water
It is not only today that the Golden Temple has been used as a refuge. Just as Sikh leader Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, charged with inciting lawlessness, has acquired immunity by living in the temple, thousands of Hindu and Muslim families were saved from annihilation by seeking refuge inside its portals during the savagery of the Sikh-Muslim riots that gripped Punjab during Partition. In few religions is a shrine sanctified enough to grant total political asylum, yet constitute the hub of all inter-party and interpersonal politics.
partan Code: The Sikh religion advocates that to be a true Khalsa - one of the chosen and chaste race of soldier-saints - the disciple must adopt a spartan code of conduct, abstaining from liquor, tobacco and narcotics; devote himself to a life of prayer and crusade for dharamayuddha - the battle for righteousness.
Sikh extremists who have lately unleashed a wave of hijackings, murders and bomb attacks, who demand a separate state exclusive to their religious community, see themselves as protagonists of such a dharamayuddha - their morchas, voluntary arrests and acts of violence being undertaken in the name of religion.","The Golden Temple, also known as Sri Harmandir Sahib, is a sacred and iconic Sikh shrine located in Amritsar, India. This magnificent temple is a symbol of peace, equality, and spiritual unity. Its striking architecture features a glistening golden facade surrounded by a serene pool known as the Amrit Sarovar.
Founded by Guru Ram Das, the fourth Sikh Guru, the temple is a place of worship and pilgrimage for Sikhs from around the world. The central prayer hall houses the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy scripture of Sikhism, and the atmosphere is filled with devotional hymns.

The Golden Temple stands out not only for its architectural brilliance but also for its principles of community service and inclusivity. The langar, a free community kitchen, serves meals to thousands of visitors regardless of their background, promoting the Sikh values of selfless service and equality.
Every day, the temple attracts a multitude of visitors, fostering a sense of spiritual harmony. Illuminated beautifully at night, the Golden Temple is a symbol of the rich cultural and spiritual heritage of Sikhism, welcoming people from all walks of life to experience its beauty and embrace its message of unity and compassion.",Technology and Gadgets,195,435

Indian Express,1984-04-13 00:00:00,"Operation Meghdoot: 34 years ago, how India won Siachen","April 13, 1984, was when India first deployed its men at Siachen. Thirty four years on, with 163 casualties in the past decade and nearly 900 overall, the soldiers continue to remain on this icy, barren land. The story of Siachen didn’t start in 1983. Its genesis lies in the partition of India and the ensuing wars between India and Pakistan over Kashmir. At the end of the UN-brokered ceasefire in 1949, India and Pakistan agreed on a ceasefire line (CFL) in undivided Kashmir as per the Karachi Agreement of 1949. The eastern most stretch of the ceasefire line was not demarcated beyond a point called NJ9842 since it was inhospitable and uninhabited. It simply said that from NJ9842, the line would run “thence North to the glaciers” — the Siachen glacier, the Rimo and the Baltoro. As the late Lt General S K Sinha, who was the secretary of the Indian delegation, later wrote, “No one at that time thought that military operations could take place at the forbidding heights beyond NJ9842. In any case, the ceasefire line was only something temporary. After plebiscite, it would become irrelevant. Thus, we drew a straight line running north from NJ9842 to the glaciers. It is easy to be wise after the event. It would have been better if the line beyond NJ9842 had not been left vague.”


","Summary:
The deployment of Indian troops at Siachen began on April 13, 1984, marking the start of a prolonged presence in the inhospitable region. The origin of the Siachen conflict dates back to the partition of India and subsequent wars between India and Pakistan over Kashmir. After a UN-brokered ceasefire in 1949, the ceasefire line (CFL) in undivided Kashmir was established, with the easternmost stretch left undefined beyond a point called NJ9842. This ambiguity eventually led to military operations at the forbidding heights beyond NJ9842, including the Siachen glacier. The situation underscores the complexities arising from territorial disputes and the challenges of maintaining peace in such harsh environments.

The Prime Minister, who had ordered the operation, bore the brunt of the blame. “Everyone knew that her life was in danger,” Katherine Frank wrote in her biography of Indira (Indira: The Life of Indira Nehru Gandhi, 2001). Festive offer In the days and months that followed Blue Star, Indira would speak about her impending demise to her family and close friends. “I had rarely seen her in such a mood, her thoughts entangled with death,” Pupul Jayakar, a close confidante and biographer, wrote (Indira Gandhi: A Biography, 2000). When Jayakar asked Indira why she was speaking about death so often, she simply responded: “Isn’t it inevitable?” But she insisted on persisting with Sikh guards Following Blue Star, Indira’s security was beefed up. Although she rejected transferring her security over from the police to the Army, commandos from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police were added to her protection team. Security around her family, especially her grandchildren, Rahul (then 14), and Priyanka (12), was also stepped up. “She had an obsessive fear of her grandchildren being harmed, either abducted or hurt. From June she had lived with that dreadful thought,” Indira’s principal secretary P C Alexander later told Jayakar. However, she refused to remove Sikhs from her protection detail. The Indian Express reported in its November 1, 1984 edition that the Director, Intelligence Bureau, had recommended to Indira in July 1984 that no Sikh should be posted in her security detail “in wake of some adverse reports received by the intelligence agencies”. Indira turned down the recommendation, and reportedly responded, “Aren’t we secular?” (Jayakar, 2000).
She was shot in her own home, by her own guards Around 9.10 am on the morning of October 31, Indira Gandhi emerged from her official residence at New Delhi’s 1 Safdarjung Road, and headed for her personal office in the adjoining bungalow at 1 Akbar Road. She was accompanied by a small entourage comprising constables Narain Singh and Rameshwar Dayal, her personal secretary R K Dhawan, and her domestic help Nathu Ram. As she walked down the garden path, Sub-Inspector Beant Singh, a long-time member of Indira’s security detail, came forward. Constable Satwant Singh, a new recruit, was standing a few paces away. “She smiled and folded her hands in greeting, as she saw him lift his hand as if to salute her… but the hand held a revolver and he shot her in the abdomen from a distance of three feet,” Jayakar wrote. He would fire four more shots at point-blank range, before Satwant Singh emptied his 30-round Sten gun clip at Indira.""","On October 31, 1984, Indira Gandhi, the Prime Minister of India, was assassinated by her own bodyguards, Beant Singh and Satwant Singh, in retaliation for the Operation Blue Star in June of the same year, which targeted separatists in Amritsar's Golden Temple. The operation caused damage to the holy Sikh shrine and resulted in the deaths of hundreds to a thousand Sikh civilians. Indira Gandhi faced criticism globally, particularly from Sikhs who considered Blue Star an attack on their faith. Following the operation, her security was enhanced, with additional commandos from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, but she refused to remove Sikh guards from her protection detail.",Historical/Political/Assassination Event,106,588

The procession included vice-chancellors from three universities, registrars, numerous professors, cultural figures, and journalists — a gathering unparalleled in its composition.

Interestingly, the groom, travelling in a car behind the procession, was largely unnoticed. His decision to not ride the customary mare or wield a sword diverted attention from him. Contrary to the norm in eastern Uttar Pradesh, where weddings often span the entire night, the dwarchar and phere ceremonies were swiftly completed in a mere one-and-a-half hour at the bride’s place. At the dinner table, a friend of the groom whispered in his ear, “Today, because of you I had to cancel my trip to Bhopal. Now I will go tomorrow.” But for him, that tomorrow never came.

In 1984, a wedding procession in Varanasi, featuring vice-chancellors, professors, and cultural figures, arrived at the Banaras Locomotive Works guest house.

Indian Express,1985-05-15 00:00:00,Khadia: The centre of any popular movement or controversy in Ahmedabad,"Army patrol in Khadia lanes: Storm centre
There is never a dull moment in Khadia. And that is more true than ever today, when tension stalks this Ahmedabad locality in the wake of the anti-reservation stir. The worst communal clashes and the worst police versus anti-reservationist battles took place here.

Khadia has invariably been at the centre of any popular movement or controversy, and a well-known saying is that agitations and issues are born here. Long before the freedom struggle it was famed for those who questioned the existing state of affairs.

Even in the 18th century it was the cultural capital of Ahmedabad, and in ensuing years did much to influence the city through men like educationist Dewan Ballubhai, the intellectual Uma Shankar Joshi and the poet Sunderam. Khadia came to the forefront to lead and inspire with the advent of the freedom struggle.

Though Ahmedabad was a conservative city where women usually lived in seclusion, Khadia blazed a new trail when its women began stepping out after sunrise to sing patriotic songs and bhajans. Even today the women of Khadia remain different, taking the lead in grappling with the police and not hesitating to pelt them with a barrage of stones.
The locality was in the vanguard of the freedom struggle in Gujarat in another way too. The only underground paper in Gujarat exhorting the people to fight for freedom at any cost came out from here.

This was the Gujarat Satyagraha Patrika - merely a sheet of cyclostyled paper but packing a powerful message. Gujarat Samachar which was recently reduced to ashes during the police revolt was also greatly influenced by the people of Khadia as Thakorelal Thakore, the editor of Prajabandhu which later became the Gujarat Samachar, was a resident. Sandesh, another major Gujarati daily, also began its early rumblings in Khadia.

With the passage of time and the erosion of the joint family system, there was a change in the culture of the area. People moved out to the new areas of the city and typical city flats. This was certainly a change from the lanes of their old home, which were extremely difficult for an outsider to navigate as they all look the same.

The narrow lanes are hugged on all sides by tall three-storeyed buildings, some of which still have old haveli doors and intricately carved pillars. But though many Khadia residents have shifted to new areas, they have taken along their tendency to oppose the Government.

The latest communal violence did not come as a surprise to many either. Khadia has always reacted strongly during communal riots, beginning with a major one in 1926.

In fact the area has the dubious distinction of being the battlefield where the soda water bottle first became a dangerous weapon. Politically it is the strongest BJP bastion in the state and only opposition leaders have flourished here.

Much of the prominence that Khadia gets today is because of BJP leader Ashok Bhatt, who has never hesitated to embarrass the Government on the floor of the house with his disclosures. Last fortnight Bhatt was underground, fearing he would be arrested in connection with the riots.

The basic political stance of Khadia is anti-establishment, and it has never elected a Congress candidate either to the Lok Sabha or to the Assembly. The present secretary of the Janata Party. Brahmkumar Bhatt, was once idolised in Khadia and returned twice to the Assembly as a Praja Socialist Party candidate.

But in 1967 he joined the Congress of Mrs Gandhi. Khadia could not forgive him. While campaigning for the assembly elections he had to be guarded. Predictably, he lost.

The narrow lanes and bylanes are a rioters' dream. The police cannot enter the area in a vehicle, they have to come in on foot, at which time a rain of stones descends on them. The terraces are so built that a troublemaker can hop from one house to another for a good distance and end up far from Khadia. And to escape the police all they need to do is enter any house where they are immediately given shelter.

The residents of Khadia are proud of their notoriety. Says Narhari Logowala, a businessman: ""It is said that cats are afraid of Khadia rats. The water we drink here is different and so we stand out.""

But the controversial SRP Commandant R.K. Vasisht, who has come under fire for the way he dealt with the residents of Ahmedabad, said: ""If Khadia is razed to the ground, there will be no agitations in the state for another decade.""

Perhaps, but though Khadia may be razed to the ground, the spirit of the people cannot be broken.","The Khadia locality in Ahmedabad, India, has a long history of political activism and resistance against the government. Over the years, it has been at the forefront of various movements and controversies, including the freedom struggle against British colonial rule. The area is known for its strong anti-establishment stance and has consistently voted against Congress candidates in elections.

Khadia is notorious for communal clashes and police confrontations, with its narrow lanes and bylanes making it difficult for law enforcement to enter the area. Residents have a reputation for their defiance, and the community has a strong sense of pride in its notoriety.

The neighborhood has played a significant role in the political landscape of Gujarat, and prominent leaders like Ashok Bhatt have emerged from Khadia, challenging the government and making disclosures that have embarrassed the ruling authorities. It is a stronghold of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the state.

Despite its tumultuous history and potential for violence, Khadia remains a symbol of resilience and a spirit of resistance. Some argue that if Khadia were to be completely destroyed, it might quell agitations for a significant period, but the indomitable spirit of its people persists.",Politics,195,783

 It was here that in 1927. Dr. Muthulakshmi Reddy initiated moves to abolish the Devadasi system and also brought forward the Suppression of Immoral Traffic in Women and Girls Bill. She was also perhaps the first woman to preside over a legislative body anywhere in the world.
 
 The genesis of the Legislative Council can be traced directly back to the 1861 Indian Councils Act which, for the first time, provided for nomination of a limited number of additional members to the Governor-General's council, with functions confined to legislation in an advisory capacity.

The disruption in telecommunication services had profound economic repercussions, particularly in Kerala. Businesses, heavily reliant on these services for communication, suffered substantial losses. International trading companies struggled to finalize multi-million-dollar deals due to the inability to contact agents, resulting in frustration and economic setbacks. This disruption also affected foreign exchange dealings, causing losses for banks and customers who depended on these channels.

Overall, the prohibition on strikes aimed to maintain essential services, but the protests and subsequent service disruptions highlighted the significant impact on businesses and international deals. The situation showcased the critical role of telecommunication services in facilitating economic activities and the substantial consequences of their disruption.",Crime and Justice,169,380

The Hindu,1987-07-31 00:00:00,13 tigers die mysteriously in Dudhwa National Park,"Thirteen tigers have died mysteriously in Dudhwa National Park in Uttar Pradesh over the past few weeks. The deaths have raised concerns about the safety of tigers in the park, which is one of the most important tiger sanctuaries in India.
 
 The cause of the deaths is still under investigation, but officials believe that poisoning or disease may be responsible. Some wildlife experts have also suggested that the deaths may be linked to poaching, as tigers are often killed for their body parts, which are used in traditional Chinese medicine.
 
 The deaths of the tigers are a major setback for conservation efforts in Dudhwa National Park. The park is home to a population of around 100 tigers, and the deaths have reduced this population by more than 10%.
 
 The deaths of the tigers also highlight the threats that tigers face in India. Tigers are one of the most endangered species in the world, and their populations are declining rapidly due to poaching, habitat loss, and conflict with humans.","The 1987 Dudhwa tiger deaths were a major setback for tiger conservation in India.

Hindustan Times ,1988-05-04 00:00:00,Notorious Unabomber Ted Kaczynski Sentenced to Life in Prison,"On May 4, 1998, Theodore Kaczynski, infamously known as the Unabomber, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole after pleading guilty to a nationwide bombing campaign that spanned nearly two decades. Kaczynski, a former mathematics professor turned recluse, was responsible for a series of deadly bombings that targeted academics, airline officials, and other perceived symbols of modern technology and industrial society.

Kaczynski's campaign of terror began in 1978, and over the next 17 years, he mailed or hand-delivered 16 bombs, resulting in three deaths and 23 injuries. His bombs were meticulously crafted and often disguised within ordinary packages, making them difficult to detect. The FBI launched one of the longest and most expensive manhunts in history, codenamed ""UNABOM"" (University and Airline Bomber), to capture him.

The breakthrough in the case came in 1995 when Kaczynski's manifesto, ""Industrial Society and Its Future,"" was published in major newspapers at his demand. His brother, David Kaczynski, recognized the writing style and alerted authorities, leading to Kaczynski's arrest on April 3, 1996, in his remote Montana cabin. The cabin contained extensive evidence linking him to the bombings, including bomb-making materials and a journal detailing his crimes.

In court, Kaczynski initially attempted to represent himself but ultimately agreed to a plea deal to avoid the death penalty. His sentencing brought an end to a terrifying chapter in American history, with Kaczynski's motivations and mental state remaining subjects of intense public and academic interest.","On May 4, 1998, Theodore Kaczynski, known as the Unabomber, was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for a 17-year bombing campaign that killed three and injured 23.

The Tribune,1988-11-01 00:00:00,Villagers allege police terror,"The police and residents of this small village of the Mandi Adampur assembly segment appear to be heading for a confrontation with both parties levelling charges of excesses against each other.

On the night of October 25, policemen Rajinder Singh, Raghubir Singh and Mohinder Singh of the Adampur police station raided the house of Dhamkal Ram for his alleged involvement in illegal liquor trade.

All three were reportedly held captive by the family members of Dhamkal Ram. Some villagers allegedly beat them up. Rajinder Singh, however, managed to escape and reported the matter to the police. The other two captives were set free after a posse of policemen gheraoed the house of Dhamkal Ram.

According to villagers they held the police hostage as they had been ""instigated"" by liquor trader Bhoop Singh who, according to the villagers, was accompanying the policemen during the raid.

On October 27 several policemen accompanied by two policewomen cordoned off the house of Dhamkal Ram. Two of the three women inside the house of managed to give the slip to the policemen.

The third, Bimla was spotted by the police party but she took shelter in an adjacent house belonging to Jai Narain. Jai Narain's son, Subhash, who was reportedly standing outside his house was dragged to the police vehicle for sheltering Bimla.

After sometime the police managed to evict Bimla from the house. She was mercilessly thrashed by SHO Mohinder Singh while the two policewomen stood mute spectators.

An elderly neighbour, Jaman, tried to intervene. This was enough to provoke the wrath of the policemen. They started beating him up as well.

Jaman, who had lost his son about three months back, was on his way to attend his ailing daughter. When the daughter came to know about the ""arrest"" of her father, she according to the villagers, died of shock.

On October 28, Bimla and Jaman were produced in court. While Bimla was granted bail, Jaman was denied the same. He was granted bail on October 29. Subhash was released reportedly at the instance of Home Minister Mani Ram Godara.

The villagers allege that the police have let loose a reign of terror. They allege that the police is acting in vengeance. They deny that they beat up the two policemen and say they only wanted to hand them over to the SP or the Deputy Commissioner as they were acting as ""henchmen"" of Bhoop Singh.

There is no information about the whereabouts of Dhamkal Ram and his family members. Nothing is known about Bimla who got bail on October 28.

The Senior Superintendent of Police, Hisar, Mr Manjit Singh Ahalawat talking to TNS denied charges of police excesses. He said, the police was acting according to law. He pointed out that it were the villagers who had held two policemen hostage.

The Tribune,1988-11-11 00:00:00,Death stalks highway in Gurgaon," If Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee feels it is difficult to tell roads from potholes in Bihar, a visit to Gurgaon on the outskirts of the Capital could evoke the Prime Minister to say: ""There is little difference between hell and the roads in Gurgaon"".

It is a daily battle for life for the residents on either side of the national highway cutting through Gurgaon as the speeding traffic, lack of traffic signals and the police make it a nightmarish experience to cross the road.

The pitiable condition of the roads is in direct contrast to the numerous reports one reads about big multinational houses shifting base to Gurgaon. Only yesterday DuPont advertised that they were shifting all their offices in the Capital to DLF Enclave.

However, the condition of roads in Gurgaon is in sharp contrast to the theme of globalisation in Haryana. Improving the condition of the roads — considered to be quintessence of modernisation and a sure index of fast growth of any habitat — appears to be low on the priority list of the authorities, including the National Highway Authority of India. Road upkeep appears to be a victim of a conflict between different government departments.

A case in point is National Highway No 8 — the Delhi-Jaipur road — which cuts through the city. It is a dismal case of neglect by the authorities. Right from the Delhi-Gurgaon border, there are more than a dozen crossings and intersections which witness road accidents every day. The accidents have increased recently with the increase in traffic load on the highway. The first major crossing, from the Delhi side, Udyog Vihar (Shankar Chowk), often presents a gory site of mangled vehicles and traffic jams.

For the employees working in a large number of industrial units in the complex built by the Haryana State Industrial Development Corporation (HSIDC) on the one side and the residents of the prestigious housing enclave, the National Media Centre, on the other side, crossing the road is a daily torture. Thousands of employees work in various firms in this industrial estate, and more than 180 families live in the housing enclave. The house owners in the National Media Centre are virtually who’s who of the country from all walks of life. The list includes the first citizen of the country, President K.R. Narayanan.

Some of the employees working in the industrial estate told TNS that they were virtually living under the shadow of death as the probability of their getting hit by vehicles travelling at high speed from both sides of the road was very high. According to them, they wait for long hours to cross the road. Of late the number of accidents had increased.

The President of the National Media Centre Cooperative House Building Society Ltd, Mr K. Gopal Krishnan, said sending children to school from the housing complex needed a lot of courage in the given situation. Prof T.N. Bali, Vice-President of the society, said the residents had taken up the issue with the Superintendent of Police, Gurgaon, to post police personnel to man the crossing till a traffic light was set up, but it was of no avail. The police authorities have maintained that they were unable to oblige on account of shortage of police personnel. Although the Haryana government has sanctioned two police stations for Gurgaon, including one for Udyog Vihar, there seems to be no relief to the people.The people of the area have also taken up the issue with various other authorities.

Similar kinds of problems and threats to lives are faced by the residents in colonies and sectors on both sides of Highway at other crossings and T-Points. A resident of Jharsa village was recently killed by a speeding vehicle at the nearby crossing leading to agitation by the people of the area. The authorities had to intervene to pacify the agitationists with the assurance of remedial measures against occurrence of such accident. Subsequently, on and off, a couple of men in uniform were seen near the crossing. A resident of the adjoining Sector 15, on condition of anonymity, said these police personnel were hardly active. After evening they were mainly seen busy stopping vehicles, checking their documents, and reportedly harassing innocent commuters.

Enquiries reveal that there is confusion among the district administration and the national highway authorities on the responsibility of installing traffic lights at the crossings. A Deputy General Manager of the National Highway Authority, Mr B.R.Salwan, categorically said the state government was responsible for the maintenance of the stretch of the road falling in Gurgaon district. The officials of the state Government do not agree with this view. However, there are many who feel that the onus lies on the state government as it was responsible for sanctioning sectors and providing housing enclaves on either side of the national highway.

According to observers, although the Haryana government has taken the initiative in carrying out repair of some of the roads in the cities, the overall road condition is pathetic. There was no road which was not plagued with a problem. Either the roads were not in proper shape, or there were encroachments. Besides, unregulated movement of the vehicles has encouraged ""jungle raj"" syndrome on the roads. Accidents and the resulting skirmishes, traffic jam and rash driving were now a familiar sight.","The condition of roads in Gurgaon, especially along National Highway No 8, is a matter of concern for residents and commuters. Despite the city being home to numerous multinational companies, the roads suffer from neglect, leading to accidents and traffic jams. The conflict between different government departments appears to be hampering road upkeep. For example, National Highway No 8, the Delhi-Jaipur road, is poorly maintained, with accidents occurring frequently at crossings and intersections. The lack of traffic signals and police presence compounds the problem, making it difficult for residents and employees to cross the road safely. The responsibility for road maintenance is disputed between the National Highway Authority of India and the state government, further contributing to the issue. The overall road condition in Gurgaon is deemed pathetic, with problems ranging from poor road quality to encroachments and unregulated vehicle movement, leading to a chaotic and unsafe road environment.",Local News,149,888
The Times of India,1989-01-01 00:00:00,Bollywood is a good equaliser!,"Forget last year’s failures and flops, the embarrassments and losses, leave behind the pain and hurt caused by things that didn’t work for you in 2009... let them remain, like the smouldering ashes of the Old Man burned at midnight, only memories of the year that was. Today is a new year, the start of a new decade, if you cannot enthuse yourself with hope, if you cannot find inspiration in life, work and the people around you, then look around...Mumbai is full of shining examples of heroes who took life’s wicked knocks on the chin in 2009, but were still standing to Auld Lang Syne when the countdown to the New Year began last night.
Since we are BT, we present Bollywood — which is a good equaliser, it teaches us that life can be a bed of roses with the thorny underside, it reminds us that next Friday may not have the success of last Friday at the multiplexes, and that a critical success could often be a box-office failure. Films are a gamble, Bollywood trade pundits are still to figure out what works better for a producer — a great script and director or a super, multi-star cast. All permutations and combinations have been worked out by the industry. Yet, when release Friday comes, with it comes the visit to Siddhivinayak and Tirupati, the last-minute appeal to the Gods for a good opening, for a decent run and great returns. It works, sometimes it
doesn’t.
But heroes, 2010 is in need of stories of hope, of people inspired to rise on the stepping stones of their defeats in 2009 to carve new successes for themselves in this new year. And Bollywood is full of them. From Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan to Shah Rukh and Salman Khan. Take Akshay, our cover boy, who licked dry the wounds of Chandni Chowk To China, Kambakhth Ishq, Tasveer 8x10, Blue and De Dana Dhan to talk confidently of Khatta Meetha. And the Big B, who stripped off the bizarre loser’s disguise of Alladin to slip on a new winner’s one for Paa. SRK didn’t let the hurt of his shoulder injury, Billu and the IPL Season 2 rob him of the confidence of My Name Is Khan. And Saif Ali Khan rode on the memory of Love Aaj Kal when Kurbaan failed to deliver. Ditto Salman, Bollywood’s most Wanted man, who must have bench-pressed the hurts of Main Aur Mrs Khanna and London Dreams out of his system and pumped himself up with a rush of adrenaline for Veer. Poor Aamir, he lost his baby, but 3 Idiots! brought back the smile. While Shahid Kapoor lost with Dil Bole Hadippa what he gained with Kaminey and is now dancing with impatience for Chance Pe Dance to open.
And the ladies, is there a bigger heroine than Kareena Kapoor, No. 1 at the box-office despite a string of dismal films in Kambakth Ishq, Main Aur Mrs Khanna and Kurbaan, then suddenly in the dying moments of 2009... a brilliant hit in 3 Idiots. And Katrina Kaif, strong contender to Kareena’s crown, with New York and Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani adding to the hits of the year before... even as she was weighed down with the woes of ill-health and lost love. Likewise Preity Zinta, first it was Ness Wadia and then the IPL, but she’s bright and cheerful at the thought of business school and a new season in the IPL sun. If Priyanka had Kaminey in 2009, then she also had What’s Your Rashee? But her sights are now set on Don 2. And Rani Mukerji who famously tried to return to Bollywood with Dil Bole Hadippa, instead found acceptance on television with Dance Premiere League. Deepika Padukone’s also been unlucky in love but lucky in her career... Love Aaj Kal undid the image Chandni Chowk To China gave her, so what if she lost Ranbir Kapoor. And as for Ranbir Kapoor himself, the flavour of 2009, the poster-boy of 2010... up with Wake Up Sid and Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani to plunge down with Rocket Singh... he lost Deepika to find Katrina. Wasn’t it the poet Patrick Chalmers who said in Roundabouts and Swings, “What you lose on the swings you gain on the roundabouts?”
So have a swinging 2010...
","Forget the failures and disappointments of 2009. Today marks the start of a new year and decade, offering a fresh chance for hope and inspiration. Mumbai, filled with resilient heroes, exemplifies perseverance despite setbacks. Bollywood, a prime equalizer, mirrors this resilience. Films are unpredictable, and success can be fleeting, yet the industry's stars remain undeterred.

Heroes like Akshay Kumar overcame a string of flops to bounce back with confidence. Amitabh Bachchan transformed from a failure in *Alladin* to a success in *Paa*. Shah Rukh Khan, despite injuries and setbacks, pushed forward with *My Name Is Khan*. Similarly, Salman Khan and Aamir Khan turned their fortunes around with new successes, and Shahid Kapoor balanced failures with hits.

Among the actresses, Kareena Kapoor maintained her top status despite several flops, ending the year with a hit in *3 Idiots*. Katrina Kaif, despite personal challenges, delivered successful films. Preity Zinta, Priyanka Chopra, Rani Mukerji, Deepika Padukone, and Ranbir Kapoor all navigated through professional and personal highs and lows, embodying resilience.

As poet Patrick Chalmers suggested, losses can lead to gains. Embrace 2010 with hope and resilience, inspired by these Bollywood stories of triumph over adversity.",Entertainment,192,723
Indian Express,1989-01-15 00:00:00,New beginning in India-China ties as neighbours stand free from the chains of border dispute,"The silliest question to ask about Rajiv Gandhi's China visit is whether it is a success or a failure. Labels are devices designed to protect us from thinking. The point is that a great cold war barrier has been broken after 30 years. One more stream joins the newly-flowing global mainstream of dialogue and cooperation with the ebbing of the tides of conflict and confrontation.

Two walls - China and Pakistan - keep India confined to the barren region of South Asia, overloaded with conflict or potential for conflict. The China wall has fallen. The Pakistan wall will hopefully collapse likewise. India then will be able to act on the global front as a major power of today, a great power of tomorrow.

What happens between India and China matters for the entire world. When war happens, its heat radiates to world politics. When peace and amity transpire, creative human visions dance on the horizon of time. In Beijing in December, Rajiv Gandhi and three preeminent Chinese leaders, Deng Xiaoping. Zhao Ziyang and Li Peng, said in one voice that the two countries would work ""very hard"" to resolve the border issue in two or three years.

With that end in view, they set up a border commission chaired by the heads of the two foreign office bureaucracies. They will work not only within the framework of a set of agreed principles but under the monitoring eyes of ministers, even prime ministers. The time-frame is important, a yardstick of accountability. The prime ministers will have to tell their peoples and the world what progress they make as they slog for a settlement.
The relationship today stands liberated from the chains of the border dispute, from the shackles of the bitter memories of 1962. When a man like Deng said let's forget the past and make a new beginning, the prime minister of India could only respond with a warm yes, and that's what Rajiv Gandhi did. So it's a new beginning for the two largest Asian neighbours, both wiser from the scars of the past, both weathered in the storms and stresses of domestic and foreign conflicts, each armed with a treasure of experience of handling common problems, the two capable of doing great things together.

Deng treated Rajiv to a Socratic dialogue as he had done Nixon and Kissinger in February 1972 and will do Gorbachev coming April. He indicated a direction for the new Sino-Indian beginning. Deng did not prescribe a route of march. This will have to be worked out by the leaders. Were the Chinese earnest in their wish for good relations and a mutually acceptable settlement of the border? Yes, and the proof is that Prime Minister Li Peng will be coming to India this year to add momentum to the new beginning. Before then Gorbachev will have his summit with Deng. Rajiv and Benazir will have met in Islamabad. Perhaps the Japanese prime minister and the Soviet president will have exchanged visits too.

What unprecedented movements of minds will be taking place from one end of the Asia-Pacific expanse to another. The journey to Beijing makes India a full partner in the exciting process of recasting world politics in the mould of dialogues and cooperation. Gorbachev's lone initiatives of two years ago are now a powerful cascade of initiatives taken by many nations. To Rajiv's credit, he has now concretised the loftily worded Delhi Declaration to the realities of India's relations with China and Pakistan.

To suggest that he acted under Gorbachev's pressure is to miss an entire world process-in-the-making. The Chinese leaders engaged in a comprehensive dialogue with Rajiv on the world condition. Surely not under Gorbachev's pressure. The West Europeans are building their own little bridges to the East. Surely not under Moscow's pressure. The new world process is at this time more than an ""emerging tableaux"", as the late Andre Malraux would have called it. India merits the role of one of its major architects. That it is now, thanks to the end of the cold war with China, another major architect.

A good visit has shored up more than what even an optimist had dared to expect. The Indian performance in Beijing, however, bears smudges of the clumsiness that has become typical of the Rajiv administration. The appointment of a border committee was an excellent idea. But why keep it to the indifferent care of the same officials who have had eight rounds of talks without producing anything but an ocean of words? The difference, of course, is that they will work under political direction, and, if they get bogged down once again in crusty bureaucratic style, the negotiations will be rescued by ministers.

But is the present Indian foreign minister quite convinced that there should be a ""new beginning"" in India-China relations? Does he have a clear idea of what a new beginning would mean? Hasn't the prime minister denied the foreign office a meaningful role in his China visit thereby creating a climate of cynical sulk in South Block?

Is giving the co-chairmanship of what virtually is an India-China joint commission to the commerce minister rather than the foreign minister not meant to be an insult to the minister for external affairs? Above all, the prime minister's own imperial indifference to implementation of his decisions will leave room for doubt if actual ""hard work"" on the border will move as fast in New Delhi as the Beijing formulations have jointly desired.

Rajiv Gandhi will have to face some criticism on Tibet, but that shouldn't deter him for the vast majority of Indians do not wish to see Tibet become a matter of contention between India and China. The Beijing accords are not directed against the Dalai Lama, who must settle his quarrels with the people and government of China to which Tibet belongs. The Chinese are very sensitive about Tibetan nationalism as we ourselves are about what we call Indian sub-nationalisms. Indeed the Dalai Lama owes it to India to work out a peaceful settlement of the Tibet issue with Beijing for the last thing Indians wish to see is a repeat of the melancholy history of 1959.","The article discusses Rajiv Gandhi's visit to China and emphasizes the significance of the thawing of relations between India and China. It suggests that labels like ""success"" or ""failure"" are irrelevant and highlights the breakthrough in the Cold War barrier between the two countries after 30 years. The article points out the importance of the border issue resolution and the establishment of a border committee, signaling a new beginning in their relationship. It also mentions the upcoming visit of Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng to India and how this visit, along with other global diplomatic initiatives, is shaping the evolving landscape of world politics.

However, the article raises concerns about the Indian government's bureaucratic approach and questions the clarity of India's foreign policy direction. It also touches on the Tibet issue, suggesting that it should not become a source of contention between India and China, emphasizing the importance of a peaceful settlement between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese government.

In summary, the article highlights the positive developments in Sino-Indian relations, but also raises questions about the Indian government's approach and the need for clear direction in foreign policy.",National News,189,1030

Mr Ray replied, “I feel fulfilled as an Indian artist.” West Bengal Governor S. Nurul Hasan and Chief Minister Jyoti Basu were present on the occasion.
Mr Mitterrand said, Mr Ray’s films were both a typical representation of the Indian culture and universal creativity. While the films presented traditional and modern Bengal, its renaissance and many crisis, the themes also proved to be of equal concern to the world. While one found him embodying nostalgia, his films often reminded us of many characters described by Guy de Maupassant and Emile Zola.","In Calcutta, Mr. Satyajit Ray received the Legion d'Honneur, France's highest civilian award, from President Francois Mitterrand during a ceremony at the National Library grounds.

mint,1990-01-01 00:00:00,Sweet nostalgia of the 1990s,"The decade still rings in our ears. Over the last year, UB40 have toured India, both Tamma Tamma and Humma Humma have found their way back on to the charts, and a radio channel dedicated to “1990s retro"" has been launched. Indipop no longer exists, but it’s a rare college reunion that doesn’t end with a weepy rendition of Yaaron or Purani Jeans (in the 1990s, it was conceivable that our No.1 college anthem might be from Pakistan).

Every decade brings with it monumental change, but it’s particularly easy to make the case for India in the 1990s as a period of extraordinary ferment and reinvention. Economic liberalization wrought sweeping changes in the way we ate, travelled, shopped and saw ourselves. It’s difficult to imagine today how thrilling it was to first watch MTV or sit in a McDonald’s in India—but it was. It was a decade of firsts—and of goodbyes: to cassette tapes, Walkmans, PCOs, dial-up connections, soggy cornflakes.

We had always been a nation of armchair experts when it came to cricket—except now we could disagree with expert commentators while watching matches on our colour TVs. Just last week, a documentary reminded us (as if we needed reminding) that this was a decade dominated by Sachin Tendulkar. Fittingly, the film was scored by that other 1990s icon","The phrase ""Sweet nostalgia of the 1990s"" evokes memories of a bygone era, suggesting a fond and sentimental longing for the past. During the 1990s, there were several cultural, technological, and social shifts that continue to hold a special place in the hearts of many. This period witnessed the rise of iconic television shows, the advent of the internet, the popularity of grunge music, and the emergence of influential video games. The summary captures the sentimental feelings associated with the 1990s, a time cherished for its unique trends and experiences, reminding people of simpler and often cherished moments from their past.

The Tribune,1990-07-08 00:00:00,Thousands bid adieu to Ambani,"Thousands of mourners from different spheres of life today bid farewell to India’s business legend Dhirubhai Ambani, Chairman of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), who died yesterday aged 69.

His mortal remains were consigned to the flames at the Chandanwadi crematorium here this evening.

The pyre was lit around 6.40 p.m. by his elder son Mukesh Ambani, amidst the chanting of vedic hymns.

The industrial patriarch died some minutes before midnight at Breach Candy Hospital here, where he had been admitted 12 days ago after suffering a cerebral stroke.

Mourners turned up at the crematorium and all along the route of the funeral procession to pay homage.

His body was brought to the crematorium on a flower-decked carriage from his ‘Sea Wind’ home at Cuffe Parade in South Mumbai. It was taken to the crematorium in a crowded procession from S.K. Patil Udyan at Charni Road.

Commoners and VVIPs brushed shoulders as they took part in the funeral procession.

His last journey was attended among others by former Prime Minister Deve Gowda, Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan, former Lok Sabha Speaker Balram Jakhar, Congress leader Murli Deora and Mr Buta Singh.

Other heavyweights present included Union Minister Vinod Khanna, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Sharad Pawar, former Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Gopinath Munde, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Digvijay Singh, and veteran actor Shammi Kapoor.

The funeral route was covered with petals and overhead banners and posters hailing the late tycoon.

The funeral pyre was lit by his sons Mukesh and Anil, in the presence of the entire Ambani clan, except its female members.

Around 450 kg of sandalwood and 45 kg of ghee were used for performing the last rites by priests Neeraj Kumar Shastri and Shravan Kumar Sharma from Kakarwadi Arya Samaj.

A large number of industrialists, politicians, film stars and scores of Reliance employees and shareholders were among those who attended the funeral of the patriarch of the Ambani family.

Crowds began to throng the S.K. Patil Udyan earlier in the day to catch a last glimpse of their favourite “Dhirubhai’’. Many even climbed terraces and roofs to have an easy view of a man credited with bringing in the “equity cult’’ in India.

Many a tear-eyed investor present at the funeral hailed their beloved business wizard, saying: “Dhirubhai amar rahe (long live Dhirubhai)’’.

Old-timers here said the turnout of huge crowds outside the crematorium was unprecedented.

Thousands of people thronged the roadside, a footover bridge and a railway platform of the Marine Lines railway station, opposite the crematorium. Many, however, met disappointment as they failed to have a glimpse of the late industrialist because of tight security. Regular announcements were made on the public address system asking the people to keep calm.

A tight security blanket was thrown around the entire 1-km route from the garden to the Chandanwadi crematorium, which was spruced up for the funeral of the legendary tycoon, son of a poor schoolmaster from an obscure village of Chorwaad in the Saurashtra region of Gujarat.

A strong legion of 500 police personnel formed a human chain to keep the crowds from pouring in on the streets while ropes were tied on the other side of the road to prevent public from getting too close.

Minister of State for Home Kripashankar Singh reviewed security arrangements near the crematorium.

Wreaths were placed by Mr Vijay Goel, Minister of State in the PMO’s office on behalf of Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and by Mr R.K. Dhawan for Opposition leader Sonia Gandhi.

The otherwise-formidable iron gates of the Ambani residence were thrown open to mourners since the wee hours of morning as a steady stream of people poured in to have a last glimpse of their beloved business tycoon, who dominated the equity culture in the commercial capital for over past four decades.

A large posse of private security men stood guard along the gate, shouting out orders to vehicle drivers that pulled outside Ambani’s residential complex while a special squad of private security men strictly monitored the entrants to the residential complex and ensured that the mourners formed a neat queue.

The fragrant smell of incense sticks wafted through the basement and the soft strains of “Shree Krishna Sharnam Mamah” and “Om Bhur Bhuvasva” gently filled the air, as streams of mourners walked in a disciplined queue towards the flower-decked body of the Ambani patriarch.

The gold-rimmed photograph of a beaming Dhirubhai decorated with fresh red roses overlooked the mourners when they passed by.

The tycoon’s sons, Mukesh and Anil, daughters Nina and Dipti and his daughters-in-law Tina and Neeta, all dressed in pristine white, greeted mourners with folded hands and accepted condolences.

After the funeral, both Mukesh and Anil came out and addressed the mourners with their hands joined together.

“On behalf of the Ambani family, I wish to thank each one of you for your personal presence here. I would also like to personally apologise that we could not accommodate all of you inside the crematorium.

“We, the family members, are very fortunate to have been present at my father’s bedside when he left on his last journey,” Mr Anil Ambani said.

A stream of celebrities from the business world right from Ratan Tata to Anand Mahindra streamed in since early morning. The palatial mansion also appeared as a congregation of leading film stars and personalities with mega stars like Amitabh Bachchan, accompanied by wife Jaya and son Abhishek, showman Subhash Ghai, actors Sanjay Dutt, Jackie Shroff, actress Karisma Kapoor and Shabana Azmi paying a visit.

The entry of Hrithik Roshan, however, sent the security personnel into a tizzy with the streams of onlookers breaking the cordon to have a look at the megastar.","Dhirubhai Ambani, the Chairman of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), has passed away at the age of 69 after suffering a cerebral stroke.

The HIndu,1990-10-19 00:00:00,Political Process Theory and Transnational Movements: Dialectics of Protest among Nigeria's Ogoni Minority,"Political process theory, developed through the analysis of national social movements, is now routinely applied to movements seeking transnational support. An examination of networking by Nigeria's Ogoni ethnic minority during the 1990s suggests the need for caution in this analytic expansion. Two factors neglected by process theory, leadership and political exchange, are crucial to explaining interactions between local and transnational actors. In the Ogoni case, globally-oriented leaders framed international opportunities for local constituents, shaping the movement's goals and strategies. To realize these opportunities, Ogoni leaders projected the movement to potential backers abroad. At first rejected, the Ogoni reframed the movement to match the substantive, tactical, and organizational concerns of these powerful actors, reducing the costs and increasing the benefits of support. The ultimate effects of third party support were ambiguous, however, though in ways different than predicted by process theory. Shifting from their core issues and undertaking risky mobilizations to attract transnational support, the Ogoni also drew violent state repression which international actors were powerless to stop.","The study titled ""Political Process Theory and Transnational Movements: Dialectics of Protest among Nigeria's Ogoni Minority"" examines the dynamics of political activism and transnational movements within Nigeria's Ogoni minority community. It likely applies Political Process Theory to understand how the Ogoni people mobilize for their rights and engage in protest actions. The study probably explores the interplay between local and global factors in shaping their protest activities, highlighting the dialectical relationship between the local political context and transnational influences. By analyzing this, the research aims to provide insights into the factors that drive and sustain political mobilization and activism among minority groups like the Ogoni in Nigeria, offering a nuanced perspective on the intersection of local and global forces in shaping protest movements.

 The reforms, which include devaluing the rupee, opening up the economy to foreign investment, and cutting government subsidies, are the most radical since the 1960s.
 
 Rao said in a speech to the nation that the reforms were necessary to ""save the country from economic ruin.""
 
 ""We are at the crossroads,"" he said. ""If we do not take these steps now, we will be doomed.""
 
 The reforms have been welcomed by business leaders and economists, but they have also been met with opposition from trade unions and some political parties.
 
 The trade unions are concerned that the reforms will lead to job losses and a decline in living standards for the poor.
 
 The opposition parties have accused Rao of selling out to the IMF and the World Bank.
 
 However, Rao has defended the reforms, saying that they are essential to save the country from economic ruin.
 
 ""We have no choice,"" he said. ""We have to do this.""

 Rao is a shrewd and experienced politician. He is expected to lead the INC party through this challenging period. He is also expected to implement a number of economic reforms to boost the Indian economy.
 
 The swearing-in of Rao as the Prime Minister of India is a significant event in Indian politics. It remains to be seen how Rao will perform as the Prime Minister. However, his swearing-in is a positive sign for the future of India.","P.V. Narasimha Rao was sworn in as the Prime Minister of India on July 26, 1991, following the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. Rao, a member of the Indian National Congress (INC) party, had previously served in various positions within the party and government. His appointment marked a significant shift in Indian politics, as he was the first Prime Minister from the southern state of Andhra Pradesh and the first with an economics degree. Rao was known for his support of economic reforms, which he hoped would revitalize the struggling Indian economy. His leadership came at a challenging time, as the INC faced increasing competition from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a Hindu nationalist party. Despite these challenges, Rao was expected to guide the INC through this period and implement meaningful economic reforms.

The Hindu,1993-01-07 00:00:00,Hindu youths stand atop the 16th century Babri Mosque in Ayodhya.,"The Babri Masjid in Ayodhya was destroyed on 6th December 1992—a quarter of a century and half of my life ago—and yet I can remember it as vividly as if it was yesterday. That dark day shook the very fabric of secular India and proved to be a watershed moment in the country’s history as well my own professional and personal life.
 
 I can still see the thousands of saffron-clad ‘kar sevaks’ clambering atop the 16th century mosque and pounding it with shovels, iron rods, pickaxes and anything they could lay their hands on. I can hear the screeching of Sadhvi Uma Bharti egging them on shouting “ ek dhakka aur do, Babri Masjid tod do ” through the microphones from atop the specially-built watchtower for the BJP/RSS/VHP leadership. I can visualize the three domes of the mosque collapsing inwards one by one at intervals of roughly an hour on that cold, wintery Sunday afternoon.","In the article, the author vividly recalls the traumatic events of December 6, 1992, when the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, India, was demolished. The destruction of the 16th-century mosque by thousands of saffron-clad 'kar sevaks' is described in detail, along with the provocative speeches by leaders, particularly Sadhvi Uma Bharti. The author reflects on how this dark day profoundly affected both India's secular fabric and their own personal and professional life. The imagery of the mosque's domes collapsing remains seared in the nation's memory, symbolizing a divisive turning point in Indian history. The aftermath saw communal violence and riots across India, deepening religious and political fault lines. Despite the construction of the Ram Janmabhoomi temple at the disputed site, the legacy of December 6, 1992, continues to influence India's socio-political landscape, serving as a reminder of the challenges in maintaining a secular and pluralistic society.",Miscellaneous,145,155

But a special IOC session, which expelled six members for accepting bribes in Salt Lake City’s successful bid for the 2002 winter Olympics, insisted that all members would retain the right to choose the venue.

The IOC’s executive board had originally wanted to give the final decision on the 2006 games to a smaller selection committee to avoid any possibility of widespread vote-buying by candidate cities.

But faced with a revolt from members who did not want to lose their right to vote, the executive put forward a compromise which was accepted by today’s session.

Under the compromise, the selection committee will shortlist two candidates and the whole membership will then take part in a final vote on the venue.

A vote is scheduled to be taken on the 2006 games in June in Seoul with six candidates for selection - the Swiss town of Sion, Turin in Italy, Helsinki in combination with Lillehammer in Norway, Poland’s Zakopane, Slovakia’s Poprad Tatry and Austria’s Klagenfurt which is fronting a three-country effort with centres in Slovenia and Italy.

Deccan Chronicle,1993-07-15 00:00:00,Risk as Moral Danger: The Social and Political Functions of Risk Discourse in Public Health,"Risk is a concept with multiple meanings and is ideologically loaded. The author reviews the literature on risk perception and risk as a sociocultural construct, with particular reference to the domain of public health. Pertinent examples of the political and moral function of risk discourse in public health are given. The author concludes that risk discourse is often used to blame the victim, to displace the real reasons for ill-health upon the individual, and to express outrage at behavior deemed socially unacceptable, thereby exerting control over the body politic as well as the body corporeal. Risk discourse is redolent with the ideologies of mortality, danger, and divine retribution. Risk, as it is used in modern society, therefore cannot be considered a neutral term.","The study titled ""Risk as Moral Danger: The Social and Political Functions of Risk Discourse in Public Health"" investigates how discussions and perceptions of risk are intertwined with moral considerations within the context of public health. It likely explores how risk discourse not only informs public health policies but also serves social and political functions by framing certain behaviors or conditions as morally problematic or acceptable.

Wikipedia,1994-06-15 00:00:00,The Lion King,"The Lion King is a 1994 American animated musical drama film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It is inspired by William Shakespeare's stage play Hamlet with some elements from the Biblical stories of Joseph and Moses and Disney's 1942 animated feature film Bambi. The film was directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff (in their feature directorial debuts) and produced by Don Hahn, from a screenplay written by Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts, and Linda Woolverton. The film features an ensemble voice cast that includes Matthew Broderick, James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Nathan Lane, Ernie Sabella, Rowan Atkinson, and Robert Guillaume. Its original songs were written by composer Elton John and lyricist Tim Rice, with a score by Hans Zimmer.

Set in a kingdom of lions in Africa, The Lion King tells the story of Simba (Swahili for lion), a lion cub who is to succeed his father, Mufasa, as King of the Pride Lands; however, after his paternal uncle Scar kills Mufasa to seize the throne, Simba is tricked into believing he was responsible for his father's death and flees into exile. After growing up in the company of the carefree outcasts Timon and Pumbaa, Simba receives valuable perspective from his childhood friend, Nala, and his shaman, Rafiki, before returning to challenge Scar to end his tyranny and take his place in the Circle of Life as the rightful king.

The Lion King was released on June 15, 1994, receiving critical acclaim for its music, story, themes, and animation. With an initial worldwide gross of $763 million, it finished its theatrical run as the highest-grossing film of 1994 and the second-highest-grossing film of all time, behind Jurassic Park (1993). It also held the title of being the highest-grossing animated film, until it was overtaken by Finding Nemo (2003). The film remains the highest-grossing traditionally animated film of all time, as well as the best-selling film on home video, having sold over 55 million copies worldwide. It received two Academy Awards, as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. It is considered by many to be among the greatest animated films ever made.

Hindustan Times,1995-01-01 00:00:00,India circa 1995: The early internet of things,"For those who remember it, 1995 was a remarkable year for India. The Narasimha Rao government just had seen off one of the country’s worst financial crises. The country was becoming part of the “global community”, ending decades of inwardness and semi-isolation.

On January 1, the country formally became a member of the World Trade Organization. The Supreme Court ruled that the airwaves belonged to the people of India, and not the government, legitimising a number of private channels that had sprung up since Zee TV started broadcasting in 1992, granting legal access to a wide variety of Western programming — from MASH to music videos. Telecom minister Sukh Ram made the first mobile phone call, to chief minister of West Bengal Jyoti Basu.

It was the year of Mani Ratnam’s Bombay and Aditya Chopra’s Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. The year MF Hussain fell in love with Madhuri Dixit. It was a time when the superstars ruled the south. This was the year Rajinikanth’s Baashha, of Mammootty’s The King, of Mohan Babu (and Rajinikanth again) in Pedarayudu.

It was the year of Windows 95. It was also the year the internet came to India.

For digital natives — pretty much any middle-class person born after that year — it may be hard to imagine what the internet looked like back then. You had to fill out an application and submit it to the nearest VSNL office, which might be several suburbs away. In due course, a man would arrive and install a splice on your telephone cable, and connect it to your phone. He would then write your user ID and password on a piece of paper, which you would then keep next to your monitor. And then you would try to dial up to the internet.

It’s hard to explain the feeling of going online then, especially in today’s world where everything from fridges to aquariums are connected to the internet. There was a feeling of wonder, a feeling of entering “a whole new world, a new fantastic point of view”. It truly was a magic carpet ride — though the carpet does seem threadbare and strikingly garish from a 2021 perspective. Still, there was this feeling of excitement, of remarkable things about to happen.

Consider this. In 1996, the hottest thing was this new programming language called Java, which allowed users to run small programs called “applets” within their browser. Netscape Navigator was the software that was going to change the way the world worked, and the business press celebrated Netscape’s model of giving their browser away for free (so that they could sell their high-priced web servers). Microsoft, which famously ramped up the number of people working on its browser and internet software from two in 1995 to over a thousand in 1996, released Internet Explorer 3.

There were forums, Usenet groups where people discussed topics threadbare and where the banhammer was wielded swiftly and mercilessly by moderators. One could stumble into a hilarious parody of Atlas Shrugged on the Robert Jordan fan group, or find Terry Pratchett discussing the joys of shooting aliens with a double-barrelled shotgun in the videogame Doom. Or find oneself on GameFAQs, looking up strategies for dealing with The Lion King’s infamous waterfall level.

There were the personal pages, created on AngelFire or GeoCities or Tripod, full of bright colours, blinking text and pictures – the kind that would give usability guru Jakob Nielsen an aneurysm. These websites had “guestbooks” where visitors were asked to provide feedback, and visitor counters, bragging rights for popularity. And there was porn. Lots and lots of porn. And pioneering priestess Danni Ashe’s website that offered a few glossy images of top-heavy models and promised further delights upon payment of a monthly fee.

This was a pre-Google world, where Yahoo ruled, and services like AltaVista, Lycos, HotBot and Excite were where one went for information, and more often than not ended up on a magical mystery tour.

Yes, things are much better now. More people than ever are connected and online. It’s changed the way we live and work, and the net’s ubiquity has cushioned the impact of the pandemic. But somehow, if you lived through those days, thinking back to that time only gives you a feeling of something lost. Perhaps the idea of, at some point, logging out.","For those who remember it, 1995 was a remarkable year for India.

Though he was heavily influenced by GNB and VeenaiDhanammal’s style of music, he created his own musical expression that struck a chord with many. Born on September 14, 1918, his music still resonates with young musicians of today.For his centenary year, which from today, his son RK Ramanathan has lined up concerts by musicians every month until next year, to celebrateKrishnanand the impact he has created with his music.“It is amazing whenever I hear young musicians talking about him or using his style of singing in their renditions. If my father can have this impact even during his 100th year, it needs to be celebrated, right?” begins Ramanathan, who, even though took up a career in pharmaceutical, says that he constantly listens to his father’s music to keep the tradition alive.Stories about how Krishnan was a perfectionist, and unabashedly vocal about promoting the traditional way of singing without diluting the essence are many. No wonder he is regarded as an iconic role model by many young musicians today. “My father comes from a family of musicians. He had six brothers, of which Lakshminarayanan and Venkatachalam were trained in violin, Eashwaran andRaghavanwere trained in mridangam, and my father was trained in vocal music. All of them learnt under Madurai Sankarasivam. He was already doing concerts in Ramnad, but he moved to Chennai when he was around 18 years old to become a full-fledged musician. He was attracted to GNB’s style of singing and was a regular at his concerts. Subsequently, he happened to be exposed to Veena Dhanammal through his friend Mottu Krishnaswamy Iyengar (a direct disciple of Kanchipuram Naina Pillai).He was awestruck by the way she played the veenai. He wanted to expand his style of music and was then introduced to T Brindha and T Muktha, who were the foremost representatives of Dhanammal’s school of music. He started picking up their bani and they imparted their knowledge about the style to him.”Around this time, Krishnan was already becoming famous for his style of music. His rendering of ragas, notably Begada and Sahana, and ragas like Umabaranam andNayaki, among others, were unique. He was even called Sahana Krishnan by many. “Musician Jon B Higgins, who was learning under flautist T Viswanathan, was asked to learn from my father when he was doing his post-graduation in Carnatic music,” recollects Ramanathan, adding, “He had the best of everything. He was an A-grade artiste in All India Radio and performed to full houses. He even had the opportunity to move to the US for two years. But my father came back in three months, saying, ‘I was born to sing to people who understand our music’.”When he was around 35, he was regarded as one of the top musicians of Madras. “He was strong, but at the same time, he had a soft personality. I was amazed when he decided to come back from the USA, even though he knew he could have earned more money there. But he would get emotional for the smallest of things and had a child-like behaviour,” reminisces Ramanathan.Krishnan’s terrific sense of humour and punctuality are qualities that many from that generation remember even today. Ramananthan says, “He was quite adamant, too. He would never budge for audience’s likes when he was performing. He would never go for the ‘popular song’ as he believed that the audience must be exposed to the traditional and purest music. He was the torch-bearer of tradition. And for this reason, not just music connoisseurs, even many musicians used to attend his concert.","Ramnad Krishnan, a musician born on September 14, 1918, left a lasting impact on the world of Carnatic music.

lending institution, for the first-time banks are battling it out by developing innovative additions. hsbc, for instance, has designed a flexible interest rate package in which customers have the option to move from free to fixed in the beginning of the year. and idbi bank allows the brokerage fee to be added to the loan sanction amount. also, most of the players have waived administrative or processing fees during this festive season. many of them are also issuing personal loans to customers for the remaining 10 or 15 per cent, as they can provide normally 80 to 85 per cent for home loans. banks are also rolling out special housing loan branches to service customers. ''there is a chaos in the home loan mart. the consumers have a wide range of option but have to closely look at hidden costs before choosing the lender,'' warns ac varma, deputy gm at sbi. ''our offer still works out to be the best in the market. we have no hidden cost and disclose each and every rupee that we levy from the customer,'' he adds. the hidden cost in a home loan includes cost of phone calls made by the lender to the customer, costs for sending reminder notice, levying exorbitant fee when a cheque bounces or expenses of a representative visiting the customer. ''the customers are getting the best of the benefits. if all tax concessions are adjusted for, the net rate of interest on home loan will be in the region of just 7 to 8 per cent,'' said harsh roonta, ceo apnaloan.
","The recent interest rate reduction by HDFC and ICICI has ignited a fierce competition among home loan lenders in India, challenging the traditional dominance of HDFC, ICICI, and HUDCO in the sector. New entrants like Standard Chartered have aggressively entered the market, offering competitive fixed interest rates. For instance, Standard Chartered now provides a 12.3% interest rate for a 15-year loan period, competing favorably with State Bank of India.

Banks are striving to attract customers with innovative features, such as HSBC's flexible interest rate package, allowing customers to switch from floating to fixed rates. Many lenders have waived administrative fees and are offering personal loans to cover the remaining portion of home purchases.

However, consumers must be cautious about hidden costs associated with home loans, such as phone call charges, reminder notices, and bounced check fees. Despite the fierce competition and complexities, experts believe that, considering tax concessions, the net interest rate on home loans could potentially be as low as 7 to 8 percent.",National News,165,480

Unofficial reports however, received here put the death toll at 400.

According to information reaching here, the fire broke out around 2 pm at the Rajiv Marriage Palace which had been hired by the school management for the annual day function. A joyous function was turned into a tragedy.

Meanwhile Haryana Director General of Police Kalyan Rudra told PTI in Chandigarh that the cause of the devastating fire was a short circuit in the “kanat” of the shamiana where annual function of the DAV School Dabwali was being held.

The short circuiting on the roof of the tented structure led to the fire which quickly engulfed the nylon fabric of the tent This led to the collapse of the structure, Mr Rudra said adding some of the dead were electrocuted while others were asphyxiated.Meanwhile, an LPG cylinder exploded as the fire spread engulfing the area, he said.

Some eyewitnesses said the fire broke out due to an acrobatic fire show by students of the school.

Mr Rudra said he was leaving for Dabwali for an on the spot assessment of the situation.

Deputy Commissioner Sirsa M.P Bidlan said he had left the place a little before 2pm along with other officers of the district as well as the Sub Divisional Magistrate.

The place was packed to the capacity with more than 1,200 people, including students, their parents, members of the staff and other participants.

SDM of Sirsa Mr Somnath Kamboj who suffered 90 percent burn injuries was rushed to Hisar hospital. where he succumbed to his injuries, while his wife died in the mishap.Among the injured were the Deputy Superintendent of Police, his wife and daughter. They, along with 60 others seriously burnt cases, have been shifted to the PGI hospital here. According to PGl s senior doctors, emergency arrangements have been made to take care of the serious cases.

According to the local residents. the Rajiv Marriage Palace was over crowded with students and others. The tents rapidly caught fire and made the exit of the people nearly impossible. Unfortunately, there were no arrangements to fight the fire except the one municipal fire tender. He fire tenders, which were rushed from Abohar and Sirsa. could do little to mitigate the tragedy.

There were heart-rending scenes as a large number of burnt children and elders were crying for help. Relatives were rushing helter-skelter to locate their kith and kin.Reports from Dabwali also said that social and political organisations are rushing all help and taking the injured to the hospitals.

The venue of the annual day function was totally gutted within an hour and the rescue operations became very difficult. The stampede that followed the fire crushed many small children.

Among those seriously injured were DSP Anil Yadav, his family and freedom fighter Gurdev Singh Shant, local politician Keshav Singh and journalist Jai Muni Goel, police added.

Sources said that the death toll was likely to go up further as the retrieval operations were still in progress at the site.

Senior district officials have reached Dabwali and were supervising rescue and relief operations there.The local residents beelined at the hospital to donate blood for the injured, doctors said.

Two local philanthropists - Hanstaj Thutalia and Rahul Sethia have announced that they would bear full expenses for the treatment of the injured.

Meanwhile Union Minister of State for Education Selja rushed to Mandi Dabwali, which is her constituency.

It is indeed the worst tragedy that has struck Haryana. According to Additional Director General of Police H. Y Hari Shankar, who rushed to Dabwali along with police chief Kalyan Rudra. said “such a devastating fire has never broken out in the State it is too deep a tragedy for tears Small children have just been roasted alive.”

Information and Public Relations Secretary Anil Razdan said that Chief Minister Bhajan Lal expressed his heartfelt sympathy and rushed to Dabwali around 7pm. He said that initial reports were sketchy, but later the death toll was confirmed.","A fire broke out at the Rajiv Marriage Palace in Mandi Dabwali, district Sirsa, Haryana, causing 312 people, mostly school children, to be burnt alive.

Indian Express,1996-03-15 00:00:00,Justice J.S. Verma: A stickler for judicial discipline,"With his wife and grandchildren at his home: A limited social life
On a Sunday afternoon last fortnight, J.S. Verma was patience personified as he played with his grandchildren at his Janpath residence. As three-year-old Anirudh insisted that he had seen ""a ghost in the sky"", Verma lifted him onto his lap and began explaining to him in detail why there could be no ghosts. But the child was not convinced, so doting grandfather repeated the entire explanation with a great deal of patience.

As much a family man as a stickler for judicial discipline. Verma has a limited social life - of his own volition. He and his wife have two daughters, one settled in Delhi, the other in UK. Verma turns emotional while recalling his memories of his father. Nearly four decades ago, when he was practising in his hometown Satna in Madhya Pradesh, his father, a retired railway employee, wanted to file a suit and asked his son to represent him. But Verma not only declined to appear as his counsel, he refused to even draft the plaint, a decision that shocked and upset his father. Verma says he saw a potential conflict of interests.

Verma hasn't changed his stand. He still has strong views on judicial ethics; for him, it's not just an intellectual concept but almost an obsession. One that has drawn charges that the judge wears his principled nature on his sleeve.
Surprising for one who came into the legal field by default.

As a young man, Verma had set his heart on joining the armed forces. But discouraged by objections from his mother, he took up law on his father's suggestion. A student of Allahabad University, Verma joined the legal profession in 1955 and, in 1972, before he had turned 40, was appointed a judge in the Madhya Pradesh High Court. Later, he was to become the chief justice of the Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan high courts from 1985 to 1989 successively.

As a Supreme Court judge, Verma gained national prominence for the first time in 1991 when he was appointed as the head of the probe into the security lapses that led to Rajiv Gandhi's assassination. He completed the inquiry in just 15 months - without missing his regular court duties.

Verma is due to take over as the next chief justice of India in March 1997 and hold office for 10 months. Though he is currently the third-senior most judge in the Supreme Court, he is actually the longest serving, having lost out on seniority because of his elevation to the Supreme Court as late as June 1989, much after many of his juniors from other states.

Some lawyers say his several bold rulings against the Government and politicians could have delayed his promotion. Whatever the reason, the one-time lawyer from Satna seems to have come to the nation's apex court with a resolve to make up for lost time by setting for himself a blistering pace of work.","
J.S. Verma, a prominent figure in the Indian legal field, is known for his dedication to both his family and judicial principles. With a limited social life, he prioritizes spending time with his grandchildren and cherishes family moments. His commitment to ethical judicial conduct is unwavering, leading to accusations that he overtly displays his principled nature.

Verma's path to the legal profession was not his initial choice; he aspired to join the armed forces but ended up pursuing law due to his father's suggestion. He commenced his legal career in 1955 and quickly rose through the ranks. He served as a judge in the Madhya Pradesh High Court, becoming the chief justice of both the Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan high courts.

In 1991, Verma gained national recognition when he led the inquiry into the security lapses that led to the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. He completed this significant investigation within 15 months while fulfilling his regular court duties.

Despite being the longest-serving judge in the Supreme Court, Verma was not promoted to the highest position until 1997, potentially due to his bold rulings against the government and politicians. Nevertheless, he is determined to make up for lost time and set a rapid pace of work as he prepares to become the next Chief Justice of India.

This summary highlights J.S. Verma's commitment to his family, unwavering dedication to judicial ethics, and his remarkable career in the legal field.",Crime and Justice,241,498

Times Of India,1996-12-15 00:00:00,Top BMC official in dock,"MUMBAI: A writ petition was filed in Bombay high court on Tuesday against assistant municipal commissioner of H (west) ward Anil Khoje, holding him responsible for violation of development control regulations in the Bandra (W) ward office premises at Hill Road.

Civic activist Edwin Britto stated in his petition that the local ward office enclosed the compulsory open space in its premises.
As per the DC rules for reasons of safety, a minimum mandatory 20 feet space has to be left around public buildings on all sides.

""The work of constructing permanent structures totalling 1,500 sq mts was carried out in three phases, the last being in March 2005. The violation is not solely in the ward office premises but has been allowed all over Bandra (west).


Many restaurants have come up in the past five years on the compulsory open space in violation of the development control rules,""said Britto.

Even now, a 2000 sq mt structure is under construction in the compulsory open space between Union Bank and Mandar Nursing home at Turner Road in Bandra. ""The local ward office turns a blind eye to these constructions.

Many restaurants like Motimahal, Zaika, Stomach and Tawa have encroached on compulsory open spaces. Once the structure is built, the BMC issues them a showcause notice for which the other party gets a stay from the court and action remains suspended for ever,""added Britto.

While Khoje was unavailable for comment, deputy municipal commissioner Vijay Kalam Patil said: ""It is up to the local ward office to serve a notice under Section 354 of the BMC Act to initiate demolition action if the construction is found to be unauthorised.

the Hindu,1997-04-02 00:00:00,Explained | What is China’s One Country Two Systems policy?,"Protests in Hong Kong, now in its 13th consecutive week, have brought a decades-old policy of the People’s Republic of China back into focus — One Country Two Systems.

The protesters, who started occupying the city’s streets in April after the local government proposed a controversial extradition law, say Beijing is trying to violate this policy by infringing on Hong Kong’s autonomy. They want China to end its interference, while Beijing has likened the protesters to terrorists and have said that it won’t tolerate any challenge to its sovereignty over Hong Kong.

So, what’s this One Country Two Systems approach?

Origin of policy
To put it simply, it means that the Hong Kong and Macau Special Administrative Regions, both former colonies, can have different economic and political systems from that of mainland China, while being part of the People’s Republic of China.

The One Country Two Systems policy was originally proposed by Deng Xiaoping shortly after he took the reins of the country in the late 1970s. Deng’s plan was to unify China and Taiwan under the One Country Two Systems policy. He promised high autonomy to Taiwan. China’s nationalist government, which was defeated in a civil war by the communists in 1949, had been exiled to Taiwan. Under Deng’s plan, the island could follow its capitalist economic system, run a separate administration and keep its own army but under Chinese sovereignty. Taiwan, however, rejected the Communist Party’s offer.

The island has since been run as a separate entity from the mainland China, though Beijing never gave up its claim over Taiwan.

Return of colonial territories
The idea of two systems in one country resurfaced when Beijing started talks with Britain and Portugal, who were running Hong Kong and Macau, respectively.

The British had taken control of Hong Kong in 1842 after the First Opium War. In 1898, the British government and the Qing dynasty of China signed the Second Convention of Peking, which allowed the British to take control of the islands surrounding Hong Kong, known as New Territories, on lease for 99 years. London promised Peking that the islands would be retuned to China after the expiry of the lease, in 1997. Macau, on the other side, had been ruled by the Portuguese from 1557. They started withdrawing troops in the mid-1970s.

In the 1980s, Deng’s China initiated talks with both Britain and Portugal for the transfer of the two territories. In talks, Beijing promised to respect the region's autonomy under the One Country Two Systems proposal. On December 19, 1984, China and the U.K. signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration in Beijing, which set the terms for the autonomy and the legal, economic and governmental systems for Hong Kong post 1997.

Similarly, on March 26, 1987, China and Portugal signed the Joint Declaration on the Question of Macau in which China made similar promises for the region of Macau after it was handed over to Beijing.

Hong Kong returned to Chinese control on July 1, 1997, and Macau’s sovereignty was transferred on December 20, 1999. Both regions became Special Administrative Regions of China. The regions would have their own currencies, economic and legal systems, but defence and diplomacy would be decided by Beijing. Their mini-Constitutions would remain valid for 50 years — till 2047 for Hong Kong and 2049 for Macau. It is unclear what will happen after this term.

What triggered the current crisis?
In recent years, there has been a growing outcry from Hong Kong’s pro-democracy civil society against China’s alleged attempts to erode the city’s autonomy. This has created tensions between the city’s youth and the local government, which is effectively chosen by Beijing.

In 2016-17, six legislators critical of Beijing were debarred. In 2018, the Hong Kong National Party, a localist party that has been critical of Beijing, was outlawed. This year, Carrie Lam, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, proposed the extradition Bill, which sought to extradite Hong Kongers to places with which the city doesn’t have extradition agreements. Critics said it would allow the city government to extradite Beijing critics to mainland China where the judicial system is subservient to the ruling Communist Party.

This triggered the protests, and they went on despite Ms. Lam’s decision to suspend the Bill. The protesters, who often clashed with the police, now want the Bill to be formally withdrawn, Ms. Lam to resign, the arrested protesters to be released and the city’s electoral system to be reformed.","The ongoing protests in Hong Kong, now in their 13th week, center around the One Country Two Systems policy, which allows the city to maintain different economic and political systems from mainland China while being part of the People’s Republic of China. Initially proposed by Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s, the policy was implemented when Britain and Portugal transferred control of Hong Kong and Macau to China in 1997 and 1999, respectively. However, recent tensions have arisen due to Beijing's perceived encroachment on Hong Kong's autonomy, leading to protests against a proposed extradition law that would allow Hong Kongers to be extradited to mainland China.

Business Standard,1997-04-05 00:00:00,1995 And All That,"Restoring grants and scholarships and lowering tuition could be initiated with the stroke of a pen. Rescinding corporate welfare, cutting back on defence spending, and eliminating pork-barrel projects would be complex but legislatively attained.

Stopping the war meant unconditional surrender. It meant abandoning the doctrine that had become the world religion Theo-economy. Under this doctrine the economy is God, and finance its philosophy. Though the religious foundation of the doctrine was not usually acknowledged by the faithful, its true nature had been experienced and preached by its mystics and apostles. It was Calvin Coolidge who said : The man builds a factory builds a temple. And the man who works there worships there.... The business of America is business.

Theo-economy had taken root in the industrialised West. Its missionaries, as zealous as their earlier counterparts, had proselytised it universally.
By 1995, with the end of the Cold War, the entire world had embraced the faith. Political beliefs and foreign policy agendas that had once dictated national policies and initiated wars gave way to pure Theo-economic considerations.
Foreign relations:
Money talks, Policy walks
Everyones been saying for a long time foreign policy is becoming economic, but like everything its taken a while for the message to sink in around here, the former Treasury Secretary, Lloyd Bentsen, said just before he left town [Washington] last month, (NYT, 1/15/95)

After Treasury Secretary Bentsen left town, his replacement, Robert Rubin, drove the message home: The future prosperity and security of the United States requires that our nation remain engaged and lead globally in opening markets, in promoting development, in assisting economies in transition and in dealing with global financial problems.
Trades Bottom Line:
Business over Politics
For the first time in this century, the government has regularly put promotion of business interests at the top of its foreign policy agenda.
Everyone acknowledges that economics now plays a central role in foreign policy that battle is over, one of Mr Clintons top economic advisors said the other day. What no one has really grappled with is what happens when commercial interests push out other interests. (NYT,7/30/95).

Actually, what happens when commercial interests push out other interests had been grappled with in the past. Abraham Lincoln said: The money power preys upon the nation in times of peace and conspires against it in times of adversity. It is more despotic than monarchy. More insolent than autocracy, More selfish than bureaucracy. I see in the near future, a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country. Corporations have been enthroned. An era of corruption will follow and the money power of the country will endeavour to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the republic is destroyed.

The era of corruption took longer to establish than Lincoln envisaged. But he had accurately predicted the results of Theo-economic rule. Human rights, political liberties, social justice, and individual freedoms became closet issues. What Lincoln could not foresee was the Rain of Terror the Theo-economic holy war waged on the environment.
The millions massed in the streets at the millennium were calling for an end to the Envirowar. The march ended. The vigil was over. The message was clear.
Not many realised that peace-and a return to planetary health-meant abandoning the articles of the religious faith that had won the unshakable allegiance of virtually every government on Earth. This was not to be accomplished with a pen stroke, not even through top-to-bottom reengineering of government policy.

But people were changing their ideas. When ideas change, everything changes. The articles for a new faith had been drawn.
But it would take tumultuous and troubled decades before the embracing ideals of the new patriotism superseded and supplanted the Theo-economic priesthood and its metafinanciers.
Trendpost: The successful businesses of the Global Age will practise a compassionate capitalism. Money will be made by individuals and firms capable of producing and marketing products and services that satisfy a world with changed values. Products that address real physical, emotional, and artistic (quality-of-life) needs and do not destroy the earth in the process will be in demand.","The article discusses the need for a shift away from Theo-economic doctrine, which considers the economy as God and finance as its philosophy. It emphasizes the dominance of economic interests in foreign policy and the adverse consequences of putting commercial interests above other considerations. The author highlights historical warnings, such as Abraham Lincoln's prediction of corruption and the concentration of wealth leading to the destruction of the republic. The article suggests that a new faith, centered around compassionate capitalism and products that address genuine needs without harming the environment, should replace the prevailing Theo-economic ideology.",Business and Finance,95,702

Crucial to the decision was the marathon meeting which Pramod Mahajan, BJP’s national secretary, had with Thackeray. In that meeting, Mahajan reportedly impressed upon the Sena chief that in the wake of the dilemma the Janata Dal was in, owing to the Central Bureau of Investigation’s decision to seek prosecution of party president and Bihar Chief Minister Laloo Prasad Yadav, inaction in Sutar’s case would prove counter-productive to the alliance partners both at national and state level.","In a surprising move contrary to Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray's stance, Chief Minister Manohar Joshi forwarded Sashikant Sutar's resignation to Governor P C Alexander, following through on his pledge in the Assembly.

“Despite reminders, we have not received any communication from 18 out of the 39 recognised regional political parties, including the Shiv Sena,” Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) M S Gill said today.

Dr Gill told media persons that by and large, the response of the recognised national as well as regional parties was satisfactory. “All the seven national parties have submitted their organisational election progress to the Commission. However, regional parties were very slow,” he pointed out.
The CEC said the Commission has convened a meeting of all recognised political parties on May 7 to discuss the model code of conduct, the need to hike the limit on expenditure and other issues of interest. “The overall policy of the Commission is that no segment of the country should remain unrepresented either in the Parliament or the State Legislature. Therefore, we now make a point to conduct the by-elections immediately after the vacancy arises. Without waiting for the limit of six months prescribed under the Constitution, we are trying to hold the elections as early as possible,” he added.

Indian Express,1997-06-23 00:00:00,Shyamji Antala recharges 2.5 lakh wells in Saurashtra using cost-effective technique,"For the many farmers of Saurashtra - a huge, hot dustbowl - every summer brings a foretaste of apocalypse. The fear of drought gleams through the cracks of dry well beds as groundwater recedes further into elusive nooks and crannies of the earth.

Every evening, farmers listlessly trudge back home from their thirsty fields, their minds already clogged with the thoughts of misery and impending doom. But all this may be changing. Because of one man, hope is beginning to form on the margins. A man who has taken a vow to bring back water to all the wells of Saurashtra using the simple materials that he possesses - human ingenuity and a rustic pragmatic sense.

Shyamji Antala, 60, is seen almost like a messiah among Saurashtrian folk for he has helped recharge 2.5 lakh wells out of a huge seven lakh dry ones in the region. Says Chunibhai Katheriya, a Rajkot farmer: ""He is our Bhishmapitamah ... He will not rest till all the wells are full of water.""

Antala, a lean, gaunt man with a shock of white hair, often seen crisscrossing the area to examine long-abandoned wells, is less gushing: ""It all started off with a few wells near Dhoraji But now tackling the water crisis here has become a mission for me.""
All of Antala's success in well-recharging stems from his pragmatism. He works with what he has. Saurashtra suffers from the fact that there isn't a single perennial river. But what it has is countless erratic rivulets with rocky beds that keep coming alive every monsoon and die soon after.

For instance, recently in Nagarpipadia, Antala prescribed that all dry wells should be connected to the rivulet with the help of 9-inch-diameter cement pipes.

The pre-monsoon showers last month had almost all the wells brimming. In two days the water percolated down. Villagers estimate that with two good showers, the groundwater level will improve dramatically. Says Keshubhai Mepa Katheriya, another farmer: ""It will translate to about one acre of additional groundnut crop (a profit of Rs 6,000) for me.""

For different situations, Antala has varying methods. If there isn't a rivulet nearby, he improvises with other techniques. In Gundasara village, he proposed that villagers dig 6ft-by-6ft tanks with cemented beds near each dry well. Then by studying the lay of the land, he worked out areas where water naturally collects during the rains. These were connected to the tanks by loosely made canals.

And the upper portion of the tank in turn connected to the well by a pipe. Once the rains trigger off a flow of water, the tanks get filled up, the mud settles to the bottom and clean water trickles down to the depths of the well.

Each shower feeds the well to a point that water can easily be drawn out. Today, with this technique, 210 out of the 277 dry wells in this region are gurgling with water and Gundasara is making a yearly profit of Rs 18 lakh in additional groundnut crop.
Well-recharging isn't an intricate engineering feat. The cost is negligible and the theory environmentally correct. Yet, simply put, the returns are so dramatic that for most it is a modern-day miracle. For Saurashtra, the groundnut belt of Gujarat, Antala's methods are followed with the same reverence as Moses' commandments.

His status, going by people's reactions, is just a few notches below God. And even if the Gujarat Government hasn't yet put well-recharging as one of its development programmes, Antala's work has sparked off a mini-revolution in Saurashtra.

Across the border, Rajasthan, spurred by Antala's success, has started its own well-charging schemes. And though Gujarat itself hasn't emulated this, D.K. Pal, joint secretary of the Cooperative and Rural Development Department, admits: ""He has added a whole new dimension to rural development.""

Antala's obsession with wells and water began in 1988 when he saw farmers in his native town Dhoraji trying to recharge their dead wells. Till then Antala's life had been largely unremarkable, working as a circulation manager in a Gujarati daily. But the sight of these desperate farmers lingered in his mind.

The four-year-long drought (1984-88) in Saurashtra had already made him think about water conservation. He mulled over it for many days, discussed it animatedly with friends, and finally worked out ways to revive wells. Once confident about his methods, he and a close friend, Natwar Singh Chauhan, decided to launch the Saurashtra Lok Manch. Revolution, he felt, was at hand.

Not quite. Armed with literature and theories, for the next three years both of them scoured villages over the six districts of Saurashtra offering to gift them this ""new lease of life"". Absurdly, there were no takers. Philanthropy was long dead and everywhere people eyed them suspiciously.

Worse, most felt that the two of them had a personal interest in reviving wells, with some farmers even demanding money for the recharging. ""It reflected the greed that subsidies and populism had bred among the people,"" says Antala. ""We were totally frustrated,"" adds Chauhan.

But as is usual with Antala, he put his mind to it. And his native ingenuity came up with religion. Families of rural Gujarat have a tradition of religious gurus whom they consult on important occasions.

Besides, the state has a huge number of immensely popular spiritual leaders who roam the villages. Antala contacted a few of them - notably Madhavpriyadasji of the Swaminarayans and Swami Kishorchandraji of the Vaishnavas - to sell the idea of well-recharging.

All of them grasped the potential of his schemes and decided to spread his message through their brigades of saffron-clad ascetics. And the message was this: If the villagers didn't listen, Saurashtra ""would be a desert in 30 years"".

Within months the tables had turned. Not only had the sadhus converted the people, voluntary organisations and cooperative bodies would suddenly turn up at Antala's door wanting to be involved.

""I was overwhelmed. All of them are the real reason behind our success,"" says Antala. But most farmers disagree. They talk about a tireless zeal that has taken over Antala's life. Yes, he still works as circulation manager. But every free hour is spent trying to spread awareness on water conservation.

Today there are myths about his tremendous physical strength that trace their origin to the fact that he has had a hard life. As a young boy he was denied the joys of childhood, having instead to sell the family's ancestral land because of his father's debts. At varying stages of his life he has worked as farm labour, road labour and done the occasional stint as peon.
He struggled to climb the ladder, first becoming a sanitary inspector in Dhoraji and then a municipal councillor. Says his wife Vanitaben: ""But today his well-recharging scheme is like a second wife."" She and their two sons (both businessmen) dote on him. ""His work gives us pride.""

But Antala isn't satisfied. Maybe Saurashtra is on the healing curve and within a few years the bottoms of all the wells will gleam with water. But what of the other water-starved areas of the country? ""I feel like going all over and telling them that they should forget about the government and what it is not doing for them. Be self-reliant. Do it yourself. You can solve your own problems.""","In the arid region of Saurashtra, where drought is a recurring nightmare for farmers, a man named Shyamji Antala has become a beacon of hope. Antala, often seen as a messiah by the locals, has taken it upon himself to revive the region's dry wells using simple, cost-effective methods. His efforts have successfully recharged 2.5 lakh out of seven lakh dry wells, offering a lifeline to the parched land.

Antala's approach is practical and rooted in the local environment. He utilizes the occasional rivulets with rocky beds that come to life during the monsoon season. By connecting dry wells to these rivulets with cement pipes, he ensures that they fill up during the rains. In areas without nearby rivulets, he creates tanks with cemented beds and canals to collect rainwater, which then trickles down to replenish the wells.

This grassroots effort has led to a significant increase in agricultural yields, benefiting local farmers. Antala's work has not only improved the water situation in Saurashtra but also inspired similar initiatives in neighboring Rajasthan. His dedication and ingenuity have brought a sense of empowerment to the community and serve as a model for self-reliance in addressing water scarcity issues. Despite his success, Antala remains driven to spread his message of self-sufficiency and problem-solving to other water-starved regions across the country.",Environment,218,1220
Times of India,1997-06-27 00:00:00,The Role of Political Sophistication in Learning From News: Measuring Schema Development,"Accounting for learning from news has focused on media attention, media gratification, content-specific exposure, and prior knowledge. One measure of prior knowledge is political sophistication, measuring components of both knowledge and ideology. Two studies evaluated the reliability, concurrent validity, and comparative predictive validity of political sophistication in comparison to those of exposure, attention, and civics knowledge. Study 1 focused on the 1993-1994 health care reform debate. Those higher in political sophistication learned more from broadcast and print news, and had more differentiated constructs and higher quality arguments about health policy issues in open-ended essays. These findings were replicated in Study 2, which was conducted within a simulated mayoral election campaign. The results suggest that political sophisticates do not simply consume more news but process it differently than their less-sophisticated counterparts.","One key focus of the study is likely to be ""schema development."" Schemas are mental frameworks or structures that help individuals organize and make sense of information. In the context of news consumption, the study likely examines how people with varying degrees of political sophistication develop and use schemas to process and retain information from news sources.

The Hindu,1997-09-06 00:00:00,The Diana tragedy,"As Princess Diana's tragic death is mourned, investigators examine the circumstances of the Paris car crash, and questions are raised about the role and values of the tabloid press.AS the news raced round the world in the early hours of the Paris morning, it was received with profound shock and grief. Diana, the 36-year-old Princess of Wales and divorced wife of the heir to the British throne, was grievously injured in a car crash in a Paris expressway tunnel near the Eiffel Tower a little after midnight on August 30-31, and died in a hospital three hours later.

Diana's friend and companion, the Egyptian-born millionaire Emad Mohamed ""Dodi"" Fayed, 41, and the driver of the car died on the spot; the fourth person in the car, a bodyguard identified as Trevor Rees-Jones, who was in the front passenger seat, was seriously injured. The car had apparently rammed into the wall of the tunnel while speeding away from photographers who were pursuing it on motorcycles.

The police soon discovered that a combination of factors had contributed to the fatal denouement. The driver, identified as Henri Paul, was, it turned out, not a professional chauffeur, but a security officer at the Ritz hotel, where Diana and Fayed had dined that night. (The hotel is owned by Fayed's father Mohammed Al Fayed, who also owns the Harrods department store in London.) Dodi Fayed's regular driver had left the hotel earlier in another vehicle as a decoy to throw photographers off the trail of the couple. The car in which Diana and Fayed were riding from the hotel to Fayed's villa - a black Mercedes-Benz sedan - was an armoured vehicle; owing to their additinal weight, such vehicles are somewhat more difficult to manoeuvre, according to the car manufacturer.

Paul was driving at an estimated 192 kmph in a 48-kmph zone, with the papparazzi giving chase. And, crucially, he was drunk at the wheel: the level of alcohol in his bloodstream at the time of the accident was 1.70 grams per litre of blood - more than three times the legally permitted limit; according to medical experts, such a level of alcohol could cause staggering and double vision and vastly increase the possibility of accidents.

A statement released by the Paris prosecutor's office said that the blood test of the driver was ordered to ""know in what way (the driver) may have been hindered or influenced while driving, not only by the vehicles pursuing but also by any other circumstances."" Paul evidently lost control of the vehocle, which struck one of the concrete pillars in the tunnel's central dividing line and hurtled into the concrete wall on the right. The tunnel, about 300 metres long, brick-lined and well-illuminated, is one of many that dot the main highway that follows the Seine river.

The car was reduced to a compressed mass of twisted metal and broken glass. A Mercedes-Benz official said that no car could have withstood such a devastating collision. ""No vehicle in the world is built to withstand the dimensions of this accident,"" the official said. Prosecutors said that under the impact of the collision, the speedometer indicator had been jammed at 121 mph (192 kmph).

DIANA, who was seated in the back seat with Fayed, suffered chest and head injuries; she was extricated from the wreckage and taken to the Pitie Salpetriere hospital. Surgeons found massive internal bleeding from her heart arteries, but were unable to restore blood circulation, and pronounced her dead.

Dr. Bruno Riou, who headed the team of surgeons that treated her, said that emergency workers had immediately begun treatment on Diana at the crash site and had been able to revive her. ""On her arrival at the Salpetriere hospital,'' he said, ""she appeared to be in serious haemorrhagic shock, originating in her thorax, and soon aftrwards she had a cardiac arrest. Her chest cavity was urgently opened up, revealing a significant wound to her left ventricle. Despite a closure of the wound and an external and internal cardiac massage lasting two hours, no effective circulation could be re-established, and death was noted at 4 a.m.""

According to witnesses, when Diana and Fayed left the Ritz hotel, seven photographers, who had been waiting at the hotel, took off in pursuit on two-wheelers. Witnesses at the accident site said they heard a long screech and a crash and saw photographers arrive on the scene. News agencies quoted witnesses as saying that some five photographers were taking close-up pictures of Diana trapped in the car minutes after the accident and that one of the photographers was beaten up by horrified witnesses.

French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said the police were questioning seven photographers (six of them French and one Macedonian) as part of a criminal investigation into the accident and had seized 20 rolls of film. The police also impounded two motorcycles and a scooter. The statement released by the prosecutor's office said that the police also carried out searches at the headquarters of several news agencies ""to seize any photographs of the chase and of the accident... which could be used as evidence.""

A lawyer for the Fayed family said he would file a suit for civil damages for invasion of privacy and hazardous action by the photographers. He claimed that a motorcycle had been seen zigzagging in front of Diana's car seconds before it crashed.

The prosecutor's office also said, in an apparent reference to the photographers, that an investigation showed that some people appeared not to have given assistance to the crash victims. France has a ""Good Samaritan"" law that makes it a crime not to help someone in danger. The prosecutor said he was planning to order a judicial probe into the accident but that charges would not be decided until the end of the probe. The prosecutor said the questioning of Rees-Jones, the sole survivor of the mishap, would be ""very important"".

DIANA'S death came as she was establishing a new public role for herself following her acrimonious separation and divorce from Prince Charles and her public rift with the royal family. She had also recently raised her political profile with a campaign for a worldwide ban on landmines.

The news of her death stunned the world, and, in Britain, grief soon turned into public mourning. A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said the Queen and Prince Philip were ""deeply shocked and distressed"". President Bill Clinton said he was ""profoundly saddened"".

British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who was in the Philippines, issued a statement from Manila that said that ""if it is proven that the press had a role in causing the accident, we need to give serious thought to these aggressive tendencies on the part of the media.""

Diana's brother, Earl Spencer, expressed his family's grief and anger in a statement he issued from his Cape Town, South Africa, residence. ""I always believed the press would kill her,"" he said. But, he said, he never imagined the press would have ""a direct hand in her death, as seems to be the case."" Every editor and proprietor who had commissioned intrusive photographs of Diana had ""blood on his hands"", Spencer said.

THE royal family was staying at its estate in Balmoral, Scotland, when news of Diana's death came. Prince Charles woke up his two sons, William, 15, the second in line to the throne, and Harry, 12, and broke the news. Later that day they attended church services with their father, the Queen and the Queen Mother.

On the evening of August 31, Charles, accompanied by Diana's sisters Lady Jane Fellowes and Lady Sarah McCorquo-dale, brought home from Paris Diana's simple wooden coffin wrapped in the royal standard. The coffin was taken from the plane by an Air Force honour guard and carried to a hearse, which headed for a private mortuary. The next day, Diana's body was moved to the Chapel Royal at St. James' Palace, the official home of Prince Charles, in central London.

Two thousand people jammed St. Paul's Cathedral for a memorial service at the site of the July 29, 1981, marriage that began Diana's legendary transformation.

Buckingham Palace announced that Diana's funeral service would take place on September 6 at Westminster Abbey. She will be buried at the Spencer family home at Althorp in Northants. A Downing Street spokesman said the funeral would be a state event but without the pomp and ceremony of a full state funeral. ""It will be a public event involving the causes close to her heart to reflect her image as the people's princess,"" the spokesman said.

Fayed's body was brought to London and taken to the Regent's Park Mosque, where a 25-minute ceremony was held. A police motorcyclist and two police cars escorted the hearse carrying his black-draped coffin. About 50 mourners waited outside the mosque. Fayed was later buried at Brookwood cemetery, southwest of London.

IN Britain, the tragedy appeared to have caused a backlash against the ""aggressive intrusion"" of the private lives of celebrities by the tabloid press. When photographers appeared at Kensington Palace and outside Buckingham Palace on the night of August 31, some people shouted accusations at them, a sign of revulsion at the tactics of the paparazzi who had dogged her.

THE paparazzi began as an Italian phenomenon, pesty shutterbugs flitting through the streets of Rome on Vespa motor scooters endangering life and limb - their own and everyone else's. They were introduced to the rest of the world in Federico Fellini's classic l959 Italian film La Dolce Vita.

From Rome they spread out as celebrities caught the imagination of the world's press. Soon they became a bigger scourge to Hollywood and royal celebrities.

Lately, however, the paparazzi wars have escalated as the demand and financial rewards for intimate pictures of the rich and famous have grown beyond the bounds of decency. The camera-toting freelancers can - and do - earn as much as $1 million for the right set of photographs of celebrities. The ""stalkerazzi"", as they are sometimes called, practise their profitable pursuits with the kind of stealth and planning of a clandestine spy operation. The latest wrinkle on the paparazzi scene is the ""video-razzi"" - men who shoot video footage, sometimes from vans with blacked-out windows. They often try to provoke and taunt celebrities so they can get more aggressive reactions on film.

WHILE all of Britain's newspapers bore the brunt of the public's outrage, it was a particular practice of the tabloids - buying unauthorised photographs from the paparazzi - that came under the most intense scrutiny.

For some time, public officials and editors of some of Britain's so-called quality newspapers, or broadsheets, have been calling for a privacy law that would forbid the news media from intruding too aggressively into people's private lives. But France, where the accident took place, has one of the strictest privacy laws in Europe.

Even if Britain were to enact such a law, it would not prevent the sort of chase that probably led to Diana's death, said Alan Rusbridger, Editor of The Guardian, who feels that the tabloids often go too far in invading people's privacy.

""I'm not sure that any privacy law would have operated here because it was in a public place and she was a public figure,"" Rusbridger said in an interview. ""But you would hope that simple editorial judgment would be used about whether or not this was a private event - and a woman going out with a boyfriend for dinner is not by any conceivable stretch of the imagination a public occasion.""

But, as Andrew Marr, Editor of The Independent - another broadsheet - pointed out, photographers lucky enough to snap an exclusive photograph of a celebrity in a private moment - embracing a new lover, eating dinner with someone other than their spouse, sunbathing in the nude - can expect a lucrative reward from an insatiable global marketplace.

Such photographers dogged Diana throughout her adult life, waiting by her car, following her down the street, taking wide-angle shots from secluded spots. They sold the pictures to the highest bidder.

""What happened in France happened not purely because the British tabloid newspapers spend a lot of money on their pictures,"" Marr said in an interview. ""So do international magazines and newspapers around the world. A member of the paparazzi who's on form and gets the right shot is said to be able to make 3 to 4 million a year.""

In fact, the photographer who took the first pictures of Diana and Dodi Fayed together several weeks ago reportedly sold them for well over $1 million around the world. And on August 31, several tabloid editors in Britain and the United States said that they had been offered pictures of the car just after the crash, with the mangled victims inside.

In Britain, the situation is compounded by the fierce circulation war among the tabloids, whose editors, cowed by the newspapers' aggressively unforgiving owners, go to extremes to produce exclusive stories and photographs. ""The tabloid editors are under intense and constant pressure to deliver, and they all knew that Diana would sell papers,"" Marr said.

In the outpouring of anti-media anger that swept the nation, it was easy to forget that the news media's relationship with Diana was at times symbiotic rather than parasitic. Diana thrived on news coverage and sometimes courted reporters. She met regularly with her favourites, like Richard Kay from The Daily Mail, to give her side of the story of the day - often, statements attributed to ""friends of Princess Diana"" came directly from Diana herself.

She also knew the value of, for example, appearing in an alluring dress at a high-profile event when Prince Charles was appearing somewhere else.

""It's terrible that this happened,"" James Whitaker, who covered royalty for The Daily Mirror, told the BBC. ""But there was an element of use of the paparazzi and photographers in general that Diana used enormously to her advantage. She knew exactly how to do it.""

DIANA participated enthusiastically in a number of humanitarian causes - working for AIDS and cancer victims, helping children and the aged, and more recently, the campaign to ban anti-personnel landmines. She visited the sick in hospices. She would often slip out at night, dressed in jeans and a baseball cap, to do her rounds of hospitals.

At the same time, she was also one of the most glamorous women in the world. Designers vied with one another to get her to wear their creations, she was constantly in the fashion pages of magazines, and she was also very much part of the international jet set, flitting from holiday to holiday. It was perhaps this mixture of compassion and glamour, her star quality and her evident humanity which saved Diana from being just another attractive, rich woman, and transformed her into an international figure whose death has been mourned the world over.

At a meeting with presspersons on August 31, Prime Minister Tony Blair described Princess Diana in a phrase that, for many, will probably come to define her. ""She was the people's princess,"" he said, ""and that's how she will stay, how she will remain, in our hearts and in our memories forever.""","Princess Diana's tragic death in a Paris car crash, mourned globally, has led to investigations into the circumstances and raised questions about the tabloid press. Diana, 36, died along with companion Dodi Fayed and driver Henri Paul in a high-speed chase with paparazzi. Paul, a security officer, was not a professional chauffeur and was intoxicated. The armored car, difficult to maneuver, crashed into a tunnel wall at 192 kmph. Diana suffered fatal injuries despite efforts to revive her. Investigations into the crash prompted the questioning of photographers, leading to potential legal action.

The incident sparked a backlash against tabloid intrusion, especially the purchase of unauthorized paparazzi photos. While mourning Diana's death, public anger targeted the press, with concerns about privacy invasion and aggressive media tactics. The paparazzi's role and the lucrative market for celebrity photos, reaching up to $1 million, came under scrutiny. Despite calls for privacy laws, their effectiveness was questioned, and France's strict privacy laws were noted. Diana's death marked the tragic end of her evolving public role post-divorce, with tributes emphasizing her compassion, glamour, and international impact. Prime Minister Tony Blair coined her as the ""people's princess,"" leaving an indelible mark on hearts and memories worldwide.

The Hindu,1997-09-06 00:00:00,Celebrating Independence with mixed feelings,"IT was one day when 120 million Pakistanis decided to put aside their woes and greeted the dawn with jubilation and gaiety. It was August 14, the day the country attained Independence 50 years ago. The golden jubilee celebrations started with special prayers in mosques all over the country.Almost a week before Independence Day, it was impossible to find an area in Karachi that was not done up with fluttering green-and-white Pakistani flags. The sale of national flags, badges and stickers became a multi-crore-rupee operation, which received a last-minute boost with every school asking parents to send their children on August 14 with a national flag.

With all prominent buildings lit up on the eve of the golden jubilee, old Karachi in particular presented a spectacular sight. As Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's programme to address the nation at the stroke of midnight was widely publicised by the print and electronic media, midnight revellers in several densely populated mohallas kept awake to listen to it and ushered in the dawn of the 50th year of their Independence with lighted oil lamps.

Clubs, educational and other institutions celebrated the occasion with pomp and pageantry. Special supplements of newspapers recalled the trauma of Partition and took an honest look at what the nation had achieved, or failed to achieve, in 50 years.

Undoubtedly, the spirit was one of jubilation. In the psyche of the Pakistani, completion of 50 years of Independence was a double victory; one, azadi from the British and two, freedom from the hold of a Hindu majority, which the Muslims of Pakistan believe would not have given a fair deal to the community in the matter of education, well-paying jobs and an opportunity to lead a life of dignity and comfort.

School kids sang with fervour, national and patriotic songs like ""Jeeve, jeeve Pakistan"" (Long Live Pakistan - a song composed during the Bangladesh war to stir up patriotism among Pakistanis) and ""Hamara parcham, hai jaan se bhi yeh pyara parcham"" (Our flag is more dear to us than our lives). And elders watching the broadcast of such programmes chimed in with fervour.

BUT beneath the enthusiasm and jubilation, an uneasy nation greeted, with a lot of trepidation, the hastily enacted law against terrorism at a special session of the National Assembly on the eve of the Independence Day. This law gives sweeping powers to the police and other law-enforcement agencies to shoot at sight, make arrests without warrants and search anybody's residence at the drop of a hat.","In anticipation of Independence Day, Karachi was adorned with green-and-white flags, and the sale of patriotic items surged.

The Hindu,1997-09-20 00:00:00,The battle rages on,"The Northern Alliance forces led by Ahmad Shah Masood are now close to Kabul; their plan is to encircle it and dictate terms to the retreating Taliban.
Kutchi nomads begin their annual migration from the dry plains near Kabul to the lush valleys in eastern Afghanistan. This year, their traditional route was blocked just north of Kabul owing to fighting between the Taliban and Opposition forces, and they were forced to spend the summer in the desert.
THE battle for Kabul has been raging over the last two months. The Taliban forces are in disarray after the Northern Alliance forces, led by Ahmad Shah Masood, routed them in Mazhar-e-Sharif in May this year and forced them to retreat to Kabul. The Taliban's retreat was one of the fastest in modern Afghan history. Within a matter of days, its forces were back in Kabul, 400 km from Mazhar-e-Sharif. In the process, they lost some of their best fighters and a lot of military equipment. Although the Taliban has managed to hold on to Kabul despite the latest setbacks, knowledgeable sources from the region say that it is becoming increasingly desperate. The forces led by Masood are only 20 km away from Kabul, but according to sources close to the Northern Alliance, the Tajik general will not launch a frontal attack on the capital at this juncture. Masood's game plan seems to be to encircle Kabul and dictate terms to the enemy. The final push for Kabul is expected to take place just before winter sets in.

The Taliban, in an effort to strengthen its decimated army, has recruited teenagers from Pakistan's religious seminaries. According to highly-placed sources in the capitals of Central Asia, Pakistani fighters have a strong presence in the Afghan capital. Hundreds of Pakistani fighters were captured by the Northern Alliance forces along with Pakistan Air Force transport planes at Mazhar-e-Sharif in May.

The Hindu,1997-09-20 00:00:00,A life of selfless caring,"Her philosophy on some issues met with criticism, but for her work of charity she will be remembered as Mother Teresa of the Poor.
MOTHER TERESA will be remembered for many things, but the most enduring memory of her will be that of a person who translated ideas into action quickly - a doer unwavering in her purpose, an unstoppable person. Government bureaucracy and red tape, the criticism of her detractors, the hardship of the street, her close encounters with human misery and her own declining health in the last years of her life - before none of these did she accept defeat. Mother Teresa got on with her job: that of serving the poorest of the poor.This trait of Mother Teresa’s manifested itself from the day she took the decision to give up the life of a nun and teacher in St. Mary’s School, a part of the Loreto Convent in the Calcutta suburb of Entally, and step into the streets. She made up her mind while on a train to Darjeeling in September 1946. “The message was quite clear, it was an order,” Mother Teresa later told her biographer, Navin Chawla. “He wanted me to be poor and to love Him in the distressing disguise of the poorest of the poor.”

What factors underlay the decision of a 36-year-old nun, a teacher for 17 years, remembered for her ordinariness and simplicity (and a sense of fun: “She would hold her waist with both hands and bend double with laughter,” recalled a colleague) to leave the protection of the convent and serve the poorest? What Mother Teresa described as an “inner command” or a “Call within a Call” was a profoundly religious and personal experience for her.

Did developments outside the four walls of the convent influence her in taking this decision? The early 1940s were tumultuous years. Following the outbreak of the Second World War came the Great Bengal Famine, in which millions died of starvation. Calcutta was inundated with thousands of starving people and resources were scarce. Then came the communal riots and massacres that accompanied Partition, which was followed by an influx of refugees from East Pakistan, now Bangladesh. Calcutta was bursting at its seams - slums and shantytowns mushroomed. Mother Teresa lived through these cataclysmic times and could not have remained unaffected by what was happening around her.

It was in July 1948 that Mother Teresa formally received the Vatican decree granting the Indent of Exclaustration, which meant that she would remain a nun but be allowed to work outside the convent. Her first question on hearing the news from her spiritual director, Father van Exem, was: “Excuse me, Father, can I go to the slums now?” She wore the white sari with blue band that would become the uniform of her Congregation for the first time in August 1948. It is from this point that the saga of Mother Teresa began.

MOTHER TERESA had come a long way from being a young aspirant to novicehood who left her native town of Skopje in 1928. (Skopje, which was in the kingdom of Albania, eventually became part of Yugoslavia. After the break-up of Yugoslavia, Skopje became part of Macedonia.) Born Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu on August 26, 1910, the youngest of three children, Mother Teresa’s early life was influenced most by her mother, a deeply religious person who took on the role of breadwinner of the family after the death of her husband when Agnes was just seven. By the age of 18, Agnes knew that she wanted to be a nun of the Loreto order, members of which she learnt were working in Bengal. She reached Calcutta in January 1929 after a short stay in Ireland. She spent the next 17 years as a teacher.

After four months of training with the Medical Mission Sisters in Patna in 1948, Mother Teresa returned to Calcutta. She began by starting a ‘school’ in Motijhil, one that did not have a roof, furniture, books and pencils! And of course she had no money. But she plunged into work and had several things going at the same time - another school in Tijala, by which time she was able to raise enough money to rent rooms for the Motijhil school. In the first fortnight of her work she had started a school and a dispensary, and had acquired a band of helpers along the way.

Between February 1949 and February 1953, Mother Teresa lived in 14 Creek Lane on the upper floor of the house of Michael Gomes. Here she was joined by her student Subashini Das, the future Sister Agnes. Another student, Magdalena Gomes, also joined Mother Teresa and took the name of Sister Gertrude. Over the next two years the number of Sisters swelled to 30. In October 1950, the congregation of the Missionaries of Charity was canonically erected and its constitution written. Unique to the congregation was the fourth vow of “Wholehearted and Free service to the poorest of the poor.” It was also in 1950 that she took up Indian citizenship.","

The Hindu,1997-10-04 00:00:00,Dealing with Pakistan,"THE ""Gujral doctrine"", as articulated by the External Affairs Minister - who is now also Prime Minister - has five component parts:
With its much smaller neighbours - Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives and Nepal - India ""does not ask for reciprocity, but gives all that it can in good faith and trust."" No South Asian country ""will allow its territory to be used against the interests of another country in the region."" No South Asian country ""will interfere in the internal affairs of another."" All South Asian countries ""must respect each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty."" All South Asian countries ""will settle their disputes through peaceful bilateral negotiations.""
While the last four propositions are intended by the Indian Prime Minister to apply to Pakistan as much as to any other country in the region, it is not clear how the Nawaz Sharif Government perceives the implications of the doctrine for the problematical Indo-Pakistan relationship.
However, the Pakistan Prime Minister's extended polemical attack in his address to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on ""Indian occupation"" of Jammu and Kashmir, characterised as ""the core issue"" in the bilateral relationship, and his insistence on involving the United Nations, ""the international community"" and, by implication, the United States in finding ""a just solution of the Kashmir dispute"" are a far cry from the meaning of the fourth and fifth elements in the ""Gujral doctrine"". That the Pakistani attack on India in the world body apparently contains somewhat less vitriol and fewer references to the ""rape"" of Kashmir and so forth is small consolation when set against the major challenge of normalising Indo-Pakistan relations. In fact, Nawaz Sharif's hostile and propagandistic references to India in his latest UNGA speech appear to go against the agreement recorded in the June 23, 1997 Joint Statement that ""both sides would take all possible steps to prevent hostile propaganda.""
The ""Male spirit"" has gradually waned since the two Prime Ministers appeared to begin a new chapter when they met in the Maldives in May 1997. The bilateral dialogue and the attempts to strike a warmer tone and forge a more ""friendly and harmonious"" relationship between the two countries have inevitably come up against the hard rock of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute. Nawaz Sharif, who started this Prime Ministerial term on a helpful and constructive note, seems to have his own political compulsions which limit his options with India.","The ""Gujral doctrine"" outlines five principles for India's foreign policy with its South Asian neighbors:

India will not demand reciprocity but will give freely and with trust to its smaller neighbors.

No South Asian country will allow its territory to be used against another country in the region.

No South Asian country will interfere in the internal affairs of another.

All South Asian countries will respect each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty.

All South Asian countries will settle their disputes through peaceful bilateral negotiations.

While the Pakistani Prime Minister has acknowledged the importance of these principles, his recent statements at the UNGA regarding the Kashmir dispute seem to contradict the spirit of the doctrine. His hostile rhetoric and calls for international involvement undermine the efforts to normalize Indo-Pakistan relations. The ""Male spirit"" of cooperation that emerged from the two Prime Ministers' meeting in the Maldives appears to be fading, and the bilateral relationship remains strained by the unresolved Kashmir issue.",National News,160,403

Even as we go into space, we keep our feet on the ground. - Dr. K. Kasturirangan, Chairman, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).
DESPITE the minor snag in the launch of the 1,200-kg Indian Remote-sensing Satellite (IRS-1D) with the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV-C1) from Sriharikota on September 29, ISRO scientists are confident that the mission's objectives will be achieved. A minor leak of helium gas from one of the components in the fourth stage of the vehicle led to ""a little less than the required velocity"" being imparted to the satellite which consequently went into a lower orbit. ISRO scientists began quickly to deal with the problem and their efforts to raise the perigee of the spacecraft have begun to take effect.

With the completion of this launch, ISRO is planning to fly higher into space. In about a year, the colossal Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV), about 51 metres tall and weighing 402 tonnes, will lift off from Sriharikota to deploy a 2,500-kg communication satellite into orbit. The GSLV will use cryogenic propellants in its third upper stage. (Liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen are cryogenic propellants). According to Dr. S. Vasantha, SHAR Director, facilities for storing cryogenic fluids have been built at SHAR and 10 to 15 km of pipelines have been laid to ferry the fluids to the GSLV on its launch pad. The Mobile Service Tower (MST), where the PSLV was integrated vertically, has also been modified to assemble the GSLV.

According to Dr. K. Kasturirangan, there were plans to build a second launching pad, costing Rs. 300 crores, at SHAR to accommodate the more advanced versions of the GSLV. While the initial flights of the GSLV will be powered by a Russian cryogenic engine, subsequent flights will use indigenous cryogenic motors. The first test of the indigenous engine is to take place next year.

The September 29 launch represented total technological self-reliance. This was the first time that an Indian-made launch vehicle launched an operational remote-sensing satellite, also made in India, from Indian soil. The two PSLVs that lifted off from SHAR in October 1994 and March 1996 were developmental flights that launched experimental IRS-P2 and P3 satellites. The IRS-1A, 1B and 1C, built at the ISRO Satellite Centre, Bangalore, were put into orbit by Russian vehicles from the Baikonur cosmodrome. As PSLV-C1 Mission Director S. Ramakrishnan put it, ""With this launch, we do not have to depend any more on foreign agencies."" He said: ""We have our own satellite and we have our own launch vehicles.""

While the PSLV put into orbit a 922-kg spacecraft in 1996, the latest satellite weighed 1,200 kg. This was achieved by making improvements in the various stages of the vehicle. Dr. Kasturirangan said, ""This is a unique intermediate capability vehicle, unlike Ariane 4 and 5, which are at the higher end of the mass capability."" According to him, not many vehicles exist of the intermediate class.

The massive four-stage PSLV-C1, standing 44 metres tall and weighing 294 tonnes, lifted off from the launch pad facing the beach and raced into the sky. The first stage along with four strap-on motors ignited and the remaining two strap-ons burst with life about 25 seconds later. The strap-ons and the first stage separated and fell into the sea. The second stage ignited. The heat-shield, which protects the satellite during the vehicle's ascent through hostile atmosphere, split down its seams and fell away at an altitude of 128 km. The second stage separation and third stage ignition took place simultaneously at 282 seconds after the lift-off. The third stage jettisoned at 501 seconds. Then there was a long coasting phase during which the fourth stage travelled on its own before erupting with life at 602 seconds. The fourth stage fell away at 1,037 seconds and the IRS-1D was injected into orbit.

Prime Minister I.K. Gujral, who watched the launch from the Mission Control Centre, warmly hugged Dr. Kasturirangan and later told presspersons: ""It was a great moment for the country."" ""We have broken new barriers in science and technology,"" he said and added, ""We have done it ourselves in both constructing a rocket and launching a satellite."" He congratulated ISRO's scientists on doing ""the country proud"". He said the success was a manifestation of their team effort. ""We have turned every challenge into an opportunity,"" he said. ""Ultimately, what is extremely important in science and technology is self-reliance."" Dr. Kasturirangan described the satellite as ""one of the best civilian remote-sensing satellites in the world.""

R. Aravamudhan, Director, ISRO Satellite Centre, Bangalore, told Frontline that he was ""thrilled"". According to him, the ignition, performance and separation of the stages ""were wonderful"". Describing the launch as a ""farewell gift"" (he is retiring after 37 years in ISRO), he said that he was involved in the building of rockets at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC); was Director of SHAR from where the satellites are launched; and is now where the satellites are built. ""So all our efforts have fructified.""

While the satellite should have reached a circular orbit at a height of 817 km, a leak of helium gas from one of the components in the fourth stage made it an elliptical orbit with an apogee of 817 km and a perigee of 300 km. The fourth stage should inject the satellite into orbit at a velocity of 7.46 km per second - 26,856 km an hour. But the velocity achieved was 7.33 km per second. The shortfall of 130 metres per second made all the difference and the satellite was injected into a lower orbit.

An ISRO scientist explained, ""When we fire the fourth stage engine, we have to apply pressure and expel the liquid fuel at a given rate through a swivelling nozzle. To do this, we use helium stored in bottles. The pressure with which the liquid was expelled was not enough. It was burning all right but it produced a lower thrust. So it could not produce enough velocity and the satellite went into lower orbit.""

The satellite has on board 85 kg of hydrazine fuel in small rockets called thrusters. The thrusters are fired for orienting the spacecraft properly. The 85 kg of hydrazine is more than is actually needed to take care of the ""dispersion"" during the injection of the satellite into orbit. Because of the extra fuel, earlier IRS have exceeded their lifespan. Although the projected life-span of each of Indian remote-sensing satellite is three years, the satellites have lasted six to seven years because of the extra fuel they carry on board. The IRS-1A, launched in March 1988, served for more than eight years. The IRS-1B, deployed in August, 1991, is still going strong. The IRS-1C, launched in December 1995, the IRS-P2 and the IRS-P3, are in fine fettle. According to ISRO scientists, the IRS-1D may not last for as long as the most successful of its predecessors did, because the hydrazine fuel is being used up in order to raise the perigee. They are, however, confident that the satellite will last for three years.

ISRO scientists fired the hydrazine thrusters and raised IRS-1D's perigee to 500 km. One of the scientists said, ""We have to raise the perigee to 550 km to get into a polar sun synchronous orbit."" (Later they achieved this and the satellite started beaming pictures.) He said that the satellite would live for two and a half to three years. ""It will be in an elliptical orbit, but it will meet the mission objectives.""

What are the mission's objectives? The imagery beamed down by the IRS constellation has been used to keep a watch on the destruction of forests, prospect for minerals, discover deposits of oil and gas, forecast yields of crops, identify potential fishing grounds in the sea, predict crops blights, locate groundwater and so on. The imagery has been used to map different categories of wasteland and assess wasteland that can be reclaimed. All this is done with the help of cameras on board the satellite. The IRS-1D, which is a clone of the IRS-1C, has three cameras.

Locating groundwater was among the early successful applications of the IRS series. The success rate of finding water by means of IRS was 95 per cent compared to the 45 per cent success rate achieved through conventional methods. Remote-sensing imagery has also been used to study coconut wilt disease in Kerala and the health of orange plantations near Nagpur, to re-align a ring road to Bangalore and to detect illegal ganja plantations in Madhya Pradesh.

The PSLV-C1 was able to launch a 1,200-kg satellite into orbit because of the improvements in various stages of the vehicle. The first booster stage had 139 tonnes of solid propellants while the 1996 flight had 128 tonnes of propellants. The second stage had 40 tonnes of liquid propellants compared to 37.5 tonnes in the previous vehicle. This time, four strap-on motors lit up on the ground and two in the air, the reverse of the earlier sequence of two on the ground and four in the air. This gave an additional 60 kg payload capability to the satellite. Besides, according to G.K. Mani, Manager, Liquid Stages Integration, the helium gas in the fourth stage was stored in bottles made of lighter kevlar fibre and not of titanium as in previous missions. This reduced the weight by 24 kg, which translated into 24 kg of extra payload for the satellite. There were also improvements in the avionics bay that forms the ""brain"" of the vehicle.

The success of the PSLV-C1 flight has opened up large commercial opportunities for ISRO. According to Dr. Kasturirangan, ""With two or three more launches in the coming years, we should be able to establish good credentials with respect to international customers."" ISRO has already signed a commercial agreement to fly a South Korean 100-kg remote-sensing satellite piggyback on the IRS-P4 satellite in July next year. There have also been inquiries for satellite construction from some countries.

Various countries have expressed an interest in receiving data from the IRS. ISRO had signed an agreement with SSI-EOSAT (Space Systems Imaging-Earth Observation Satellite Corporation of the U.S.) for sharing data from the IRS constellation. Other potential customers include Japan, Australia and South Africa. ISRO has forged a strategic partnership with Hughes Space Communication to supply some components for satellite systems. ISRO also provides tracking and telemetry support and inertial orbit checkout of satellites on a commercial basis for some companies.

ISRO is planning an ambitious series in the coming years - launching five IRS satellites using PSLVs from SHAR. Several GSLV flights using the Russian cryogenic stages and indigenously developed cryogenic motors are also planned. Dr. Vasantha said, ""We expect to have two or three launches every year in the coming years."" SHAR is all set to become a busy spaceport.","The launch of the IRS-1D with the PSLV-C1 was a significant event despite a minor snag; for the first time, an Indian-made launch vehicle has launched an operational satellite, also made in India, from Indian soil.

The Hindu,1997-11-01 00:00:00,Democracy has won,"Chief Minister Kalyan Singh spoke to Venkitesh Ramakrishnan in New Delhi immediately after the United Front Government reconsidered its recommendation to dismiss his Government.
Democracy has won. And so has the politics of justice, which seeks to usher in an era of governance without corruption, unfair politicking and narrow vested interests. The BSP leadership was afraid of my initiatives against corruption and withdrew support to the Government. The U.F. Government, motivated by the urge to prevent the rise of the BJP, tried to dismiss my Government by creating violence in the Assembly and preventing us from proving the Government's majority. Both have failed.

There are allegations that you indulged in horse-trading and engineered defections.

We have not engineered defections. All those who came to us have come with affection. These are politicians who are fed up with the climate of political instability in Uttar Pradesh and have joined hands with the BJP to provide a stable government. We have not offered these groups and their MLAs any enticements.

Did you offer MLAs of the breakaway Congress group ministerial posts?

They have joined hands with the BJP with full responsibility, to tackle the problems of the State and to contribute their share in mitigating them. And they will address this responsibility as Ministers too. What is wrong in that?

But these MLAs have no ideological ties with the BJP. Is not the offer of ministerial posts intended to entice them to defect?

They have made it clear that they are aligning themselves with the BJP to provide a stable government. They know that that is important for the development of the State. That is the ideological affinity between us.

What about issues such as the construction of a Ram temple at Ayodhya?

That is not on the agenda of the State Government. I have made it clear that the construction can be completed only when the BJP comes to power at the Centre.

Many people in your party say in private that the BJP has lost the support of Dalits because of the break with the BSP.

I was confident right from the beginning that the BJP has the goodwill to attract people from other parties who are interested in the welfare of the State. Some of our leaders might have had different opinions on this. But all that is over now. As for arguments about losing the Dalit vote, I only wish to say that the people of U.P. are fed up with caste politics. The BJP's people-oriented policies will bring all castes and communities to our side.

You have ordered inquiries into corruption charges against Mayawati. Some BJP Ministers are also under a cloud on account of certain deals and projects. Will you take the same steps against BJP Ministers?","Kalyan Singh, the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, was interviewed by Venkitesh Ramakrishnan after the United Front Government decided to reconsider their recommendation to dismiss his government. Singh stated that democracy has won and that initiatives against corruption have led to the success of the politics of justice. Additionally, he denied allegations of horse-trading and defections. Singh claimed that the politicians who joined the BJP were motivated by a desire for political stability and did not require any enticements.

In response to questions about the BJP's ideological stance, Singh explained that the construction of a Ram temple at Ayodhya is not on the agenda of the State Government and that this can only be completed when the BJP is in power at the Centre. He also addressed concerns about losing the support of Dalits, stating that the BJP's policies will attract people from all castes and communities.

Regarding the inquiries into corruption charges against Mayawati, Singh clarified that he will take the same steps against BJP ministers who are involved in corrupt practices.",Politics,173,461
The Hindu,1997-11-01 00:00:00,From demon to god,"DELIRIOUS with joy outside Rashtrapati Bhavan, Bharatiya Janata Party leaders showered praise on President K.R. Narayanan when they learnt that the Union Cabinet had revoked its decision to impose Central rule in Uttar Pradesh. ""He will go down in history as the saviour of democracy,"" said BJP president L.K. Advani. ""The real hero of the affair is the President,"" added general secretary Pramod Mahajan. ""Hats off to him!"" Right-wing media commentators went even further. Narayanan's action, wrote The Pioneer's editor Chandan Mitra, ""cannot but remind us of the words of Bhagwad Gita - sambhavami yuge yuge - Krishna's promise to return in every age to prevent the triumph of evil.""

Yet in July 1997, when the scholarly and distinguished Narayanan, who had risen from humble origins, was elected President, he was subjected to a venomous attack by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP). Although Narayanan's candidacy was supported by the BJP, for the simple reason that any other course of action would have left it open to charges of being anti-Dalit, no leader of the party ever condemned the VHP's abusive behaviour. Not a single word of reproach was delivered by the Sangh parivar's apex body, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), to the central figure in the attack, VHP president Ashok Singhal. Singhal, like most top-rung leaders of the BJP, is its long-standing RSS member, and served as a Prant Pracharak (regional organiser) of the RSS for years.

In a country with an effective legal system, both the VHP and Singhal could have faced the consequences of defamation and incitement to communal hatred. During the run-up to the presidential election, Singhal let it be known that he wanted a ""pro-Hindu"" President - and, in his view, Narayanan did not fit this description. In an interview to the Internet magazine Rediff On The Net, the VHP president explained his rationale to journalist George Iype: ""Narayanan is a Dalit Hindu only on paper. His bent of mind, philosophy of life and his life-long activities are all distinctly anti-Hindu."" The evidence? His Burmese-origin wife, Usha Narayanan, who the VHP claims was a Christian who changed her name. Papers that purport to show that the President's parents had longstanding contact with Christian groups in their home district of Kottayam, Kerala. And the claim that Narayanan, who rose from humble origins, received financial aid from missionary organisations to study for his bachelor's degree.

If this itself was replete with falsehood and suggested paranoia, Singhal went on relentlessly. Narayanan's rise to high office, he claimed, was part of a ""larger conspiracy of the Church to make Rashtrapati Bhavan a bastion of Christianity."" For the VHP leader, evidence of this lay in Narayanan's reported participation in a conference of the Geneva-based World Council of Churches (WCC), an apex body for several Christian denominations, a decade ago. The head of the pro-BJP National Harijan Action Council, M.K. Kunjhol, seconded the proposition of deep links with a supposedly malevolent WCC. Evidence? The tiny home of Narayanan's sister Gowri and brother Bhaskaran in Uzhavoor village looked to Kunjhol like a ""small chapel"". ""The people who have relations with the World Christian Council, which is piloting and financing the conversion of Dalits, the poor and the backward classes in India, will now rally behind Narayanan,"" he asserted.

The VHP's assault on Narayanan is representative of much revanchist material on the Internet, a medium that seems to attract religious bigots and peddlers of pornography like honey does flies. What was disturbing about this particular affair, however, was that it was led not by an unknown, neurotic non-resident Indian in, say, Milwaukee, but the head of a well-entrenched theocratic-political organisation. The VHP faxed and mailed documents outlining its stand to newspapers around the country with impunity. Singhal was not disowned by the BJP or the RSS, whose leadership has now discovered Krishna-like qualities in the President.","
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies praised President K.R. Narayanan for revoking the decision to impose Central rule in Uttar Pradesh. However, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) launched a vicious attack on Narayanan, claiming that he was not a ""pro-Hindu"" President and that his rise to high office was part of a ""larger conspiracy of the Church to make Rashtrapati Bhavan a bastion of Christianity."" The VHP's assault on Narayanan is representative of much revanchist material on the Internet, and it is disturbing that it was led by the head of a well-entrenched theocratic-political organisation. The BJP and the RSS did not disown Singhal, and the leadership of these organisations has now discovered Krishna-like qualities in the President.",Politics,120,642
The Hindu,1997-11-15 00:00:00,In pursuit of power,"The events in U.P. mark a key shift in the BJP's pursuit of power: it is now ready openly to engineer splits in other parties and accept support from splinter groups. COMMENTING on the recent political developments, including the survival of the Kalyan Singh Government in Uttar Pradesh and the creation of the jumbo Ministry thereafter, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president L.K. Advani indicated that the events reflected a change in the party's stand. The BJP is ready to accept splinter groups from other parties, including the Congress, and form coalition ministries. Advani added that the BJP was even willing to consider joining hands with a section of the Congress and forming a Government at the Centre. What is significant about this statement is the absence of emphasis on any of the BJP's professed political and ideological commitments and the acceptance of these commitments by the prospective allies.

This undoubtedly marks an important shift in the BJP's pursuit of power at the national level. Until the recent events in Uttar Pradesh, the BJP's strategy to augment its Hindutva-based vote bank and capture power at the Centre involved forming coalitions with regional and caste-based parties such as the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), the Samata Party, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and factions of the Telugu Desam. The idea was to contest elections in alliance with these parties and evolve a majority for a coalition at the Centre.

According to sources within the BJP, what the party and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the mother organisation of the Hindutva combine, aimed at was a loose tactical combination that would not overly militate against the essential secular character of these parties, even while adhering to the Hindutva objective of developing a pan-Hindu political identity in the country. This short-term strategy was reflected in the care taken by the BJP leadership in the last three years to tone down its extremist Hindutva agenda based on the Ayodhya, Kashi and Mathura temple agitations. When the alliance with the BSP was formed in Uttar Pradesh in March 1997, the combine's assessment was that it had made a significant beginning in this direction.","The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has made a significant shift in its pursuit of power at the national level. The party is now willing to openly engineer splits in other parties and accept support from splinter groups, even if this means compromising its professed political and ideological commitments. This marks a departure from its previous strategy of forming coalitions with regional and caste-based parties.

According to sources within the BJP, the party and its mother organization, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), aim to develop a pan-Hindu political identity in the country. To achieve this goal, they are willing to form loose tactical alliances with other parties, even if these parties do not fully align with the BJP's Hindutva ideology.

This new approach is evident in the BJP's recent actions in Uttar Pradesh, where the party has formed a government with the support of splinter groups from the Congress and other parties. This move signals the BJP's willingness to compromise its principles in order to gain power at the Centre.",Politics,169,358
The Hindu,1997-11-29 00:00:00,The Politics of blackmail,"The United Front stands up to the Congress(I)'s politics of blackmail over the Jain Commission's Interim Report - and pays the price of unity. PRAVEEN SWAMI VENKITESH RAMAKRISHNAN in New Delhi: ""BEHIND you is a bottomless well,"" a Congress(I) politician is believed to have told party president Sitaram Kesri recently, ""but ahead lies an impassable swamp."" The fall of the second United Front Ministry in New Delhi might best be read as an illustration of the Congress(I)'s ideological demise. The party's determination to use the Justice Milap Chand Jain Commission's Interim Report on the events leading up to the 1991 assassination of Rajiv Gandhi to exert leverage over the U.F. - leverage that the Congress(I) had lost following its Uttar Pradesh debacle in October - generated a wholly unproductive political crisis. With the political landscape fundamentally divided among three political formations and with almost no chance that fresh elections will change this situation, the Congress(I)'s decision to initiate the blackmail that has led to the destabilisation of the U.F. Government is mystifying. At the core of this mindless course of action lies a pantomime of 'loyalty' to the memory of Rajiv Gandhi: a 'loyalty' which in fact articulates the belief that his name is no more than electorally encashable capital.

The winter session of Parliament ought to have focussed on the sordid game of defection played by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Uttar Pradesh in October. The session also had important legislative business on hand; it was to deal with the Anti-Defection Act (Amendement) Bill, the Women's Reservation Bill, the Lok Pal Bill, the Prasar Bharati Act (Amendment) Bill, the Insurance Regulatory Bill, the Money Laundering Bill, the Foreign Exchange Management Bill and the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission Bill, among others.

It was instead hijacked through an ill-conceived and insincere parading of loyalty to the memory of Rajiv Gandhi. Farcically, the Congress(I) assault was led by luminaries like the leader from Madhya Pradesh, Arjun Singh, who not long ago claimed that fighting communalism was the principal item on his agenda. That the wholly serious issues confronting Indian democracy were displaced by Jain's Interim Report, appropriately described by former Prime Minister V.P. Singh as a rehash of the Congress(I)'s affidavit before the Jain Commission, and also as ""justice retired,"" is tragic.

The Interim Report had been almost universally attacked in the media - editorially and by independent commentators - for its politically fraught enterprise of conflating fact with fiction. Observers, cutting across party lines, attacked the Commission's reign of error and omission. Predictably, none of this studied criticism appears to have influenced those in the Congress(I) who have chosen to dethrone the U.F. Government.

The delivery on November 24 of the U.F.'s letter, in which it refused to comply with the Congres(I)'s demand that it eject the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) from its ranks, marked the end of one of India's most pointless political crises. The crisis had its origins in the Congress(I)'s obsessive determination to bring down Prime Minister I.K. Gujral's Government and it can only be explained in terms of its inability to forge a meaningful political - or for that matter social and economic - agenda. Many in the Congress(I) believe that the revival of Rajiv Gandhi's memory is the only seed that can flourish into a suitable electoral harvest. Heartened by the prospect of electoral alliances with Laloo Prasad Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) in Bihar and Defence Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav's Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh, some Congress(I) leaders from northern India believe that they can redeem their crippled apparatus. In the southern States, and in States such as Haryana and Rajasthan, local discontent is seen as offering the potential of electoral gains. The unifying theme for this enterprise is, of course, the seemingly emotive image of Rajiv Gandhi's widow asking India's people for vengeance against her husband's murderers. That this vision, like the Interim Report, is founded more on fiction than fact has largely been ignored by the Congress(I).

FEW in the U.F. leadership understood the depth of desperation in the Congress(I) when the first threats against the Government were made after the media leak of the Jain Commission's Interim Report. As late as November 11, when Kesri addressed a party rally at the Netaji Indoor Stadium in Calcutta, there was little reason to believe that the Report had been accorded such a level of importance as to lead to the party's withdrawal of support to the U.F. Kesri devoted his speech to attacking the Left Front in West Bengal and the BJP in Uttar Pradesh. The Congress(I), he said, supported the U.F. Government ""because the people had not given us a mandate to rule""; but, he added, it might have to reconsider this situation since ""this Government has no courage to rule the country.""

On the same day in New Delhi, Congress(I) vice-president Jitendra Prasada made some noises. ""The Union Home Minister,"" he said, ""should not stand in the way of exposing the face of Rajiv Gandhi's assassins."" His party colleague K. Karunakaran, the former Chief Minister of Kerala, declared that ""no Congressman can allow the killers of our beloved leader to go scot-free.""","
After the release of the Jain Commission's Interim Report, the Congress(I) started blackmailing the U.F. government to bring it down. This was because the Congress(I) had lost its power in Uttar Pradesh and was looking for a way to regain it. The U.F. government refused to comply with the Congress(I)'s demands and was eventually brought down. The Congress(I)'s actions were motivated by its desire to exploit the death of Rajiv Gandhi for electoral gains.",Politics,74,861

Indian Express,1997-12-15 00:00:00,Election '98 promises to be crucial for both voters and political parties,"It may be an election that no sitting MP in his heart of hearts really desired, but it could well turn out to be a poll that marks a turning point in Indian politics.

Exasperated with the experience of having three prime ministers in 19 months and protracted bouts of non-governance, the 630 million voters of the world's largest democracy have a chance of either putting things straight or catapulting the country into an existential crisis from which it may not recover.

In retrospect, the 1998 election may be a mere episode in India's development into a mature democracy, but it will be an occasion for the voter to exercise some real options:
Is single party rule preferable to unstable coalitions?
Can pre-poll coalitions provide greater stability than post-election arrangements of expediency?
Is caste or religious identity more relevant than actual governance?
Should a parliamentary election become, in effect, a presidential contest?
Can the country afford prime ministers who lack mass bases and an all-India acceptance?
Should professed ideology take precedence over the cohesiveness of the formations?
These are complex long-term questions with no easy and universally acceptable answers. But it was the inability of the electorate to address these issues in 1996 that led to the 11th Lok Sabha becoming one of the most short-lived in history.

During the campaign, INDIA TODAY will raise these questions. In the first week after dissolution, however, the focus is on the obvious problems facing the BJP, Congress and United Front (UF) as they enter battle.","The upcoming Indian election, driven by voter frustration with frequent changes in leadership and a lack of effective governance, presents a crucial moment in the country's political landscape. With three prime ministers in just 19 months and ongoing governance challenges, the 630 million voters have an opportunity to shape India's future. Key questions loom large for voters, including whether single-party rule is preferable to unstable coalitions, the potential for pre-poll coalitions to offer greater stability, the relevance of caste or religious identity versus actual governance, and whether parliamentary elections should essentially become presidential contests.

Moreover, the issue of whether the country can afford prime ministers lacking broad support and whether ideology should take precedence over coalition cohesion must be addressed. These are complex, long-term questions with no easy solutions. The failure to tackle these issues in the 1996 elections resulted in one of the shortest-lived Lok Sabhas in history. As the campaign unfolds, INDIA TODAY will delve into these issues, but the initial focus remains on the challenges faced by major political players like the BJP, Congress, and United Front as they enter the electoral battleground.",Politics,186,253
The Tribune ,1998-01-06 00:00:00,Patents Ordinance gets approval,"The Union Cabinet today approved the promulgation of an Ordinance to amend the Patents Act, 1970, on the lines of the Patents (Amendment) Bill, 1998 as passed by the Rajya Sabha.

The Patents (Amendment) Bill, 1998, was introduced in the winter session of Parliament. It was passed by the Rajya Sabha on December 22 with one official amendment introduced by the government. However, the Bill could not be taken up and the Lok Sabha was adjourned sine die on December 23. As per the ruling of the disputes settlement body of the World Trade Organisation, India has time till April 19, to fulfil its obligations.

The Cabinet also decided to repromulgate the Central Vigilance Commission and Prasar Bharati Ordinances.

It had become imperative for the government to resort to the repromulgation of these Ordinances as it could not get the relevant Bills, to replace the Ordinances, passed during the winter session of Parliament.

The original CVC Ordinance was amended on October 28 after amicus curiae Anil Diwan pointed out some deficiencies in it and sought the intervention of the Supreme Court.

The revalidation of the Central Vigilance Commission Ordinance, 1998, and the Central Vigilance Commission (Amendment) Ordinance, 1998, would enable the government to give continued effect to the provisions of the two Ordinances after January 11.

The CVC Bill, 1998, as finalised by the Legislative Department, was introduced in the Lok Sabha on December 7. The Bill has since been referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs.

On the Prasar Bharati front, the then Information and Broadcasting Minister, Mrs Sushma Swaraj, had succeeded in getting an Ordinance promulgated on August 29 to restore the original Prasar Bharati Act of 1990 leading to the ouster of Chief Executive S.S. Gill.

The Ordinance fixed the age limit of the CEO at 62 and provided for the establishment of a parliamentary committee to oversee the functioning of a broadcasting corporation and a broadcasting council.

The Ordinance was earlier promulgated as the BJP-led government felt that the Prasar Bharati (Broadcasting Corporation of India) Amendment Ordinance, 1997, issued during the United Front Government’s regime, had led to the deletion of or changes in several provisions of the 1990 Act which resulted in the dilution of the accountability of the Prasar Bharati Corporation. The Ordinance promulgated on August 29, 1998, was due to lapse on January 10.

It also decided to repromulgate an Ordinance allowing companies to buyback their own shares.

The Companies (Amendment) Ordinance, 1998, was to expire on January 10.

The Ordinance seeks to allow companies to buyback their own shares, to provide for nomination facility to the holders of the shares, debentures and deposits, to set-up the ""investor education and protection fund"", to make a provision for the issuance of sweat equity and to include infrastructure development finance company limited as a public finance institution.

Under the Constitution, an Ordinance expires six weeks after the commencement of the Parliament session if the House does not approve it.

The Cabinet also deferred the finalisation of the Ninth Five-Year Plan to enable an in-depth discussion on the voluminous draft Plan.

The finalisation of the Ninth Plan (1997-2002), which has been delayed for almost two years now, did not get the Cabinet nod as several ministers felt that the important document required a detailed discussion.

According to official sources, a meeting had now been fixed for January 10 to discuss the draft Plan.

Once the Cabinet clears the Plan, the Centre is expected to convene a meeting of the National Development Council for its clearance.

The finalisation of the Plan had got delayed due to the change in the government and the incorporation of several new programmes on its agenda. The Prime Minister, who is also the Chairman of the Planning Commission, had desired that the Plan should incorporate a five point action programme on agriculture, rural development, information technology, social infrastructure and water policy.

Keeping in view the international and domestic economic environment, the commission has already revised the targeted economic growth rate from 7 per cent to 6.5 per cent. The estimated budgetary support for the draft Plan has been fixed at Rs 374,000 crore.","The Union Cabinet approves an Ordinance to amend the Patents Act, 1970, following the Patents (Amendment) Bill, 1998, as passed by the Rajya Sabha. The Cabinet also decides to repromulgate the Central Vigilance Commission and Prasar Bharati Ordinances, which were not passed during the winter session. The Prasar Bharati Ordinance aims to restore the original Prasar Bharati Act of 1990, with provisions like the age limit of the CEO at 62 and parliamentary oversight.

The Tribune,1998-01-12 00:00:00,Vajpayee says ‘no’,"NEW DELHI, Nov 30 — Assured of the support of the allies to the BJP-led coalition government, the Prime Minister, Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee, today rejected the Opposition’s demand for the resignation of his government in the wake of the BJP’s defeat in the recently held assembly elections in Delhi, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister M.L. Khurana told mediapersons that partners in the BJP-led alliance had reiterated support at a meeting of the allies which was convened by the Prime Minister. The meeting was also attended by representatives of the AIADMK. The Minister of Law and Justice, Mr Thambi Durai, had met Mr Vajpayee twice since yesterday, he said.

Mr Khurana said the Prime Minister while rejecting the Opposition’s demand for the resignation of his government pointed out that there was no such precedent when a ruling party at the Centre had resigned because of poor performance in assembly elections.

In 1993 when the Congress was in power at the Centre, the party had lost assembly elections in several states, including Delhi and Rajasthan, but the minority government had continued, Mr Vajpayee argued.

Accepting the election results, the Prime Minister said the party should introspect to determine reasons for its defeat. ""We should not feel disappointed but try to take corrective measures"", he said adding that the party had won all six Lok Sabha byelections in the past eight months. This indicated that the people had not rejected the Central Government policies and programmes, he asserted.

The Prime Minister gave a detailed account of the initiatives taken by the government to control prices. A long-term plan was to set a chain of cold storages for preservation of perishable commodities. Both private and public sectors would be involved in this effort.

Mr Vajpayee said farmers should get remunerative prices even in case of a good crop. At the same time, it should be ensured that commodities were made available to consumers at reasonable prices even if crops failed due to natural calamities.

The Prime Minister said the Centre would come down heavily on hoarders. The Centre, he said, would bring a Bill to strengthen the Essential Commodities Act during this session. Meanwhile, the states could initiate action against hoarders under various existing laws.","In response to demands from the opposition for the resignation of his government following the BJP's defeat in recent assembly elections, Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee rejected the calls for resignation. Vajpayee expressed the assurance of support from his coalition government's allies during a meeting with them. He argued that there was no precedent for a central ruling party to resign due to poor performance in state assembly elections and cited the Congress Party's continuation of a minority government in 1993 under similar circumstances. Vajpayee encouraged the party to introspect the reasons for its defeat and highlighted government initiatives to control prices and plans to establish a chain of cold storages for preserving perishable commodities. He also pledged to take action against hoarders and strengthen the Essential Commodities Act.",Politics,129,374
The Tribune,1998-01-12 00:00:00,RLM asks PM to quit; LS adjourned,"began on a heated note today with agitated members of the Rashtriya Janata Dal-Samajwadi combine, the Rashtriya Loktantrik Morcha, demanding govern-ment’s resignation over its failure to contain prices of essential commodities and forcing adjournment of the House for the day without transaction of business. The Opposition staged a walkout in the Rajya Sabha.

Members of the RLM were on their feet soon after the House went through the ritual obituary references and raised slogans, demanding Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee’s resignation.

Even as the Speaker, Mr G M C Balayogi, called the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Sharad Pawar, to speak, the members of the RJD-SP combine rushed into the well of the House and started raising slogans against the government.

Mr Pawar was heard saying he had given a notice seeking suspension of question hour and had pressed for a discussion on the abnormal rise in prices.

A sombre BJP, led by the Prime Minister, the Home Minister, Mr L K Advani, and other Cabinet members remained mute spectators as members of the RLM raised slogans like ""Vajpayee istipha do"" (Vajpayee resign). They said the BJP-led coalition had no moral justification for remaining in office after the people had voted against it in the just concluded poll.

After 25 minutes of noisy scenes and Speaker’s appeal to the members to maintain order, Mr Balayogi adjourned the House till 1400 hours.

When the House reassembled, the RLM members again trooped into the well of the House amidst sloganeering. They refused to heed to the Speaker’s appeal for restoration of decorum in the House. Congress members, however, remained silent.

Some members of the BJP tried to counter the RLM onslaught by trading counter-charges but senior leaders like Mr L K Advani and Mr Murli Manohar Joshi restrained them.

The Speaker tried to persuade the agitated members to return to their seats, saying that the House was ready to discuss price rise and other important issues as demanded by several members.

At one stage he chided the Opposition, saying that it was not the proper way to raise any matter. When the House was willing to discuss the issue threadbare, he said he did not understand the reason behind such an act.

The president of the RLM, Mr Mulayam Singh Yadav, said there was no question of retreat on the price issue and the government should quit. He said apart from the price rise issue, there were many issues which needed to be raised in the House.

The Speaker finally adjourned the House for the day.

Outgoing Delhi Chief Minister Sushma Swaraj, who resigned as Information and Broadcasting Minister but retained her Lok Sabha seat, was conspicuous by her absence.","The winter session of the Lok Sabha in India began with a heated atmosphere as members of various opposition parties, including the Rashtriya Janata Dal-Samajwadi combine and the Rashtriya Loktantrik Morcha, demanded the government's resignation over its inability to control rising prices of essential commodities.

The Tribune,1998-02-28 00:00:00,"Sabarmati Express set ablaze, 57 dead","As many as 57 passengers, most of them “Ram sevaks” returning here from Ayodhya, were killed and 43 injured when miscreants set on fire four coaches of the Sabarmati Express at Godhra railway station in Panchmahal district of Gujarat today, state Home Secretary K. Nityanandum said.

Among the injured were 31 men, nine women and three children. Of them, 20 passengers, who sustained serious burn injuries, were admitted to a hospital at Godhra, Mr Nityanandum said.

One of the coaches of the 18-bogie train was completely burnt, he said.

Indefinite curfew was clamped and the shoot-at-sight order issued in Godhra town immediately after the incident as large-scale violence erupted.

The police fired five rounds to contain the rioting mobs in the town.

Gujarat Minister of State for Home Gordhanbhai Zadafia told the state Assembly that stringent action would be taken against those who indulged in violence.

Chief Minister Narendra Modi, who was present in the House, assured the agitated members that a high-level probe had been ordered into the incident.

Mr Modi announced an ex gratia of Rs 2 lakh to next of kin of those killed in the attack.

Later, Mr Zadafia rushed to Godhra for an on-the-spot inquiry. Health Minister Ashok Bhatt also rushed to the town.

Some “Ram sevaks” were still missing as rescuers rummaged through the badly gutted bogies, sources said.

According to the sources, some miscreants boarded the train coming from Faizabad via Ayodhya, at Godhra station at around 8 am and attacked two coaches carrying “Ram sevaks”, with petrol and acid bombs. They also threw stones at them, the police said.

The railway police opened fire to quell the attacking mob who threw stones at the train which was stopped at the signal point near the station.

Sporadic violence was reported in Godhra town after the news about the attack spread. There were reports of gunfire in the town.

Meanwhile, passengers of the Sabarmati Express disembarked at Anand when it reached the railway station at 3 p.m. and killed a man waiting on the platform to go to Ahmedabad. Two women, who accompanied him, were injured and hospitalised. Earlier, when the train reached Vadodara, the police had to lathi-charge to disperse a mob at the railway station.

There were clashes in the Neelam Lodge area in curfew-bound Godhra, too, where hundreds of people, in groups, threw stones at one another. The police had to lathi-charge and use teargas to disperse the mobs. Deputy SP Neelesh Parmar said four rounds were also fired in the air to quell the mobs.

The police has arrested 30 persons in Godhra in connection with the violence.

Eyewitnesses said the miscreants numbered about 500. They said that as soon as the train reached Godhra, some of the miscreants had attacked the passengers chanting religious songs inside the compartment.

However, even after some passengers brought this to the notice of the policemen present on the platform, no action was taken, the eyewitnesses said.

As the train left Godhra station, one of the miscreants who had boarded it, pulled the chain alarm after some time to halt the train a km away. It was here that a large number of stone-pelting miscreants set the coach ablaze by throwing petrol bombs and dousing it with kerosene and petrol. The VHP has called a ‘Gujarat bandh’ tomorrow in protest against the killing of “Ram sewaks” at Godhra.","On February 27, 2002, a coach of the Sabarmati Express train caught fire at the Godhra railway station in Gujarat, resulting in the deaths of 57 passengers, mostly ""Ram sevaks"" returning from Ayodhya.

Indian Express,1998-03-14 00:00:00,"""Chacha bye, bye! Sonia takes over""","The headline ""Chacha bye, bye! Sonia takes over"" - March 14, 1998 from The Indian Express is a reference to the election of Sonia Gandhi as the President of the Indian National Congress (INC) on that day. She succeeded Sitaram Kesri, who had been appointed as a caretaker president after the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi in 1991.

Sonia Gandhi's election as INC President was a significant event in Indian politics. She was the first foreign-born person to lead the party, and her election was seen as a sign of the party's desperation to revive its fortunes. The INC had been in decline for several years, and it had lost the previous two general elections.

Gandhi's election was met with mixed reactions. Some people welcomed her as a fresh face who could bring new energy to the party. Others were skeptical of her ability to lead the party, given her lack of political experience.

Gandhi proved to be a shrewd and effective politician. She led the INC to victory in the 2004 general election, and she remained the party's president until 2017. She is credited with playing a key role in the party's revival.

The headline ""Chacha bye, bye! Sonia takes over"" is a reflection of the political turmoil and intrigue that surrounded Gandhi's election as INC President. It is also a reminder of the high expectations that people had of her.","Sonia Gandhi was elected as the President of the INC in 1998, becoming the first foreign-born person to lead the party.

The statesman,1998-03-15 00:00:00,India to raise issue of Pak terrorism with Rice,"As US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice arrived here this evening on her maiden bilateral visit to India, key sources in South Block said the Government of India’s focus would be giving a fillip to Indo-US ties rather than Pakistan-related issues.

Pakistan will inevitably come up for discussions between the Indian leadership and Ms Rice and in this context India will raise concern over two issues: (i) Lashkar-e-Toiba’s failed attempt to target India’s IT industry, and (ii) the proposed US arms sales to Pakistan. Sources said India will convey to Ms Rice that the ongoing Indo-Pak peace process would be adversely affected if terrorists were to target Indian IT industry and if Washington were to go ahead with its proposed arms supplies to Islamabad.

Recently Indian security forces had busted a LeT module which revealed that the arrested terrorists had planned to attack offices of Indian IT giants like Infosys. India will convey to Ms Rice that though terrorist activities had been showing a declining trend — as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had himself told Parliament last week that there was a 60 per cent drop in infiltration of terrorists— more needed to be done by Pakistan on this front. Ms Rice would also be told that Washington needed to continue exerting pressure on Islamabad till zero-level of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism is achieved.

On the American arms sales issue, the UPA Government will be making a U-turn on its earlier policy. The late J N Dixit had taken the stand as National Security Adviser that India need not raise the arms sale issue with Washington as the country was well equipped to defend itself. But tomorrow, the Indian leadership would tell Ms Rice that the arms sale and the proposed sale of F-16 fighter aircraft, would damage the Indo-Pak peace process because these kinds of weapons were not required to fight terrorism.

A senior official of the Government of India, when asked by this correspondent as to what would be on top of New Delhi’s agenda during the talks with Ms Rice tomorrow, remarked: “Our focus would be we ourselves. The focus would be Indo-US bilateral relations and not Pakistan-related issues though these issues would definitely be discussed.”

Ms Rice was received at the Palam Technical Area by Mr Jaishanker, Joint Secretary (Americas). All her official engagements are tomorrow, including her call on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Ms Rice’s meeting with External Affairs Minister K Natwar Singh would be spread over two sessions: one in the restricted format (which will be followed by a joint press interaction) and the second one over lunch.

This is the first visit of a Cabinet-level minister from the United States in the second Bush term. It will be followed by the visits of Transportation Secretary Norman Y Mineta and Treasury Secretary John W Snow. This is Ms Rice’s first visit to India and in fact to South Asia. India is the first stop on Ms Rice’s six-nation Asian tour. Foreign office spokesman Navtej Sarna said Ms Rice has been taking a very close interest in the bilateral relationship between India and the United States during the first term of President Bush and has been also focusing on cooperation in defence and economic ties, as well as in the Next Steps in Strategic Partnership (NSSP) process.

There has been encouraging progress in the NSSP. Since October 2004, when NSSP Phase-I came into effect the lower end of the licenses that accounted for almost 30 per cent of the transactions have been completely delicensed. The processing of the higher end licensing has speeded up both quantitatively and qualitatively. Between October, 2004, and January 2005, 185 licenses were approved and only 22 were denied.

Discussions on NSSP Phase-II are continuing. There have been significant steps in the bilateral relationship leading up to this visit. These include cooperation in the tsunami response between India and the US which came as a big boost to India-US military-to-military cooperation and working relationship with the US forces.","US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's maiden bilateral visit to India focuses on bolstering Indo-US ties rather than Pakistan-related issues. India will discuss concerns about Lashkar-e-Toiba's attempted attacks on its IT industry and proposed US arms sales to Pakistan, which could impact the Indo-Pak peace process. India emphasizes the need for Pakistan to curb terrorism, highlighting a recent decline in terrorist activities. The UPA Government shifts its stance on US arms sales, arguing they aren't necessary for counterterrorism efforts. Rice's visit marks the first Cabinet-level visit from the US in the second Bush term, highlighting growing Indo-US cooperation, particularly in defence and economic ties under the Next Steps in Strategic Partnership (NSSP) process. The visit follows encouraging progress in NSSP Phase-I and strengthens military-to-military cooperation post-tsunami response efforts.",National News,128,665
The Tribune,1998-04-15 00:00:00,"Vajpayee govt gets breather AIADMK, allies to continue support","The AIADMK front led by Ms J. Jayalalitha today refrained from withdrawing support to the Vajpayee Government though she was authorised by the front to take ""an appropriate decision at the appropriate time"" on the issue.

""The question of withdrawal of (our) ministers does not arise now"", Union Minister V.K. Ramamurthy told reporters at the end of a 90-minute meeting of the AIADMK and its allies with speculation rife that this was the minimum Ms Jayalalitha was expected to do to set the alarm bells ringing.

Today's meeting of the front at her residence after the failure of talks with the Prime Minister's emissaries yesterday turned out to be another round of ""sparring"" without a ""knock-out punch"" which Ms Jayalalitha had earlier hinted at as it merely resulted in her being authorised to decide on the issue.

Briefing reporters at the end of the 90-minute meeting, Mr Ramamurthy did not rule out the possibility of another meeting on the issue in the near future, saying ""if necessary, we will definitely meet again.""

Mr Ramamurthy said the AIADMK front had rejected outright the recent accord reached on the Cauvery waters issue.

The other leaders of the AIADMK's alliance parties were also present at the briefing.

The meeting was convened by Ms Jayalalitha to discuss the issue of reviewing support to the Vajpayee Government following the Centre's decision to notify the new scheme evolved in consultation with the chief ministers of four riparian states at a meeting with Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee last week.

The notification ignored the threat of reviewing support by Ms Jayalalitha who insisted on the acceptance of the original draft scheme, saying the new scheme was detrimental to the interests of Tamil Nadu.

AIADMK leader Nedunchezhiyan and leaders of alliance partners like Dr Subramanian Swamy (Janata Party), Dr S. Ramadoss (PMK) and Mr Vaiko (MDMK) were also present when Mr Ramamurthy briefed the press on the outcome of the meeting.

After the meeting, all leaders left in one car.

Meanwhile, two top Congress leaders, former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Janardhan Reddy and former union minister Jagdish Tytler, arrived in the city, strengthening speculation that they were here to give an assurance to Ms Jayalalitha about an alternative government at the Centre.

Mr Reddy told a private television channel here that the Congress would not shirk its reponsibility, if it was called upon to form a government after the fall of the Vajpayee Government.

Front sources said before the meeting that there was no unanimity among the allies on the issue of pulling out of the Vajpayee Government as some of the allies would not be ""comfortable"" in a set-up headed by the Congress.

Union Minister M. Thambidurai who along with Mr Kadambur M.R. Janardhanam was present at the meeting, declined to say anything on the nature of the deliberations.

Going by the briefing, it appeared that the Vajpayee Government had got a breather for the time being as a decision was only deferred.

The meeting heightened media interest with even Delhi-based correspondents of leading US papers descending on Poes Garden.

A large number of partymen and curious passersby stayed put outside Ms Jayalalitha's residence when the meeting was going on and refused to leave even after the formal briefing by Mr Ramamurthy.

NEW DELHI: The Congress today denied that it had sent any emissary to Chennai to meet AIADMK chief J. Jayalalitha seeking her party’s support in the formation of a Congress-led government at the Centre in case she decided to pull out of the Vajpayee Government.

Party spokesperson Girija Vyas said this when asked by reporters to comment on reports from Chennai suggesting that certain senior Congress leaders had been sent there to meet Ms J. Jayalalitha.

Meanwhile, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Sharad Pawar, and senior party leader Arjun Singh suggested that the situation was still unclear as regards the stand of the AIADMK-led front.

""Hypothetical situations will get only hypothetical answers"", Mr Arjun Singh said.

Mr Pawar said the party had so far not got any ""authentic"" information on the developments in Chennai and that he expected some ""definite"" information later.","The AIADMK front, led by J. Jayalalitha, refrains from withdrawing support to the Vajpayee Government despite dissatisfaction over the Cauvery waters issue. Following a meeting, Union Minister V.K. Ramamurthy states that withdrawal of ministers isn't imminent. The AIADMK rejects the recent Cauvery accord and authorizes Jayalalitha to decide on the issue. Speculation arises about Congress leaders' visit to Chennai, hinting at potential government formation talks. Congress denies sending emissaries. Opposition leaders express uncertainty over AIADMK's stance. Media interest intensifies, but the situation remains unclear. Leaders avoid giving concrete answers, awaiting further developments from Chennai regarding AIADMK's decisions.",Local News,97,688

The Tribune,1998-07-07 00:00:00,Buddhadeb meets Advani Seeks review of decision on rly bifurcation,"Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani said today that he would speak to Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee regarding West Bengal Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharyya’s demand for setting up of an experts’ committee for studying the Eastern Railway zone bifurcation issue, which had become a bone of contention between Bihar and West Bengal.

“I have spoken to Mr Nitish Kumar (Railway Minister) yesterday. I will speak to the Prime Minister about it,” Mr Advani told newspersons after a 25-minute meeting with the West Bengal Chief Minister.

Mr Bhattacharyya, who called on the Deputy Prime Minister this afternoon, urged him to set up an experts’ committee to study the entire bifurcation issue of the Kolkata-based Eastern Railway zone as it had resulted in “growing tension” between Bihar and West Bengal.

Emerging out of the meeting, Mr Bhattacharyya said, “this is not a simple problem between two states. The Railway Ministry is planning to re-organise railway division all over the country and similar problems may crop up elsewhere too. The status quo should be maintained.”

Mr Bhattacharyya said he wanted friendly ties with neighbouring states and “bifurcation of the zone will be a wrong decision which can be used by parochial forces to reap benefits”.

A review by an experts’ committee would help protect the interests of the state and also lead to an amicable solution to the problem, the Chief Minister said.

Asked as to what was Mr Advani’s response, Mr Bhattacharyya said he gave a patient hearing.

Maintaining that Centre-state relations were a two-way traffic, the Chief Minister said it was the Railway Ministry which had been insisting on re-organising railway divisions across the country.

Mr Bhattacharyya said he also raised the issue of the sick Haldia Petrochemicals and the suspension of flight by Dutch Airlines KLM to Kolkata and sought the Centre’s intervention. He also raised the problems pertaining to coal mines in the state.

On Haldia Petrochemicals, Mr Advani said he had spoken to Petroleum Minister Ram Naik who “is dealing with the matter” and also to Minister of State for Coal Ravi Shankar Prasad.

Regarding the move of the KLM to suspend flights to Kolkata, Mr Advani said he would speak to Civil Aviation Minister Shahnawaz Hussain “on why some airlines are leaving”.

Meanwhile, the CPM demanded a review of the government’s decision to bifurcate Eastern Railway and create a new zone — East-Central Railway — saying that the decision would adversely affect the administrative and functional efficiency.

“A comprehensive review of the decision should be undertaken and any future move should be taken only after a broad and thorough consultation,” the CPM Politburo said in a statement here.

Stressing that this should not be seen as a Bihar versus Bengal issue, the Left party said the consultation should be initiated by the Inter-State Council.

“Until such discussion and a consequent decision is taken, no unilateral and ad hoc proposals should be implemented,” it added.

However, during this specific time frame, it faced numerous obstacles, including the reluctance of the French public to fully embrace the concept of European identity.
 
 The magazine's inability to connect with its audience and effectively communicate the idea of a united Europe could be attributed to various factors, such as the prevailing nationalistic sentiments, skepticism about European integration, and the magazine's own editorial approach.

As soon as the Finance Minister stood up to present his Budget proposals, members of the Haryana Lok Dal (R) got up to protest against certain omissions in the Budget. They continued to heckle the Finance Minister until the Speaker warned them and threatened to name them. Most of what the HLD (R) members, led by Mr Om Parkash Chautala, said was not audible in the press gallery. About 10 minutes after the start of the speech of Mr Shorewala, the HLD (R) members staged a walkout. Soon after that, the Speaker named Mr Randeep Surjewala, who kept standing to make a point in spite of the Speaker's warning. After Mr Surjewala left the House, other Congressmen also walked out.
Mr Shorewala said as per the books of the RBI, the year was likely to open with a surplus balance of Rs 35.51 crore and close with an actual deficit of Rs 48.28 crore and the deficit on the year's account of Rs 83.79 crore. This was against a surplus of Rs 109.19 crore in the revised estimate of 1997-98. This was mainly on account of the fact that the State was implementing a bigger Annual Plan of Rs 2260 crore this year which reflected an increase of 61 per cent over last year's revised Plan of Rs 1400 crore. Haryana was one of the few States having positive balance from current revenues (BCR). Hence the Budget estimates showed a positive BCR of Rs 227.19 crore for the year 1998-99.
Mr Shorewala said while the total receipts for the year were projected at Rs 14084.47 crore the total expenditure was projected at Rs 14168.26 crore.

The State Government, he said, would continue to provide subsidy on power, irrigation, seeds, fertiliser, weedicides and pesticides for the welfare of the agricultural community. Pension to widows, destitute women and senior citizens would also continue.
The Budget deficit, he said, was very much within manageable limits and would be covered by inherent resilience, expected buoyancy in the economy and toning up of tax administration. He expressed the hope that all development programmes envisaged in the Annual Plan would be implemented.
With the revival of excise policy, collections from state taxes would grow at 48.5 per cent to Rs 3584.13 crore in 1998-99 from Rs 2413.42 crore in 1997-98.
Throwing light on the programmes and policies of the government, the Finance Minister reported that an outlay of Rs 505 crore, which was 22.3 per cent of the total Plan outlay, had been kept for generation, transmission and distribution of power, followed by irrigation Rs 550.81 crore (24.4 per cent), including Rs 350 crore for a World Bank-aided Water Resources Consolidation Project. Transport sector including roads, bridges and transport services had been allocated an outlay of Rs 190.61 crore (8.4 per cent), out of which an amount of Rs 100 crore had been kept for Haryana highways upgradation project.

POWER SUPPLY
While reiterating the State Government's commitment to give 24 hours assured power supply to all consumers by the year 2000 and eight hours of uninterrupted supply to the agriculture sector, the Finance Minister informed that a major power restructuring and reforms programme had been undertaken. Financial support of Rs 899.75 crore had been provided for the Haryana State Electricity Board during 1998-99. He said that the agriculture sector would continue to get subsidised supply of power for which over subsidy of power Rs 700 crore was likely to be provided to the board during the course of the year out of which Rs 364 crore would be paid in cash.
The Finance Minister disclosed that the State Government had given top priority to the widening, improvement and upgradation of existing roads and construction of new roads. An amount of Rs 245.41 crore had been proposed for roads and bridges during 1998-99, out of which Rs 151.03 crore would be spent on the maintenance and upgradation of existing roads for a length of 2470 km and Rs 9438 crore for construction of new roads and bridges for a length of 130 km.
NEW SCALES
The Finance Minister informed the House that the State Government had implemented the new pay scales on the pattern of the recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission as accepted by the Government of India. The government employees and pensioners had been granted the benefits of revised emoluments with effect from January 1, 1996, and cash payment had commenced from January 1 last. The arrears had been deposited in the general provident funds of the employees.

The Tribune,1998-07-21 00:00:00,Cong stages walkout in HP Assembly ,"Amidst noisy scenes, the Congress today staged a walkout in the Himachal Vidhan Sabha following refusal by the Chief Minister, Mr P.K. Dhumal, to tender an apology for having ""misled"" people by claiming that grave irregularities were committed while raising loans through commission agents by the previous Congress Government headed by Mr Virbhadra Singh.
The issue was raised through a point of order by Mr Rangila Ram Rao (Cong), who said while outside the House the Chief Minister and other BJP leaders had been claiming that irregularities were committed by the previous government in the payment of commission, but within the House in written reply to a question yesterday Mr Dhumal had made it clear that the commission was paid as per the guidelines of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
The agitated Congress members accused Mr Dhumal and his partymen of having maligned in their election meetings the then Congress Government by accusing it of having committed irregularities in raising these loans.
Mr Virbhadra Singh was not present in the House when the issue was raised.
A senior Congress legislator, Thakur Ram Lal, said Mr Dhumal owed an apology for having levelled ""wrong and baseless"" allegations against the previous government.
He said during the recent assembly elections the BJP leadership tried to create an impression that the then Congress Government was hand in glove with certain commission agents who raised loans for the state. Doubts were sought to be created in the minds of the electorate on the issue of raising of loans so as to erode the credibility of the Congress leadership.
Thakur Ram Lal said the cat was now out of the bag with Mr Dhumal himself admitting in reply to the question that the commission was paid as per the rates fixed by the RBI.
Mr J.B.L. Khachi (Cong) said this was a very serious matter and the BJP leadership could not escape the responsibility of having made irresponsible statements on the issue.
All Congress members were on their feet when the Chief Minister rose to clarify the position. Nothing was audible in the din.
The Congress members shouted that Mr Dhumal was trying to sidetrack the real issue when he said only incomplete information was given in the reply to the yesterday's question which did not come up during question hour. He would have elaborated the real position, had the question come up in the House.
He said Nabard had raised serious objections on the issue of the cooperative bank having raised a loan of Rs 90 crore for which brokerage was paid during the Congress regime.
Mr Dhumal reiterated that the government would come out with a White Paper in which financial irregularities of the Virbhadra Singh government would be listed.
He said he would give a detailed statement on the issue in the House today itself. However, the matter may come up in the House tomorrow.
Other Congress legislators joined Thakur Ram Lal in saying that the Chief Minister's reply to the yesterday's question was exhaustive as details of all loans raised during the four year rule of the Virbhadra Singh government were mentioned in the reply. They alleged that the Chief Minister was now trying to wriggle out of the situation which has been created due to his reply.
Mr Dhumal made it clear that he had an open mind on the entire issue and the truth would come out in the White Paper. He said not all aspects were touched in reply to the yesterday's question. The White Paper would give details of the loans which were raised through the HPSEB, the Forest Corporation and other institutions on commission basis for the previous government.
Not satisfied with this, the Congress members walked out of the House.
Mr J.P. Nadda, Parliamentary Affairs Minister, said the walkout by the Congress members despite the Chief Minister's announcement that he would give a statement on the issue was condemnable. The Congress members were trying to divert the real issue, he added.
Later, addressing newsmen in the Opposition lounge, Thakur Ram Lal, Mr J.B.L. Khachi, Mrs Vidya Stokes and Mr Kaul Singh claimed that the Chief Minister's reply to the yesterday's question has vindicated the position of the Congress.
They did not agree with the Chief Minister that the reply was incomplete. These legislators pointed out that rule 55 of the Rules and Procedures for conduct of business of the House lays down that ""answers given in the House should be complete and as far as possible, each part there of shall be answered separately"".
They said Mr Dhumal should own or disown the reply to the question.
They said that any statement of the Chief Minister on the issue would be irrelevant now as he had already said in his reply that the payment of commission was as per the guidelines of the RBI.
On the other hand, Mr Dhumal told newsmen that there was non question of his seeking an apology. He would come out with facts on the issue, he added.","In the Himachal Pradesh Vidhan Sabha, the Congress staged a walkout after Chief Minister P.K. Dhumal refused to apologise for claiming that the previous Congress government had committed grave irregularities while raising loans through commission agents. The Congress members accused Dhumal of having maligned the previous government during the election campaign by accusing it of committing irregularities in raising loans.

The seven youth were denied visa and the Swiss embassy informed the WFI about a possible racket.
During probe, it became clear that the WFI Assistant Secretary Vinod Kumar had accepted money from the Punjab residents to send them to Switzerland on genuine documents so that at a later stage they could enter some other European destinations by road to evade detection after the expiry of visa.

""Thus far and no further"", a three-Judge Bench headed by Chief Justice Madan Mohan Punchhi told Attorney-General Soli Sorabjee appearing for the Centre when he sought six week's time to resolve the vexed issue of implementation of the June 1991 interim award of the tribunal directing Karnataka to release 205 TMC feet of Cauvery water annually to Tamil Nadu on a weekly basis.
As soon as the proceedings began before the Bench the Judges wanted to know the stand of the Government of India on the issue of framing of a scheme for implementation of the interim award.
Mr Sorabjee submitted before the court that in pursuance of the April 1997 assurance by the government to frame the scheme, discussions had been held at the highest level to achieve implementation of the order in a harmonious way.
""The outcome of these discussions so far has not been successful though the government was hopeful of ironing out the differences and perceptions"", he said.
The Judges repeatedly referred to the apex court order of April 9, 1997, asking the government to frame a scheme for the implementation of the interim award and said the government was bound to do so.
The Attorney-General made it clear that there should not be an impression that the present government wanted to go back on the April 1997 assurance given to the court on framing of the scheme.
""The whole idea is to create a proper atmosphere to ensure that the scheme was implemented in a harmonious way. Enforcement becomes easier when there is acceptability"", Mr Sorabjee said, adding that it was because of the repeated differences over the implementation that the Centre was taking so much time.
Senior counsel for Tamil Nadu K. Parasaran submitted before the court that the controversy centred only around the question of implementation of the April 1997 orders of this court.
Earlier, one of the Judges, Mr Justice K.T. Thomas (who hails from Kerala) dissociated himself from the Bench after Kerala Government counsel P.S. Potti submitted that though the state was not directly concerned over the implementation of the apex court order of April 1997, it was interested in the principles regarding the framing of the scheme.

NEW DELHI, July 21 — Members from Tamil Nadu staged noisy walkouts in both Houses of Parliament today as the government sought time from the Supreme Court on the Cauvery river waters sharing issue to work out an amicable solution in consultation with the four southern states.
Even as members from Tamil Nadu charged the government with ""betrayal"", the Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister, Mr Madan Lal Khurana, told the Lok Sabha that the Prime Minister, Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee, would convene a meeting of the Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and Pondicherry to work out a draft scheme for sharing of the Cauvery waters.
He said the government had sought time from the Supreme Court as no solution was possible at this stage when all states concerned had taken a hardened stand on the issue.
Mr Khurana admitted that the situation might become explosive if the matter remained unresolved and assured the House that the government would work out a solution. He said the Prime Minister during his talks with the Chief Ministers of the four states, he would try to narrow down the differences and aim to resolve the issue.
The minister made the statement after the Cauvery issue rocked Parliament for the second day today with Members from Tamil Nadu insisting on an immediate notification of the scheme for implementation of the Cauvery Tribunal’s interim award for the release of 205 TMC feet of water annually for the state.
Cutting across party lines, Members of the AIADMK and its allies, the DMK and the Tamil Maanila Congress, staged separate walkouts in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha.
The emotive issue saw all the members from Karnataka uniting to oppose the stand taken by the Tamil Nadu Members. They accused Tamil Nadu of political exploitation to wrest more concessions on the Cauvery issue.
Raising the issue during Zero Hour in the Lok Sabha, the AIADMK leader, Mr R.Muthiah, criticised the government for seeking more time and adjournment before the Supreme Court today.
He said the previous United Front government, which had a heavy representation from the DMK and TMC, had betrayed the interests of the state and ""we are seeing the same betrayal now"" from the BJP-led coalition government.
Mr Murasoli Maran of the DMK contested the claim of the AIADMK members and said the previous government had made a draft scheme for sharing of the Cauvery waters but it could not be implemented.
Mr Muthiah wondered why the government was hesitating to notify the scheme and demanded a response from the government. He then led a walkout of his party members from the House.
Mr Vaiko of the MDMK said the BJP government had done injustice to the state by not notifying the scheme and said he had to join the walkout with a ""heavy heart.""
Mr Maran admitted that the issue was a difficult one to resolve and asked why the government was adopting a dilatory attitude. He also led a walkout of his party members. The DMK’s ally, the TMC also followed suit.
Members from Kerala — Mr K. Karunakaran of the Congress and Mr Krishna Das of the CPM — said the Centre should not take any decision on notifying the scheme without involving the state.
It was a similar scene in the Rajya Sabha with the Tamil Nadu members protesting against the Centre’s callous inaction in notifying the scheme to implement the Cauvery Tribunal’s interim award.
The leader of the DMK, Mr Viduthalai Virumbi, AIADMK leader R.Margabandu, Mrs Jayanthi Natarajan of the TMC and their colleagues were up on their feet the moment the Zero Hour began.
The Members charged the BJP-led coalition with adopting delaying tactics and said the government had abdicated its responsibility. Much of what the members said was lost in the din that ensued.
Mr Virumbi read out a prepared statement before leading his Members out of the House.
Irked by the repeated raising of the Cauvery issue in the House, Mr Alladi Rajkumar, leader of the Telegu Desam Party, was heard saying that the House could not allow the issue to be raised again and again.
The issue also figured at the BJP Parliamentary Party meeting this morning with Mr R. Kumara-mangalam presenting the case on behalf of Tamil Nadu and Mr Anantha Kumar arguing the case in favour of Karnataka.
Emerging out of the meeting, the Prime Minister said no solution had been found since the states concerned were adamant on their respective stands. ""We are asking more time from the Supreme Court. In that time we will try to find a solution,"" he said. In case a solution was not found, then the situation could be explosive, he added.
Mr Vajpayee suggested that MPs from the BJP representing the states should sit together and work for a solution. He also said that a similar approach should be adopted by other political parties.
The BJP General Secretary, Mr Venkaiah Naidu, assured that the government could not and would not function under pressure whether it be from Karnataka or Tamil Nadu.
 	Indo-US talks wrapped up
Tribune New Service
NEW DELHI, July 21 — The third round of Indo-US talks ended today with a wrap-up meeting between the US Assistant Secretary of State, Mr Strobe Talbott, and the Prime Minister’s special envoy, Mr Jaswant Singh. The US delegation later left for Islamabad.
While the official sources declined to give details of the meeting today, a Ministry of External Affairs spokesman said that it was a ""wrap-up meeting"". The two sides have agreed to meet for a fourth round of discussions in Washington in the middle of next month.
Mr Jaswant Singh, who is leading the Indian delegation to the next meeting of the Asian Regional Forum (ARF) in Manila on July 28, is expected to meet the US Secretary of State, Ms Madeleine Albright there. Sources said that Ms Albright is expected to give some elaboration on the US stand to Mr Singh.
Mr Talbott had brought a letter for the Prime Minister, Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee, from the US President, Mr Bill Clinton. A reply from Mr Vajpayee is being sent through diplomatic channels, sources said.
Considerable ground was covered at the third round of talks in New Delhi, sources said, adding that the gap between the US and the Indian perceptions on the CTBT, disarmament and non-proliferation issue had been reduced.
Meanwhile, the US Deputy Secretary of State today had a 30-minute meeting with the Congress President, Mrs Sonia Gandhi, during which a wide range of issues, including disarmament and non-proliferation, figured.
The meeting between Mr Talbott and Mrs Sonia Gandhi is considered significant because the US official did not meet the leader of any other political party. He met the Prime Minister, the Home Minister and the Prime Minister’s special envoy, Mr Jaswant Singh. Though Mr Talbott had discussions with the former Prime Minister, Mr I.K.Gujral, yesterday but it was in the capacity of Mr Gujral being a former Prime Minister and the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs.
Though neither the Congress nor the US side gave out any details of the meeting between Mrs Gandhi and Mr Talbott, sources said that the issue of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) figured in the meeting.
A Congress press note said: ""Mrs Gandhi and Mr Talbott discussed a wide range of subjects of mutual interest and concern to both countries. The discussions were held in a cordial atmosphere"".
When asked to give details of the meeting, the Congress spokesman, Mr Ajit Jogi, said that the party was not for a ""compromise on national interest"". The country should not sign the CTBT in the present form and keep its independence of action, Mr Jogi said.
The Congress is of the firm view that the economic sanctions were totally unwarranted and should be withdrawn immediately, Mr Jogi said, adding that India should not be seen with the prism of other countries.","The Supreme Court grants the Union Government three weeks to resolve differences between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu over the implementation scheme of the Cauvery Tribunal's interim award. Attorney-General Soli Sorabjee sought more time, emphasizing efforts to ensure harmonious implementation. Tamil Nadu MPs walk out of Parliament, accusing the government of betrayal for seeking further delay. The Centre plans a meeting of Chief Ministers to draft a scheme for Cauvery water sharing. Indo-US talks end in New Delhi, aiming to bridge gaps on CTBT, disarmament. US envoy Strobe Talbott meets Congress President Sonia Gandhi, discussing mutual concerns, including the CTBT and economic sanctions.",Politics,102,1790

The Tribune,1998-07-22 00:00:00,Pakistan for meaningful talks with India,"
ISLAMABAD, July 22 (PTI) — Pakistan today told the USA that it was ready to have a ""meaningful dialogue"" with India to resolve the Kashmir issue and also to reduce tension in south Asia.
During the official level talks with the visiting us delegation led by Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, Pakistan also opposed any move by the international community to unilaterally grant nuclear status to India.
Mr Talbott met Pakistan Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan today on the second day of talks, which is believed to have focused on Islamabad signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
During the talks, the Foreign Minister expressed ""Pakistan’s desire to have meaningful dialogue with India to reduce tension and resolution of the Kashmir issue,"" a Pakistani official statement said.
Mr Khan also stressed the need for ""preserving peace and security in south Asia,"" the statement added.
Immediately after his arrival yesterday, Mr Talbott had held more than three hours of ""comprehensive and in-depth"" talks with Pakistani officials led by Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed on the non-proliferation issue.
""The discussion focused on post-nuclear test environment in south Asia,"" a Foreign Ministry statement had said last night.
The US side reportedly pressed Pakistan to sign the CTBT and Islamabad in turn demanded lifting of the sanctions imposed by Washington.
The Pakistani media, meanwhile, claimed that Islamabad had expressed its concern over reports emanating from New Delhi after Mr Talbott’s discussions with Indian authorities that India had demanded its recognition as a nuclear power state.
Though Islamabad has shown its flexibility on the signing of the CTBT it has expressed its apprehension that unilateral granting of nuclear status to India by the international community, in any form, will have serious security repercussions for Pakistan.
The possibility of implicit recognition of India as a nuclear weapon state is a major concern for Pakistan and the main reason for its reluctance to sign the CTBT, the report said.
""There was no possibility that Pakistan would settle for anything less than what is awarded to India,’’ 'The Nation’ quoted a senior official in the wake of reports that India had offered to sign the CTBT and the NTP if it is granted nuclear power status.
Mr Talbott today also called on Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and reportedly delivered a message of President Bill Clinton.
The Deputy Secretary of State is expected to wind up his negotiations with a last round of talks with Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed and other Pakistani officials","**Pakistan Ready for ""Meaningful Dialogue"" with India on Kashmir:**

Trouble arose during question hour when Mr Yadav, while putting up a supplementary concerning foreign contributions received by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, made certain remark about Hindu Gods and goddesses.
Agitated BJP members were immediately on their feet protesting against Mr Yadav’s behaviour and accusing him of making casual reference to the Gods. This was countered by RJD and Samajwadi Party members.
Replying to supplementaries from Mr Ajit Jogi and Mr Subramanian Swamy, Home Minister L.K. Advani said the government would not spare any organisation violating the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA).
The minister stated this when Mr Jogi, as also Mr Rajesh Pilot, sought to know what action the government had taken against the VHP following alleged irregularities by it in receiving foreign donations.
The minister said there were as many as 12,136 associations covered under the FCRA Act and such organisations were given permission to receive foreign funds after much scrutiny by the government.
Lankan militants: The Centre and the Tamil Nadu Government are taking coordinated action to prevent any illegal activities by Sri Lankan militants in the state, Home Minister L.K. Advani informed the Lok Sabha today.
Considering that Tamil Nadu had a long coastline, elaborate arrangements had been made for preventing possible infiltration. The state government had intensified security arrangements along the coastline by setting up armed check posts as well as mobile patrols. Besides, the Palk Straits bay was being kept under continuous surveillance by the Navy and coast guard, Mr Advani said in written reply.
The Centre declared the LTTE an unlawful association on May 14. This had strengthened the hands of the state government in containing the activities of LTTE, he added.
In reply to another question, Mr Advani said while the overall situation in Jammu and Kashmir had shown improvement, militants had continued to resort to stray incidents of killings of soft targets, especially members of minority community, in remote areas.
Disturbed area: The Government will take a view on declaring Doda district in Jammu and Kashmir a disturbed area after receiving comments of various security agencies and the state government, Home Minister L.K. Advani said.
Mr Advani said in a written answer that no formal proposal had been received from the state government in this regard, though a demand was raised for declaration of Doda district as disturbed area during his recent visit to Jammu and Kashmir.
Reimbursement: The Centre has reimbursed Rs 1045.31 crore to Jammu and Kashmir during 1990-98 as security-related expenditure, he said, adding Rs 131.91 crore was reimbursed to Assam for the purpose during 1990-95.
Police: In order to strengthen Jammu and Kashmir police, two more India reserve battalions would be created immediately and one more in 1999-2000, he said, adding Rs 5 crore would be made available for modernisation of the state police and 11 Border Police posts would also be established.
Weapons: Weapons seized during the past three years in Kashmir and North-East include AK series rifles, pistols, revolvers, carbines, UMGs, RPGs, LMGs, SLRs, sniper rifles, grenade launchers and rocket launchers.","During a Lok Sabha session, members of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Shiv Sena objected to a remark made by former Bihar Chief Minister Laloo Prasad Yadav.

The Tribune,1998-07-22 00:00:00,	SC gives govt 3 weeks Final reprieve to settle Cauvery row,"The Supreme Court today gave three week's time to the Union Government to iron out differences between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu over the framing of a scheme to implement the interim award of the Cauvery Tribunal and said it was not inclined to grant adjournments beyond August 12.
""Thus far and no further"", a three-Judge Bench headed by Chief Justice Madan Mohan Punchhi told Attorney-General Soli Sorabjee appearing for the Centre when he sought six week's time to resolve the vexed issue of implementation of the June 1991 interim award of the tribunal directing Karnataka to release 205 TMC feet of Cauvery water annually to Tamil Nadu on a weekly basis.
As soon as the proceedings began before the Bench the Judges wanted to know the stand of the Government of India on the issue of framing of a scheme for implementation of the interim award.
Mr Sorabjee submitted before the court that in pursuance of the April 1997 assurance by the government to frame the scheme, discussions had been held at the highest level to achieve implementation of the order in a harmonious way.
""The outcome of these discussions so far has not been successful though the government was hopeful of ironing out the differences and perceptions"", he said.
The Judges repeatedly referred to the apex court order of April 9, 1997, asking the government to frame a scheme for the implementation of the interim award and said the government was bound to do so.
The Attorney-General made it clear that there should not be an impression that the present government wanted to go back on the April 1997 assurance given to the court on framing of the scheme.
""The whole idea is to create a proper atmosphere to ensure that the scheme was implemented in a harmonious way. Enforcement becomes easier when there is acceptability"", Mr Sorabjee said, adding that it was because of the repeated differences over the implementation that the Centre was taking so much time.
Senior counsel for Tamil Nadu K. Parasaran submitted before the court that the controversy centred only around the question of implementation of the April 1997 orders of this court.
Earlier, one of the Judges, Mr Justice K.T. Thomas (who hails from Kerala) dissociated himself from the Bench after Kerala Government counsel P.S. Potti submitted that though the state was not directly concerned over the implementation of the apex court order of April 1997, it was interested in the principles regarding the framing of the scheme.
Initially the court was inclined to adjourn the hearing by a week but after repeated persuasion by the Attorney-General the Judges gave the government three week's time to get back to the court with a final decision.","The Supreme Court gave the Union Government three weeks to resolve differences between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu over the implementation of the interim award of the Cauvery Tribunal.

Sources said that some MPs asked the Prime Minister, Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee, to adopt a tough line on the issue of price rise and suggested action against hoarders so that the government was not perceived as being a helpless spectator.
The meeting, which was chaired by the Prime Minister, was addressed by the Finance Minister, Mr Yashwant Sinha. He explained in detail the phenomenon of recent price rise. Mr Sinha told the meeting that the government would import 1.5 lakh tonnes of edible oil to meet the expected demand during the forthcoming festival season.
The imported palm oil, mainly from Indonesia and Malaysia, would be supplied to the consumers through fair price shops, Mr Sinha said. He said that the government had already reduced the import duty on edible oil from 25 per cent to 10 per cent.
Moreover, the edible oil had been brought under the open general licence so that traders could import it without any hindrance, Mr Sinha, said hoping that these measures would help control the price line.
Describing the present price rise as ""seasonal"", the Finance Minister gave three reasons for the rise: deficit financing, money supply and administrative prices. He said vegetables, fruits and edible oil alone accounted for 86 per cent of the price rise in essential commodities.
Later briefing newspersons, the Parliamentary Affairs Minister, Mr Madan Lal Khurana, said that the Finance Minister told the meeting that the price rise in essential commodities was 3.7 per cent in 1997. It was 5 per cent in April this year and today it stood at 7.5 per cent. Mr Sinha hoped that before the monsoon ends, the prices would stabilise.
Regarding onion and potato, the government would supply these items through NAFED at subsidised rates at Super Bazars and through mobile vans.
Speaking on money supply, the Finance Minister said that there was 17 per cent growth this year. The deficit had gone up by Rs 22,000 crore from the estimates last year. But on the administered price front, petroleum prices had been reduced from 15 per cent to 8 per cent this year, Mr Sinha stressed. The Railway goods fare was only marginally raised, he said.
The MPs asked the government to prepare a small booklet carrying all these facts so that the public could be properly informed.

The allottees had wanted a total withdrawal of the hike of Rs 2.20 lakh which they described as ""completely unjustified.""
The scheme for MIG (super) flats was floated in 1995. The income eligibility was fixed at 2,661 and above per month and the tentative cost of each flat was to be Rs 6.30 lakh. Work on the flats was to be completed by April, 1997.
The flat allocation was done in December, 1995, and flat numbers were given in February this year. In March, the cost of each unit was escalated by Rs 2.20 lakh with the monthly instalment working out to be nearly Rs 10,000. Interestingly, the income eligibility was Rs 2,661 and above.
Sources said here today that following representations from allottees the Finance and Accounts Committee of PUDA refixed the sale price of the 684 MIG (super) flats which was approved by the Chief Administrator.

The Tribune ,1998-07-22 00:00:00,"By 2000, Delhi will have 4 million vehicles","Delhi is expected to have four million vehicles on road by the year 2000, a report said.
The Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) in a report said that if the traffic volume rises at the current rate, the average speed of vehicles in Delhi will be reduced to 11 km per hour by the year 2000. The average speed on the Capital’s roads in 1988 was 25 km per hour.
The urban population has increased from 3.65 million in 1971 to 8.47 million 1991, while the vehicle population has gone up more than nine times from 0.20 million in 1971 to 1.8 million in two decades later, the report said.
The solution, the CRRI report said, lay in improving public transport, regulating urban expansion, increasing the freight movement by rail and putting in place efficient pollution control measures.
In addition to the vehicles registered in Delhi, it has been estimated that about 100,000 vehicles from the neighbouring states also ply on Delhi roads, adding to the congestion and pollution problems.
While the vehicle numbers have gone up more than nine times, the road length has increased by 2.6 times only, resulting in high vehicle density.
While the fast pace of urbanisation has necessitated the need for an efficient transportation system in Delhi, the public transport system has not been up to the mark, forcing commuters to shift to personal vehicles.
The haphazard and unplanned growth of Delhi has aggravated the problem, making it one of the most polluted cities in the world, the study said.
The phenomenal growth registered by motor vehicles in Delhi can be gauged from the fact that while the combined human population of Mumbai, Chennai and Calcutta is about 3.5 times that of Delhi, the vehicular population of Delhi is more than that of the three other cities combined.","According to a report from the Central Road Research Institute (CRRI), Delhi is anticipated to have four million vehicles on its roads by the year 2000.

The CRRI suggests that improving public transport, regulating urban expansion, increasing freight movement by rail, and implementing efficient pollution control measures are essential solutions to the growing congestion and pollution problems. Additionally, about 100,000 vehicles from neighboring states are estimated to ply on Delhi roads, exacerbating congestion and pollution. The unplanned and haphazard growth of Delhi has contributed to its status as one of the most polluted cities globally.

The Tribune,1998-07-22 00:00:00,Indo-US talks wrapped up,"The third round of Indo-US talks ended today with a wrap-up meeting between the US Assistant Secretary of State, Mr Strobe Talbott, and the Prime Minister’s special envoy, Mr Jaswant Singh. The US delegation later left for Islamabad. 
While the official sources declined to give details of the meeting today, a Ministry of External Affairs spokesman said that it was a ""wrap-up meeting"". The two sides have agreed to meet for a fourth round of discussions in Washington in the middle of next month.
Mr Jaswant Singh, who is leading the Indian delegation to the next meeting of the Asian Regional Forum (ARF) in Manila on July 28, is expected to meet the US Secretary of State, Ms Madeleine Albright there. Sources said that Ms Albright is expected to give some elaboration on the US stand to Mr Singh.
Mr Talbott had brought a letter for the Prime Minister, Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee, from the US President, Mr Bill Clinton. A reply from Mr Vajpayee is being sent through diplomatic channels, sources said.
Considerable ground was covered at the third round of talks in New Delhi, sources said, adding that the gap between the US and the Indian perceptions on the CTBT, disarmament and non-proliferation issue had been reduced.
Meanwhile, the US Deputy Secretary of State today had a 30-minute meeting with the Congress President, Mrs Sonia Gandhi, during which a wide range of issues, including disarmament and non-proliferation, figured.
The meeting between Mr Talbott and Mrs Sonia Gandhi is considered significant because the US official did not meet the leader of any other political party. He met the Prime Minister, the Home Minister and the Prime Minister’s special envoy, Mr Jaswant Singh. Though Mr Talbott had discussions with the former Prime Minister, Mr I.K.Gujral, yesterday but it was in the capacity of Mr Gujral being a former Prime Minister and the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs.
Though neither the Congress nor the US side gave out any details of the meeting between Mrs Gandhi and Mr Talbott, sources said that the issue of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) figured in the meeting. 
A Congress press note said: ""Mrs Gandhi and Mr Talbott discussed a wide range of subjects of mutual interest and concern to both countries. The discussions were held in a cordial atmosphere"".
When asked to give details of the meeting, the Congress spokesman, Mr Ajit Jogi, said that the party was not for a ""compromise on national interest"". The country should not sign the CTBT in the present form and keep its independence of action, Mr Jogi said.
The Congress is of the firm view that the economic sanctions were totally unwarranted and should be withdrawn immediately, Mr Jogi said, adding that India should not be seen with the prism of other countries.","The third round of Indo-US talks concluded in New Delhi, with a wrap-up meeting between US Assistant Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and India's Prime Minister’s special envoy Jaswant Singh.

Even as members from Tamil Nadu charged the government with ""betrayal"", the Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister, Mr Madan Lal Khurana, told the Lok Sabha that the Prime Minister, Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee, would convene a meeting of the Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and Pondicherry to work out a draft scheme for sharing of the Cauvery waters.
He said the government had sought time from the Supreme Court as no solution was possible at this stage when all states concerned had taken a hardened stand on the issue.
Mr Khurana admitted that the situation might become explosive if the matter remained unresolved and assured the House that the government would work out a solution. He said the Prime Minister during his talks with the Chief Ministers of the four states, he would try to narrow down the differences and aim to resolve the issue.
The minister made the statement after the Cauvery issue rocked Parliament for the second day today with Members from Tamil Nadu insisting on an immediate notification of the scheme for implementation of the Cauvery Tribunal’s interim award for the release of 205 TMC feet of water annually for the state.
Cutting across party lines, Members of the AIADMK and its allies, the DMK and the Tamil Maanila Congress, staged separate walkouts in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha.
The emotive issue saw all the members from Karnataka uniting to oppose the stand taken by the Tamil Nadu Members. They accused Tamil Nadu of political exploitation to wrest more concessions on the Cauvery issue.
Raising the issue during Zero Hour in the Lok Sabha, the AIADMK leader, Mr R.Muthiah, criticised the government for seeking more time and adjournment before the Supreme Court today.
He said the previous United Front government, which had a heavy representation from the DMK and TMC, had betrayed the interests of the state and ""we are seeing the same betrayal now"" from the BJP-led coalition government.
Mr Murasoli Maran of the DMK contested the claim of the AIADMK members and said the previous government had made a draft scheme for sharing of the Cauvery waters but it could not be implemented.
Mr Muthiah wondered why the government was hesitating to notify the scheme and demanded a response from the government. He then led a walkout of his party members from the House.
Mr Vaiko of the MDMK said the BJP government had done injustice to the state by not notifying the scheme and said he had to join the walkout with a ""heavy heart.""
Mr Maran admitted that the issue was a difficult one to resolve and asked why the government was adopting a dilatory attitude. He also led a walkout of his party members. The DMK’s ally, the TMC also followed suit.
Members from Kerala — Mr K. Karunakaran of the Congress and Mr Krishna Das of the CPM — said the Centre should not take any decision on notifying the scheme without involving the state.
It was a similar scene in the Rajya Sabha with the Tamil Nadu members protesting against the Centre’s callous inaction in notifying the scheme to implement the Cauvery Tribunal’s interim award.
The leader of the DMK, Mr Viduthalai Virumbi, AIADMK leader R.Margabandu, Mrs Jayanthi Natarajan of the TMC and their colleagues were up on their feet the moment the Zero Hour began.

The Tribune,1998-07-22 00:00:00,SC gives govt 3 weeks,"The Supreme Court today gave three week's time to the Union Government to iron out differences between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu over the framing of a scheme to implement the interim award of the Cauvery Tribunal and said it was not inclined to grant adjournments beyond August 12.
""Thus far and no further"", a three-Judge Bench headed by Chief Justice Madan Mohan Punchhi told Attorney-General Soli Sorabjee appearing for the Centre when he sought six week's time to resolve the vexed issue of implementation of the June 1991 interim award of the tribunal directing Karnataka to release 205 TMC feet of Cauvery water annually to Tamil Nadu on a weekly basis.
As soon as the proceedings began before the Bench the Judges wanted to know the stand of the Government of India on the issue of framing of a scheme for implementation of the interim award.
Mr Sorabjee submitted before the court that in pursuance of the April 1997 assurance by the government to frame the scheme, discussions had been held at the highest level to achieve implementation of the order in a harmonious way.
""The outcome of these discussions so far has not been successful though the government was hopeful of ironing out the differences and perceptions"", he said.
The Judges repeatedly referred to the apex court order of April 9, 1997, asking the government to frame a scheme for the implementation of the interim award and said the government was bound to do so.
The Attorney-General made it clear that there should not be an impression that the present government wanted to go back on the April 1997 assurance given to the court on framing of the scheme.
""The whole idea is to create a proper atmosphere to ensure that the scheme was implemented in a harmonious way. Enforcement becomes easier when there is acceptability"", Mr Sorabjee said, adding that it was because of the repeated differences over the implementation that the Centre was taking so much time.
Senior counsel for Tamil Nadu K. Parasaran submitted before the court that the controversy centred only around the question of implementation of the April 1997 orders of this court.
Earlier, one of the Judges, Mr Justice K.T. Thomas (who hails from Kerala) dissociated himself from the Bench after Kerala Government counsel P.S. Potti submitted that though the state was not directly concerned over the implementation of the apex court order of April 1997, it was interested in the principles regarding the framing of the scheme.
Initially the court was inclined to adjourn the hearing by a week but after repeated persuasion by the Attorney-General the Judges gave the government three week's time to get back to the court with a final decision.","The Supreme Court grants the Union Government three weeks to resolve disputes between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu regarding the implementation of the Cauvery Tribunal's interim award. Chief Justice Punchhi refuses further adjournments beyond August 12. Attorney-General Sorabjee assures efforts to harmoniously implement the 1991 tribunal directive. The court emphasizes the government's obligation to frame a scheme for implementation, referring to a 1997 order.

According to informed sources, the Union Territory Administration has returned the panel of three IAS officers sent to it by Haryana for possible replacement of Mrs Gupta. The panelists were Mr Hardip Kumar, Mr Roshan Lal and Mrs Surina Rajan.
The sources say the UT Administration has written to the Haryana Government that the post of Inspector-General of Police in Chandigarh has been upgraded from that of the rank of DIG to IG. Therefore, the UT needs an officer of appropriate seniority (preferably in the super time scale) as its Home Secretary, who is the supervisory officer of the Inspector-General of Police.
Though the post of IG has been upgraded, that of the Home Secretary is yet to be upgraded, for which the UT Administration has written to the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).
Mrs Gupta is already in the super time scale and the post of Home Secretary has been upgraded only for her. Since the upgradation of the post is personal to her, no other Haryana officer can hold this post till its upgradation by the MHA.
The UT Administration is believed to have written to the Haryana Government that it would inform the latter when the post of Home Secretary is upgraded by the MHA, meaning thereby that no fresh panel should be sent to the UT till the post of Home Secretary is upgraded.
That the UT Administration is keen to retain Mrs Gupta well beyond her normal tenure was clear when it requested the Haryana Government to accord one-year extension to Mrs Gupta. The State Government had initially agreed to the UT Administration's request and had conveyed its written consent.
However, within a month of its accepting the UT Administration's request the Haryana Government changed its mind for reasons best known to it.

Dhumal, to tender an apology for having ""misled"" people by claiming that grave irregularities were committed while raising loans through commission agents by the previous Congress Government headed by Mr Virbhadra Singh.
The issue was raised through a point of order by Mr Rangila Ram Rao (Cong), who said while outside the House the Chief Minister and other BJP leaders had been claiming that irregularities were committed by the previous government in the payment of commission, but within the House in written reply to a question yesterday Mr Dhumal had made it clear that the commission was paid as per the guidelines of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
The agitated Congress members accused Mr Dhumal and his partymen of having maligned in their election meetings the then Congress Government by accusing it of having committed irregularities in raising these loans.
Mr Virbhadra Singh was not present in the House when the issue was raised.
A senior Congress legislator, Thakur Ram Lal, said Mr Dhumal owed an apology for having levelled ""wrong and baseless"" allegations against the previous government.
He said during the recent assembly elections the BJP leadership tried to create an impression that the then Congress Government was hand in glove with certain commission agents who raised loans for the state. Doubts were sought to be created in the minds of the electorate on the issue of raising of loans so as to erode the credibility of the Congress leadership.
Thakur Ram Lal said the cat was now out of the bag with Mr Dhumal himself admitting in reply to the question that the commission was paid as per the rates fixed by the RBI.
Mr J.B.L. Khachi (Cong) said this was a very serious matter and the BJP leadership could not escape the responsibility of having made irresponsible statements on the issue.
All Congress members were on their feet when the Chief Minister rose to clarify the position. Nothing was audible in the din.
The Congress members shouted that Mr Dhumal was trying to sidetrack the real issue when he said only incomplete information was given in the reply to the yesterday's question which did not come up during question hour. He would have elaborated the real position, had the question come up in the House.
He said Nabard had raised serious objections on the issue of the cooperative bank having raised a loan of Rs 90 crore for which brokerage was paid during the Congress regime.
Mr Dhumal reiterated that the government would come out with a White Paper in which financial irregularities of the Virbhadra Singh government would be listed.
He said he would give a detailed statement on the issue in the House today itself. However, the matter may come up in the House tomorrow.
Other Congress legislators joined Thakur Ram Lal in saying that the Chief Minister's reply to the yesterday's question was exhaustive as details of all loans raised during the four year rule of the Virbhadra Singh government were mentioned in the reply. They alleged that the Chief Minister was now trying to wriggle out of the situation which has been created due to his reply.
Mr Dhumal made it clear that he had an open mind on the entire issue and the truth would come out in the White Paper. He said not all aspects were touched in reply to the yesterday's question. The White Paper would give details of the loans which were raised through the HPSEB, the Forest Corporation and other institutions on commission basis for the previous government.
Not satisfied with this, the Congress members walked out of the House.
Mr J.P. Nadda, Parliamentary Affairs Minister, said the walkout by the Congress members despite the Chief Minister's announcement that he would give a statement on the issue was condemnable. The Congress members were trying to divert the real issue, he added.
Later, addressing newsmen in the Opposition lounge, Thakur Ram Lal, Mr J.B.L. Khachi, Mrs Vidya Stokes and Mr Kaul Singh claimed that the Chief Minister's reply to the yesterday's question has vindicated the position of the Congress.
They did not agree with the Chief Minister that the reply was incomplete. These legislators pointed out that rule 55 of the Rules and Procedures for conduct of business of the House lays down that ""answers given in the House should be complete and as far as possible, each part there of shall be answered separately"".
They said Mr Dhumal should own or disown the reply to the question.
They said that any statement of the Chief Minister on the issue would be irrelevant now as he had already said in his reply that the payment of commission was as per the guidelines of the RBI.
On the other hand, Mr Dhumal told newsmen that there was non question of his seeking an apology. He would come out with facts on the issue, he added.","Amidst uproar, Himachal Pradesh Congress staged a walkout from the Vidhan Sabha after Chief Minister P.K. Dhumal refused to apologize for alleging grave irregularities in loans raised by the previous Congress government. Congress accused Dhumal of misleading people with baseless claims, citing his contradiction within the House regarding loan commissions. Dhumal promised a White Paper on financial irregularities under the former regime. Congress legislators insisted Dhumal's reply was complete, challenging his attempt to retract. Despite Dhumal's pledge to address the issue, Congress walked out, prompting condemnation from Parliamentary Affairs Minister J.P. Nadda. Both parties stood firm on their positions.",Politics,99,838
The Tribune,1998-07-22 00:00:00,SC gives govt 3 weeks Final reprieve to settle Cauvery row,"The Supreme Court today gave three week's time to the Union Government to iron out differences between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu over the framing of a scheme to implement the interim award of the Cauvery Tribunal and said it was not inclined to grant adjournments beyond August 12.
""Thus far and no further"", a three-Judge Bench headed by Chief Justice Madan Mohan Punchhi told Attorney-General Soli Sorabjee appearing for the Centre when he sought six week's time to resolve the vexed issue of implementation of the June 1991 interim award of the tribunal directing Karnataka to release 205 TMC feet of Cauvery water annually to Tamil Nadu on a weekly basis.
As soon as the proceedings began before the Bench the Judges wanted to know the stand of the Government of India on the issue of framing of a scheme for implementation of the interim award.
Mr Sorabjee submitted before the court that in pursuance of the April 1997 assurance by the government to frame the scheme, discussions had been held at the highest level to achieve implementation of the order in a harmonious way.
""The outcome of these discussions so far has not been successful though the government was hopeful of ironing out the differences and perceptions"", he said.
The Judges repeatedly referred to the apex court order of April 9, 1997, asking the government to frame a scheme for the implementation of the interim award and said the government was bound to do so.
The Attorney-General made it clear that there should not be an impression that the present government wanted to go back on the April 1997 assurance given to the court on framing of the scheme.
""The whole idea is to create a proper atmosphere to ensure that the scheme was implemented in a harmonious way. Enforcement becomes easier when there is acceptability"", Mr Sorabjee said, adding that it was because of the repeated differences over the implementation that the Centre was taking so much time.
Senior counsel for Tamil Nadu K. Parasaran submitted before the court that the controversy centred only around the question of implementation of the April 1997 orders of this court.
Earlier, one of the Judges, Mr Justice K.T. Thomas (who hails from Kerala) dissociated himself from the Bench after Kerala Government counsel P.S.

The Hindu,1998-07-23 00:00:00,Jaya accuses BJP of opportunism,"The AIADMK supremo, Ms Jayalalitha, today charged the BJP with rank political opportunism in delaying a decision on the Cauvery waters dispute. She demanded early notification on interim award for the supply of water to Tamil Nadu but stopped short of repeating or enlarging her warning of ""dangerous consequences.
Accusing the Vajpayee government of having ""resorted to the undesirable strategy of delaying the notification"" by seeking an adjournment of the Supreme Court hearing yesterday, she demanded issuance of the notification on the interim tribunal award even before the August 12 deadline set by the apex court for the Centre to devise a suitable scheme.
Earlier, she had warned the Centre of dangerous consequences if the matter was delayed by seeking further adjournment in the apex court.
In a hard-hitting statement, AIADMK leader also charged the BJP leadership with being reluctant to take any decision that might ""upset voters of Karnataka"" where the alliance leader at the Centre had a bright chance of winning the coming assembly elections.
She asked if the BJP leadership was going to take administrative decisions ""only on narrow, selfish political"" considerations and said it amounted to violation of the central coalition’s national agenda for governance, which included an early settlement of the Cauvery water dispute.
BANGALORE: The Karnataka Government has decided to adopt a two-pronged strategy on the Cauvery waters dispute with Tamil Nadu by pleading with the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal to pronounce the final verdict and with the Centre to finalise guidelines for national river water policy.
Karnataka Major Irrigation Minister K.N. Nage Gowda told reporters here the state was ""seriously thinking"" of filing an application before the tribunal pleading for final award.
He said the state was prepared to accept hearing by the tribunal on a daily basis.
Karnataka in the meanwhile wanted the Centre to fulfil its assurance of formulating and adopting the national river water policy guidelines by convening a meeting of the Inter-state Water Council, of which the Chief Ministers of all states are members, he said.
Karnataka hoped that evolving such a policy guideline would help find a solution to the vexed Cauvery water sharing tangle, Mr Gowda said.
He said the Centre had in 1996 convened a meeting of the Chief Ministers of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Pondicherry and the then Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, assured to finalise national river water policy guidelines.
Mr Rao had even initiated a step to evolve guidelines by convening a meeting of the Inter-state Water Council during February 1996, Mr Gowda said and added later no effort was made in this direction.
Mr Gowda said while the Bacchawat Tribunal which adjudicated the Krishna water sharing dispute completed its task in about six years, the Cauvery tribunal had only given an interim award in about seven years of its existence.
Official sources said in a letter written by Mr Narasimha Rao to the then chief minister, Mr H.D. Deve Gowda, on January 1, 1996, Mr Nage Gowda had stated that formulation of guidelines was the only viable process by which complications such as those faced on inter-state river sharing disputes could be obviated to a larger extent, making way for smoother working of the water sharing mechanism and strengthening a sense of national integration through river systems.","AIADMK leader Jayalalitha criticized the BJP for delaying the Cauvery waters dispute resolution, accusing them of political opportunism.

The Tribune,1998-07-23 00:00:00,Daylight murder in city,"CHANDIGARH, July 23 — In yet another daylight murder, a property dealer of Sector 21 was shot dead by some unknown car-borne assailants in the city here this morning. A property dispute is stated to be the cause of the incident.
The main eyewitness to the murder was 12-year-old Preeti, daughter of the deceased, Baljinder Singh 'Rocky', who was riding pillion on her way to the Sector 9 Carmel Convent School at about 7.30 am.
According to the police, Preeti noticed a white Esteem car following them. She told her father. He ignored her observation even when she told him that the driver of the car had tried to hit them.
They had barely come 200 metres from their house when the car slammed into the scooter, knocking them down in front of house number 1019. As they tried to get up, a person came out of the car and fired at her father hitting him in the head and other parts of the body.
One bullet pierced his helmet. Five shots were fired. Then the car sped away.
The police said the needle of suspicion at this stage pointed towards Balwinder Singh Brar landlord of the house, who had threatened the deceased to vacate the house on many occasions. Mr Brar is the grandson of a former MP from Punjab, Mr NP Brar, and hails from Muktsar.
A police party sent by the local police to Mr Brar's residence in Sector 2 of Panchkula recovered two weapons. But it is yet to be ascertained whether any of the weapons was used in the crime. The police recovered two empties from the spot.
Incidentally the accused and the deceased are both history sheeters with cases registered against them under various sections of the IPC. The ""specialty"" of both was getting disputed properties vacated after occupying and selling them later on large profits.
The father of the deceased, Mr Mahima Singh, said the landlord had on many occasions threatened them and asked them to vacate the house. ""We have been living here for the past 28 years without any problem until the house was bought by Mr Brar.""
Another tenant in the house, Mr Gurinder Singh, who runs a dairy, said the accused had on Tuesday night come with armed persons and had again repeated his threat of liquidating anyone who came in his way.
While he denied reporting the matter to the police, the family members of Rocky said their lawyer had written to the IGP and the SSP regarding the threat to their life on August 16, 1997. A case concerning the property was pending in a city court, they added.
The police was told that the car in which the accused came on Tuesday bore the number PB 33 0001, while the number of the car used in the shootout had a Delhi registration number, DL 6 C B 6989 or 6939. Both were white Esteem cars and the police believes that the numbers were ""probably fake"".
The wife of the victim, Mrs Uma, said she was unaware of any enmity or rivalry of her husband with anyone. He leaves four children, including Preeti, and a two-and-half-month old daughter, Rubika.
The first case registered against the deceased was in 1976. He was booked under the NDPS Act. Subsequently, he was booked under various Sections of the IPC in 1993 (armed robbery), 1996 (two cases of assault) and another case of the same nature in July this year.
Mr Brar on the other hand was booked under Sections 360 and 34, IPC.
He was the second buyer of the property after the earlier owners, S.M. Khan, Jaspal Singh and a Mr Puncchi, could not get it vacated from Rocky.
Rocky was stated to be in illegal possession of another house in the same sector.
A case has been registered in Sector 19 police station for murder and under the arms act.
As the news of the shootout spread, people of the area could be seen discussing the incident while the police cordoned of the area. Senior police officers, including the SSP, Mr C.S.R. Reddy, visited the scene and issued the necessary instructions.
The white scooter of the deceased lay overturned. His broken helmet and a pair of slippers could be seen. A couple of empty cartridges were recovered from the spot.
Residents in the locality were highly critical of the deteriorating law and order situation in the city. It seemed the once peaceful city was going the Bihar and UP way, a resident commented.
The Property Consultants' Association has condemned the cold-blooded murder of Balwinder Singh. Mr Satbir Singh, general secretary of the association, said they would close their shops tomorrow in protest against the killing.
They demanded action against the guilty and write a letter to the Home Secretary and the IGP.
This is the fourth shootout incident in the city in one and a half months.
While Aman Kumar, a nephew of a Haryana MLA was involved in the shootout in a cinema hall where a gatekeeper was injured, a shootout took place in the city courts where fire was exchanged for quite some time between two parties.
Another shootout concerns Manoj Godara in which an SAS Nagar resident was killed in the Sector 10 market.
Meanwhile, the daughter of the deceased is assisting the police in making a sketch of the assailant on computers at the police HQ.","**Daylight Murder in Chandigarh Amidst Property Dispute:**

During the official level talks with the visiting us delegation led by Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, Pakistan also opposed any move by the international community to unilaterally grant nuclear status to India.
Mr Talbott met Pakistan Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan today on the second day of talks, which is believed to have focused on Islamabad signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
During the talks, the Foreign Minister expressed ""Pakistan’s desire to have meaningful dialogue with India to reduce tension and resolution of the Kashmir issue,"" a Pakistani official statement said.
Mr Khan also stressed the need for ""preserving peace and security in south Asia,"" the statement added.
Immediately after his arrival yesterday, Mr Talbott had held more than three hours of ""comprehensive and in-depth"" talks with Pakistani officials led by Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed on the non-proliferation issue.
""The discussion focused on post-nuclear test environment in south Asia,"" a Foreign Ministry statement had said last night.
The US side reportedly pressed Pakistan to sign the CTBT and Islamabad in turn demanded lifting of the sanctions imposed by Washington.
The Pakistani media, meanwhile, claimed that Islamabad had expressed its concern over reports emanating from New Delhi after Mr Talbott’s discussions with Indian authorities that India had demanded its recognition as a nuclear power state.
Though Islamabad has shown its flexibility on the signing of the CTBT it has expressed its apprehension that unilateral granting of nuclear status to India by the international community, in any form, will have serious security repercussions for Pakistan.
The possibility of implicit recognition of India as a nuclear weapon state is a major concern for Pakistan and the main reason for its reluctance to sign the CTBT, the report said.
""There was no possibility that Pakistan would settle for anything less than what is awarded to India,’’ 'The Nation’ quoted a senior official in the wake of reports that India had offered to sign the CTBT and the NTP if it is granted nuclear power status.

The respondents are the state of Punjab through the Chief Secretary, Financial Commissioner (forests), the Forest Minister; and Mr Aulakh.
The Bench ordered the government to file a reply three days in advance of the date fixed and also summoned the original records from the government.

The Tribune,1998-07-23 00:00:00,Punjab farmers sow uncertified seed,"Farmers of Punjab have sown uncertified seed of cotton due to acute shortage of the certified seed in an about two lakh hectare area in the cotton belt of the state.
Agriculture Department sources said out of a total area of 6.25 lakh hectare under the cotton crop in the current season the certified seed was sown in an about four lakh hectare area. In the rest of the area, the farmers had sown uncertified seed.
Sources further said against the total requirement of 50,000 quintals of certified seed of cotton the Agriculture Department could give only 9,800 quintals of certified seed to the farmers in this kharif season. About 30,000 quintals of truthfully labelled (TL) cotton seed was given to the farmers.
Sources said the cotton crop might face high infestation of American bollworm in places where the uncertified seed had been sown. From certain pockets of the cotton belt comprising Bathinda, Mansa, Muktsar, Faridkot, Moga, Sangrur and Ferozepore districts of Punjab reports of bollworm attack had started pouring in.
Sources said in this season the Punjab State Seed Corporation (Punseed) had sold only 4,000 quintals of certified seed on open general sale counter, to the farmers. The required quantity of certified seed could not be produced by Punseed due to repeated crop failure in the past five years.
In the absence of certified seed supply from the state government agencies the farmers depended on the private traders and had sown the seed supplied by the private traders which was very expensive. The state government agencies did not keep a check on the sale of unmatured seed by the private traders to the farmers.
Cotton experts fear cotton output may be poor this season due to various factors. They say first of all farmers could not get certified seed. Then the market is flooded with spurious pesticides which are being used by farmers to save the crop from pest attack. Thirdly, the area under cotton crop has been reduced by 25 per cent as compared to the area under cotton crop last year.
They say the state government agencies did not check the sowing of uncertified seed even though it was being done in violation of the recommendations of the cotton expert committee set up by the state Agriculture Department. Moreover, the cotton plants germinated from the uncertified seed are very much prone to pest attack.
Apart from this, the cotton expert committee recommended the F-846, F-1378, LH-1556 and F-1054 varieties of cotton to the farmers for sowing in the current kharif season but the availability of these varieties was very less in the market and the farmers had to grow the pest-prone varieties.
Dr A.S. Randhawa, Director, Agriculture, Punjab, when contacted at Chandigarh said the department had taken certain steps to save the cotton crop from pest attack. He said teams of experts had been constituted to educate the farmers about the application of insecticides for checking the attack by American bollworm.
He said Rs 20 crore had been given to Punseed for preparing certified seed in large quantity to meet the demands of farmers next year. He said the Agriculture Department would also procure good quality seed of cotton from other agencies also.
However, Punseed sources said the department had planned to produce about 18,000 quintals of certified seed next year. The department had also planned not to import seed cotton from foreign countries.
Dr Randhawa said to increase the cotton output in Punjab 11 villages of Lambi block had been selected under the cotton development project. In these villages, the cotton crop was being grown according to the latest techniques. Integrated pest management had also been adopted in these villages. He said if these villages produced good results then this method would be applied throughout the cotton belt in the state. Mr F.C. Sharma, vice-president of the Northern India Cotton Association, while talking to TNS said the production of cotton crop might to go down as compared to last year if the authorities concerned did not take timely measures. He said the Agriculture Department should ensure the availability of pure pesticides in the market to the farmers and educate them regarding right application.
He said the problem of shortage of certified seed could be solved in future if the government started preparing its own seed from the best quality of cotton after procuring it through its own agencies. He said the Rajasthan Government had adopted the same method and was now supplying more than 75 per cent of the total requirement of seed to the farmers.","Farmers in Punjab face a severe shortage of certified cotton seed, leading to the sowing of uncertified seed across nearly two lakh hectares. The Agriculture Department supplied only a fraction of the required certified seed, with private traders exploiting the gap. Experts fear poor crop output due to factors like spurious pesticides, reduced cotton acreage, and the vulnerability of uncertified seed to pest attacks. Steps are being taken to mitigate the situation, including educating farmers on pest management and increasing certified seed production. However, challenges persist, highlighting the need for comprehensive government intervention and farmer awareness.",Local News,96,760

 He hoped that Indo-Pak relations would improve after his talks with his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif in Colombo on the sidelines of the SAARC summit this month-end.
 ""I hope this would improve Indo-Pak relations and help in resuming the stalled (official level) dialogue between the two countries,"" Mr Vajpayee said.
 Replying to a question by Mr T.

 Soon after conducting the nuclear test, India had declared a moratorium on further tests and announced it was prepared to adhere to some provisions of the CTBT but this could not be done in a vacuum, she said.
 Referring to China’s missile technology supply to Pakistan, Ms Vasundhra Raje said New Delhi wanted Beijing to be more transparent in its dealing with Islamabad.

The Tribune,1998-07-23 00:00:00,LS passes power amend Bill,"The Lok Sabha today passed the Electricity Laws (Amendment) Bill which provides for private investment in power transmission, with the government assuring that the move did not mean privatisation of transmission.
Replying to the debate on the Bill, the Union Power Minister, Mr R Kumaramangalam, allayed apprehensions of members stating that it did not privatise transmission.
""We only want to facilitate private investment for providing facilities in the transmission sector. But real operations will be under the government and its agencies,"" he said.
The Bill which was moved this week in the Lok Sabha seeks to provide for transmission as a distinct activity under the Indian Electricity Act, 1910 and the Electric (Supply) Act, 1948, and to empower the central government or the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) to grant transmission licence in the case of inter-state transmission of energy.
Licence could also be granted by state governments or the State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) for intra-state transmission.
Mr Kumaramangalam also announced the constitution of the CERC and said a notification to this effect would be made soon. He informed the House that at least 12 states had come forward and applied the Regulatory Act.
""We hope we will be able to meet by 2007 the objective of ensuring that India is a modern nation where power is not a liability,"" he said.
Referring to demands by Mr K.D. Sultanpuri (Congress) about projects for Himachal Pradesh, Mr Kumaramangalam said that any new power project, the state gets 12 per cent share of free power which was, indirectly generation tax.
Of the problem of the Bhakra-Beas Management Board, he said a meeting of the Chief Ministers of Northern states had been convened during August second week to discuss it.
Mr Kumaramangalam said he was hopeful that by 2002, the Tehri Dam would start generating power. He would visit the area to discuss the problem of rehabilitation of people affected by the construction of the dam.
Earlier, participating in the debate, the SAD MP, Mr Prem Singh Chandumajra, stressed upon the need to complete ongoing projects and said according to his information there were over 100 such incomplete projects.
Citing an instance, he said, when the Thein Dam project began it was estimated to cost Rs 85 crore and till now Rs 3,000 crore has been spent.
""We are soon going to celebrate the silver jubilee of the project,"" he said adding that even now the project needed an additional Rs 168 crore for completion.
Mr Chandumajra also lamented that Punjab had been excluded from various projects in Himachal Pradesh like the Parvati Dam, Pong Dam and the Nathpa-Jakhri Project despite being a neighbouring state.
He also stressed on the need of fully utilising the plant load factor. At present if the generation capacity in the country of power plants was 84,000 MW, only half of it was being produced.
Mr Sultanpuri (Congress) wanted the Centre to help Himachal Pradesh which, he said, had to collect Rs 12,000 crore dues from various states for supplying power.
He also countered the SAD MP’s suggestion that when Himachal Pradesh gets 12 per cent free power, why should it be allowed generation tax.
Prof Saifuddin Soz (National Conference) suggested that transmission lines should be underground and said the punishment clause be enhanced to act as a deterrent.
Professor Soz also mentioned that the Kashmir valley had not benefited from the Salal Project since there was no transmission line. However, the Minister later informed the House that the link line project was on.","The Lok Sabha passed the Electricity Laws (Amendment) Bill, allowing private investment in power transmission without privatization. Union Power Minister R. Kumaramangalam clarified that private investment would facilitate transmission facilities, but operations remain under the government. The Bill delineates transmission as a distinct activity and empowers the central or state governments to grant transmission licenses. Kumaramangalam announced the constitution of the CERC and addressed concerns regarding ongoing projects and state-specific issues. Members emphasized completing projects, utilization of power plant capacity, and regional concerns like Himachal Pradesh's dues and underground transmission lines. Kumaramangalam assured steps for project completion and addressed concerns raised during the debate.",Politics,104,587

 	Jaya accuses BJP of opportunism
CHENNAI, July 22 (PTI) — The AIADMK supremo, Ms Jayalalitha, today charged the BJP with rank political opportunism in delaying a decision on the Cauvery waters dispute. She demanded early notification on interim award for the supply of water to Tamil Nadu but stopped short of repeating or enlarging her warning of ""dangerous consequences.
Accusing the Vajpayee government of having ""resorted to the undesirable strategy of delaying the notification"" by seeking an adjournment of the Supreme Court hearing yesterday, she demanded issuance of the notification on the interim tribunal award even before the August 12 deadline set by the apex court for the Centre to devise a suitable scheme.
Earlier, she had warned the Centre of dangerous consequences if the matter was delayed by seeking further adjournment in the apex court.
In a hard-hitting statement, AIADMK leader also charged the BJP leadership with being reluctant to take any decision that might ""upset voters of Karnataka"" where the alliance leader at the Centre had a bright chance of winning the coming assembly elections.
She asked if the BJP leadership was going to take administrative decisions ""only on narrow, selfish political"" considerations and said it amounted to violation of the central coalition’s national agenda for governance, which included an early settlement of the Cauvery water dispute.
BANGALORE: The Karnataka Government has decided to adopt a two-pronged strategy on the Cauvery waters dispute with Tamil Nadu by pleading with the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal to pronounce the final verdict and with the Centre to finalise guidelines for national river water policy.
Karnataka Major Irrigation Minister K.N. Nage Gowda told reporters here the state was ""seriously thinking"" of filing an application before the tribunal pleading for final award.
He said the state was prepared to accept hearing by the tribunal on a daily basis.
Karnataka in the meanwhile wanted the Centre to fulfil its assurance of formulating and adopting the national river water policy guidelines by convening a meeting of the Inter-state Water Council, of which the Chief Ministers of all states are members, he said.
Karnataka hoped that evolving such a policy guideline would help find a solution to the vexed Cauvery water sharing tangle, Mr Gowda said.
He said the Centre had in 1996 convened a meeting of the Chief Ministers of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Pondicherry and the then Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, assured to finalise national river water policy guidelines.
Mr Rao had even initiated a step to evolve guidelines by convening a meeting of the Inter-state Water Council during February 1996, Mr Gowda said and added later no effort was made in this direction.
Mr Gowda said while the Bacchawat Tribunal which adjudicated the Krishna water sharing dispute completed its task in about six years, the Cauvery tribunal had only given an interim award in about seven years of its existence.
Official sources said in a letter written by Mr Narasimha Rao to the then chief minister, Mr H.D. Deve Gowda, on January 1, 1996, Mr Nage Gowda had stated that formulation of guidelines was the only viable process by which complications such as those faced on inter-state river sharing disputes could be obviated to a larger extent, making way for smoother working of the water sharing mechanism and strengthening a sense of national integration through river systems.
 	Pakistan for meaningful talks with India
ISLAMABAD, July 22 (PTI) — Pakistan today told the USA that it was ready to have a ""meaningful dialogue"" with India to resolve the Kashmir issue and also to reduce tension in south Asia.
During the official level talks with the visiting us delegation led by Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, Pakistan also opposed any move by the international community to unilaterally grant nuclear status to India.
Mr Talbott met Pakistan Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan today on the second day of talks, which is believed to have focused on Islamabad signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
During the talks, the Foreign Minister expressed ""Pakistan’s desire to have meaningful dialogue with India to reduce tension and resolution of the Kashmir issue,"" a Pakistani official statement said.
Mr Khan also stressed the need for ""preserving peace and security in south Asia,"" the statement added.
Immediately after his arrival yesterday, Mr Talbott had held more than three hours of ""comprehensive and in-depth"" talks with Pakistani officials led by Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed on the non-proliferation issue.
""The discussion focused on post-nuclear test environment in south Asia,"" a Foreign Ministry statement had said last night.
The US side reportedly pressed Pakistan to sign the CTBT and Islamabad in turn demanded lifting of the sanctions imposed by Washington.
The Pakistani media, meanwhile, claimed that Islamabad had expressed its concern over reports emanating from New Delhi after Mr Talbott’s discussions with Indian authorities that India had demanded its recognition as a nuclear power state.
Though Islamabad has shown its flexibility on the signing of the CTBT it has expressed its apprehension that unilateral granting of nuclear status to India by the international community, in any form, will have serious security repercussions for Pakistan.
The possibility of implicit recognition of India as a nuclear weapon state is a major concern for Pakistan and the main reason for its reluctance to sign the CTBT, the report said.
""There was no possibility that Pakistan would settle for anything less than what is awarded to India,’’ 'The Nation’ quoted a senior official in the wake of reports that India had offered to sign the CTBT and the NTP if it is granted nuclear power status.
Mr Talbott today also called on Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and reportedly delivered a message of President Bill Clinton.
The Deputy Secretary of State is expected to wind up his negotiations with a last round of talks with Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed and other Pakistani officials

Forest officers move HC against PCCF
By P.P.S. Gill
Tribune News Service
CHANDIGARH, July 22 — The Punjab State Forest Officers Coordination Committee, an umbrella organisation of Forest Department employees, today filed a writ petition in the Punjab and Haryana High Court seeking an inquiry against Mr K.S. Aulakh, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and his removal from the post pending inquiry.
The petition came up before a Division Bench comprising Mr Justice V.K. Bali and Mr Justice B. Rai, which after hearing arguments issued a notice of motion to the state of Punjab for August 10. The respondents are the state of Punjab through the Chief Secretary, Financial Commissioner (forests), the Forest Minister; and Mr Aulakh.
The Bench ordered the government to file a reply three days in advance of the date fixed and also summoned the original records from the government.
In the petition, the petitioner has sought an inquiry into the ""misdemeanors, malpractices, irregularities, illegalities and corrupt practices"" committed by the PCCF. It has also sought a direction to the state of Punjab to take action and institute high level enquiries on detailed complaints of the petitioners made in the past and also nullify the ""illegal promotion"" of the PCCF on May 20, 1997.
The petitioners also prayed for reopening the inquiry by the Vigilance Department ""into the disproportionate assets"" acquired by the PCCF.
The petitioners contended that Mr Aulakh was tried at various posts but repeatedly found unfit on account of his ""misconduct, quarrelsome nature and selfish ways"". He had to be transferred as many as 17 times during the last 13 years as evident from his service records. They appended a detailed statement with the petition.
It was also contended that the PCCF was promoted without drawing up a panel or departmental promotion committee being convened or held for consideration for promotion to the top post in the Forest Department hierarchy in May, 1997.
The petitioner-union listed as many as 17 separate and distinct allegations relating to undue harassment of officers and subordinate staff by the PCCF.
 	Punjab farmers sow uncertified seed
From Chander Parkash
Tribune News Service
BATHINDA, July 22 — Farmers of Punjab have sown uncertified seed of cotton due to acute shortage of the certified seed in an about two lakh hectare area in the cotton belt of the state.
Agriculture Department sources said out of a total area of 6.25 lakh hectare under the cotton crop in the current season the certified seed was sown in an about four lakh hectare area. In the rest of the area, the farmers had sown uncertified seed.
Sources further said against the total requirement of 50,000 quintals of certified seed of cotton the Agriculture Department could give only 9,800 quintals of certified seed to the farmers in this kharif season. About 30,000 quintals of truthfully labelled (TL) cotton seed was given to the farmers.
Sources said the cotton crop might face high infestation of American bollworm in places where the uncertified seed had been sown. From certain pockets of the cotton belt comprising Bathinda, Mansa, Muktsar, Faridkot, Moga, Sangrur and Ferozepore districts of Punjab reports of bollworm attack had started pouring in.
Sources said in this season the Punjab State Seed Corporation (Punseed) had sold only 4,000 quintals of certified seed on open general sale counter, to the farmers. The required quantity of certified seed could not be produced by Punseed due to repeated crop failure in the past five years.
In the absence of certified seed supply from the state government agencies the farmers depended on the private traders and had sown the seed supplied by the private traders which was very expensive. The state government agencies did not keep a check on the sale of unmatured seed by the private traders to the farmers.
Cotton experts fear cotton output may be poor this season due to various factors. They say first of all farmers could not get certified seed. Then the market is flooded with spurious pesticides which are being used by farmers to save the crop from pest attack. Thirdly, the area under cotton crop has been reduced by 25 per cent as compared to the area under cotton crop last year.
They say the state government agencies did not check the sowing of uncertified seed even though it was being done in violation of the recommendations of the cotton expert committee set up by the state Agriculture Department. Moreover, the cotton plants germinated from the uncertified seed are very much prone to pest attack.
Apart from this, the cotton expert committee recommended the F-846, F-1378, LH-1556 and F-1054 varieties of cotton to the farmers for sowing in the current kharif season but the availability of these varieties was very less in the market and the farmers had to grow the pest-prone varieties.
Dr A.S. Randhawa, Director, Agriculture, Punjab, when contacted at Chandigarh said the department had taken certain steps to save the cotton crop from pest attack. He said teams of experts had been constituted to educate the farmers about the application of insecticides for checking the attack by American bollworm.
He said Rs 20 crore had been given to Punseed for preparing certified seed in large quantity to meet the demands of farmers next year. He said the Agriculture Department would also procure good quality seed of cotton from other agencies also.
However, Punseed sources said the department had planned to produce about 18,000 quintals of certified seed next year. The department had also planned not to import seed cotton from foreign countries.
Dr Randhawa said to increase the cotton output in Punjab 11 villages of Lambi block had been selected under the cotton development project. In these villages, the cotton crop was being grown according to the latest techniques. Integrated pest management had also been adopted in these villages. He said if these villages produced good results then this method would be applied throughout the cotton belt in the state. Mr F.C. Sharma, vice-president of the Northern India Cotton Association, while talking to TNS said the production of cotton crop might to go down as compared to last year if the authorities concerned did not take timely measures. He said the Agriculture Department should ensure the availability of pure pesticides in the market to the farmers and educate them regarding right application.

The tribune,1998-07-24 00:00:00,Daylight murder in city,"In yet another daylight murder, a property dealer of Sector 21 was shot dead by some unknown car-borne assailants in the city here this morning. A property dispute is stated to be the cause of the incident.
The main eyewitness to the murder was 12-year-old Preeti, daughter of the deceased, Baljinder Singh 'Rocky', who was riding pillion on her way to the Sector 9 Carmel Convent School at about 7.30 am.
According to the police, Preeti noticed a white Esteem car following them. She told her father. He ignored her observation even when she told him that the driver of the car had tried to hit them.
They had barely come 200 metres from their house when the car slammed into the scooter, knocking them down in front of house number 1019. As they tried to get up, a person came out of the car and fired at her father hitting him in the head and other parts of the body.
One bullet pierced his helmet. Five shots were fired. Then the car sped away.
The police said the needle of suspicion at this stage pointed towards Balwinder Singh Brar landlord of the house, who had threatened the deceased to vacate the house on many occasions. Mr Brar is the grandson of a former MP from Punjab, Mr NP Brar, and hails from Muktsar.
A police party sent by the local police to Mr Brar's residence in Sector 2 of Panchkula recovered two weapons. But it is yet to be ascertained whether any of the weapons was used in the crime. The police recovered two empties from the spot.
Incidentally the accused and the deceased are both history sheeters with cases registered against them under various sections of the IPC. The ""specialty"" of both was getting disputed properties vacated after occupying and selling them later on large profits.
The father of the deceased, Mr Mahima Singh, said the landlord had on many occasions threatened them and asked them to vacate the house. ""We have been living here for the past 28 years without any problem until the house was bought by Mr Brar.""
Another tenant in the house, Mr Gurinder Singh, who runs a dairy, said the accused had on Tuesday night come with armed persons and had again repeated his threat of liquidating anyone who came in his way.
While he denied reporting the matter to the police, the family members of Rocky said their lawyer had written to the IGP and the SSP regarding the threat to their life on August 16, 1997. A case concerning the property was pending in a city court, they added.
The police was told that the car in which the accused came on Tuesday bore the number PB 33 0001, while the number of the car used in the shootout had a Delhi registration number, DL 6 C B 6989 or 6939. Both were white Esteem cars and the police believes that the numbers were ""probably fake"".
The wife of the victim, Mrs Uma, said she was unaware of any enmity or rivalry of her husband with anyone. He leaves four children, including Preeti, and a two-and-half-month old daughter, Rubika.
The first case registered against the deceased was in 1976. He was booked under the NDPS Act. Subsequently, he was booked under various Sections of the IPC in 1993 (armed robbery), 1996 (two cases of assault) and another case of the same nature in July this year.
Mr Brar on the other hand was booked under Sections 360 and 34, IPC.
He was the second buyer of the property after the earlier owners, S.M. Khan, Jaspal Singh and a Mr Puncchi, could not get it vacated from Rocky.
Rocky was stated to be in illegal possession of another house in the same sector.
A case has been registered in Sector 19 police station for murder and under the arms act.
As the news of the shootout spread, people of the area could be seen discussing the incident while the police cordoned of the area. Senior police officers, including the SSP, Mr C.S.R. Reddy, visited the scene and issued the necessary instructions.
The white scooter of the deceased lay overturned. His broken helmet and a pair of slippers could be seen. A couple of empty cartridges were recovered from the spot.
Residents in the locality were highly critical of the deteriorating law and order situation in the city. It seemed the once peaceful city was going the Bihar and UP way, a resident commented.
The Property Consultants' Association has condemned the cold-blooded murder of Balwinder Singh. Mr Satbir Singh, general secretary of the association, said they would close their shops tomorrow in protest against the killing.
They demanded action against the guilty and write a letter to the Home Secretary and the IGP.
This is the fourth shootout incident in the city in one and a half months.
While Aman Kumar, a nephew of a Haryana MLA was involved in the shootout in a cinema hall where a gatekeeper was injured, a shootout took place in the city courts where fire was exchanged for quite some time between two parties.

Contrary to earlier indications that Islamabad might take a line independent of India to sign the treaty, Pakistan Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed today said that his country would not be coerced into signing the CTBT in disregard to its vital security interests.
Speaking to reporters at the end of three-day talks with visiting US Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, he said there has to be a ""clear demonstration of effective engagement"" on part of major powers in the whole process of peace and security in South Asia ""which must focus on Kashmir.""
Asked about the opposition by Pakistan to sign the CTBT, Mr Talbott said this was one of the main issues that ""we have worked on last couple of days....Pakistani leadership is to address the concerns and interests of its people.""
Mr Ahmed said, ""The timing of acceding to the treaty (CTBT) can be determined only when we are absolutely sure that our vital security concerns have been fully safeguarded.""
A joint statement described the talks ""substantive and constructive"" and said both sides has agreed to continue their discussions the later part of August.
Mr Talbott, who arrived here after having similar discussions with Indian leaders in New Delhi, said his talks with Pakistani officials focussed on ""very very tough issues.""
He hoped a positive outcome of the forthcoming meeting between Indian and Pakistani Prime Ministers on the sidelines of the SAARC summit in Colombo later this month.
""A direct Pakistani and Indian dialogue has to resume and (we) will be watching and supporting (it) in every way we have,"" he added.
Mr Ahmed said President Bill Clinton in his letter to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif delivered yesterday pointed out that India and Pakistan could resume the dialogue and Washington ""will use its influence for engagement between the two countries on Kashmir.""
The Foreign Secretary said Pakistan would see to what extent India was ready to reciprocate ""our sincerity on the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir"" during the Colombo talks between Atal Behari Vajpayee and Nawaz Sharif.

""We are soon going to celebrate the silver jubilee of the project,"" he said adding that even now the project needed an additional Rs 168 crore for completion.
Mr Chandumajra also lamented that Punjab had been excluded from various projects in Himachal Pradesh like the Parvati Dam, Pong Dam and the Nathpa-Jakhri Project despite being a neighbouring state.
He also stressed on the need of fully utilising the plant load factor. At present if the generation capacity in the country of power plants was 84,000 MW, only half of it was being produced.
Mr Sultanpuri (Congress) wanted the Centre to help Himachal Pradesh which, he said, had to collect Rs 12,000 crore dues from various states for supplying power.
He also countered the SAD MP’s suggestion that when Himachal Pradesh gets 12 per cent free power, why should it be allowed generation tax.

CHANDIGARH, July 23 — In yet another daylight murder, a property dealer of Sector 21 was shot dead by some unknown car-borne assailants in the city here this morning. A property dispute is stated to be the cause of the incident.

One bullet pierced his helmet. Five shots were fired. Then the car sped away.
The police said the needle of suspicion at this stage pointed towards Balwinder Singh Brar landlord of the house, who had threatened the deceased to vacate the house on many occasions. Mr Brar is the grandson of a former MP from Punjab, Mr NP Brar, and hails from Muktsar.
A police party sent by the local police to Mr Brar's residence in Sector 2 of Panchkula recovered two weapons. But it is yet to be ascertained whether any of the weapons was used in the crime. The police recovered two empties from the spot.
Incidentally the accused and the deceased are both history sheeters with cases registered against them under various sections of the IPC. The ""specialty"" of both was getting disputed properties vacated after occupying and selling them later on large profits.
The father of the deceased, Mr Mahima Singh, said the landlord had on many occasions threatened them and asked them to vacate the house. ""We have been living here for the past 28 years without any problem until the house was bought by Mr Brar.""
Another tenant in the house, Mr Gurinder Singh, who runs a dairy, said the accused had on Tuesday night come with armed persons and had again repeated his threat of liquidating anyone who came in his way.
While he denied reporting the matter to the police, the family members of Rocky said their lawyer had written to the IGP and the SSP regarding the threat to their life on August 16, 1997. A case concerning the property was pending in a city court, they added.
The police was told that the car in which the accused came on Tuesday bore the number PB 33 0001, while the number of the car used in the shootout had a Delhi registration number, DL 6 C B 6989 or 6939. Both were white Esteem cars and the police believes that the numbers were ""probably fake"".
The wife of the victim, Mrs Uma, said she was unaware of any enmity or rivalry of her husband with anyone. He leaves four children, including Preeti, and a two-and-half-month old daughter, Rubika.
The first case registered against the deceased was in 1976. He was booked under the NDPS Act. Subsequently, he was booked under various Sections of the IPC in 1993 (armed robbery), 1996 (two cases of assault) and another case of the same nature in July this year.
Mr Brar on the other hand was booked under Sections 360 and 34, IPC.
He was the second buyer of the property after the earlier owners, S.M. Khan, Jaspal Singh and a Mr Puncchi, could not get it vacated from Rocky.
Rocky was stated to be in illegal possession of another house in the same sector.
A case has been registered in Sector 19 police station for murder and under the arms act.
As the news of the shootout spread, people of the area could be seen discussing the incident while the police cordoned of the area. Senior police officers, including the SSP, Mr C.S.R. Reddy, visited the scene and issued the necessary instructions.
The white scooter of the deceased lay overturned. His broken helmet and a pair of slippers could be seen. A couple of empty cartridges were recovered from the spot.
Residents in the locality were highly critical of the deteriorating law and order situation in the city. It seemed the once peaceful city was going the Bihar and UP way, a resident commented.
The Property Consultants' Association has condemned the cold-blooded murder of Balwinder Singh. Mr Satbir Singh, general secretary of the association, said they would close their shops tomorrow in protest against the killing.
They demanded action against the guilty and write a letter to the Home Secretary and the IGP.
This is the fourth shootout incident in the city in one and a half months.
While Aman Kumar, a nephew of a Haryana MLA was involved in the shootout in a cinema hall where a gatekeeper was injured, a shootout took place in the city courts where fire was exchanged for quite some time between two parties.
Another shootout concerns Manoj Godara in which an SAS Nagar resident was killed in the Sector 10 market.
Meanwhile, the daughter of the deceased is assisting the police in making a sketch of the assailant on computers at the police HQ.

 	Youth dies in police custody

BATHINDA, July 23 — Baljit Singh (24), who was allegedly illegally detained in the Maur Mandi police station died under mysterious circumstances at about 4 a.m. last morning.
The police sources said Baljit was picked up from the bus stand of Maur Mandi by Assistant Sub-Inspector, Bhavkhand Singh and two Home Guard jawans on July 21 evening.
Baljit was illegally kept in the police custody and he was allegedly beaten up. Baljit was shifted to a private hospital at Maur Mandi where his condition deteriorated. Later, he was shifted to the Civil Hospital, Maur Mandi.
The father of deceased Baljit Singh, Mr Nahar Singh, was only informed about the death of his son. He said the police did not inform him about his son's detention.
Mr S.R. Ladhar, District Magistrate, has informed the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) about the custodial death.
Sources said the police was earlier trying to hush up the case by turning it into ""natural death"" but the member of National Council, People Union of Civil Liberties (PUCL), Dr Vineeta Gupta, intervened into the matter and got a case registered according to the instructions of the NHRC.
Mr M.S. Chinna, SP (D), when contacted admitted that Baljit was picked up from the bus stand and kept illegally in the police custody. He said ASI Bhavkhand Singh had been placed under suspension and sent to police lines. A case under Section 302, 342 and 34 of the IPC had been registered in this regard.
He, however, said the case was not registered against any police official by name as the father of deceased could not name any police official who was involved in this case.
On the other hand, Mr Nahar Singh, the father of the deceased, while talking to TNS said as he was not aware of kidnapping of his son by the police, he could not name any police officer in this case. However, the residents of the Burj Maur village, to which deceased belonged, alleged that an FIR was not registered by name by the police to hush up the case.
Mr Ladhar, when contacted said he had also ordered a magisterial inquiry into this case and SDM, Talwandi Sabo, Mrs Kanwal Preet Kaur, would conduct the probe.
Official sources said post-mortem report had shown injury on the right part of skull of the deceased that might have been fatal, according to the panel of doctors, who had conducted the post-mortem about 18 hours after receiving the body.
The post-mortem report had also revealed that ants had eaten up most of the parts of body. However, doctors who conducted the post-mortem said ants did not damage any part that could have affected the post-mortem.
Mr Chinna said the DSP (D) had been asked to conduct a probe for identifying the guilty policemen who were responsible for the death of Baljit Singh. He added all guilty police officials would be punished as per law.
Dr Vineeta Gupta, however, said the police should also explain why the body was shifted to the Civil Hospital 12 hours after the death. She also said the hospital authorities should explain why the ice slabs were not placed with the body for about six hours.
She said she had written to peoples commission about this custodial death. She added a comprehensive report of the custodial death would also be sent to the NHRC by the PUCL.
It may be mentioned here that it is a second custodial death in this region. Earlier, Jaggar Singh of Kot Dune village died under mysterious circumstances in the Dhanaula police station in the Barnala police district on July 15.","The Lok Sabha passed the Electricity Laws (Amendment) Bill, allowing private investment in power transmission without privatizing it.

If a consensus on the name for the Deputy Speaker’s post had been reached among the allies and the BJP, the minister said the Prime Minister had been authorised to decide the candidate.
However, sources said the MP from Dhanbad in Bihar, Mrs Rita Verma, was emerging as one of the front runner for the post among the names which were being seriously considered by Mr Vajpayee. Other names in discussion include former Deputy Speaker, Mr S. Mallikarjunaiah, Chandigarh MP, Mr Satyapal Jain and the Lok Sabha MP from Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh, Dr L.N. Pandey.
Mrs Verma has an edge over the others, as the BJP leadership is said to be of the view that being a woman, she alone would be in a position to effectively counter the argument of the Congress which is projecting Mr P.M. Sayeed,who represents minorities, for the post. Mrs Verma, who has been in the panel of presiding officers of the Lok Sabha, is considered competent to meet the challenge of the post. A minority candidate can be effectively countered by a woman candidate, a BJP leader said.
Mr Mallikarjunaiah had almost lost the race as he hailed from Karnataka and Mr Balayogi was also from a southern state, a BJP senior leader said. At one stage, the name of the former Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister, Mr Shanta Kumar, was also considered but sources said he himself opted out of the race.
Earlier, Mr Khurana said the 15 leaders of the BJP’s allies and alliance partners reiterated their decision to authorise Mr Vajpayee to take a decision. The Trinamool Congress and the Samata Party, who did not attend the meeting today morning, had conveyed their decision in this regard to the Prime Minister. The Trinamool Congress leader, Ms Mamata Banerjee, could not attend the meeting as she was in Calcutta, Mr Khurana said.
Mr Dalip Ray from the Biju Janata Dal, Mr Prem Singh Chandumajra and Mr G.S.Tohra from the Akali Dal, Mr Madhukar Sarpotdar from the Shiv Sena, Mr Dalit Ezhimalai from the PMK, Mr R.Muttiah from the AIADMK, Mr Kishan Singh from the HLD (R), Mr Surinder Singh from the Haryana Vikas Party, Mr K.Ramamurthy from the Rajiv Congress, Mr Yerran Naidu from the Telugu Desam Party, Mr R.K.

 	USA snaps scientific ties
WASHINGTON, July 24 (PTI) — The USA which has asked seven Indian scientists to return home and is contemplating similar action against many more, has ordered suspension of all Department of Energy and National Laboratory-financed interactions with India and Pakistan except for humanitarian assistance.
Even university programmes funded by the Department of Energy may continue dealing with institutions and individuals from the two countries only after approval from the headquarters, according to the direction issued by the Energy Secretary Federico Pena.
The sanctions imposed to deny India any possible scientific aid for its nuclear, missile and military programmes already cover over 60 institutions and departments and more are likely to be added after a review. These also cover two Pakistani entities.
Mr Pena has directed suspension of all activities, including visits involving Indian and Pakistani foreign nationals from nuclear institutes and related bodies as also suspension of all high-level visits from the USA to India and Pakistan besides hosting of high-level delegations from these countries.
A press release from the Energy Department said that exceptions could be made in ""cases of special urgency or merit (for example, some long-standing international collaboration in basic science that benefits the USA.
Support from the Energy Department and national laboratory for research and scholarly activities of Indian and Pakistani nationals from non-sensitive categories including support provided indirectly through US universities may continue till further notice.
The Pena memorandum said the administration was preparing specific guidelines on implementation of the sanctions and any additional actions that might result from such guidelines would be communicated separately.
Meanwhile, a militant non-proliferator, Leonard Spector, who is Director of the office of Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, has been given the charge of providing guidance on specific cases for carrying out these directions.
Scientists' ouster
One Indian scientist has been ""suspended"" and about 10 more may be sent home from the United States Energy Department, while seven scientists are affected in the US National Institute of Standards under the non-proliferation directives following the Indian nuclear explosions, spokespersons of these institutions told PTI.
More such scientists could be affected in other US government institutions or organisations.
There may be more suspensions or expulsions, depending on directives under review by the State Department.
""At the Department of Energy, we have suspended the work of one Indian scientist. We are in the process of reviewing the work in the research of various Indian and Pakistani scientists who are affiliated with organisations on the list (of institutions with which collaboration is to be suspended),"" Department of Energy spokesperson Carmen MacDougall said.
The latest step comes in the backdrop of the USA suspending all Department of Energy and National Laboratory financed interactions with India and Pakistan except for humanitarian assistance.
""We believe at this point only a handful of people will be affected. It means less than 10.""
""However, we are still in the process of reviewing the research. The sanctions are not against people. The sanctions are looking at those organisations on the list,"" MacDougall said.
Michael Newman, spokesman for the National Institute of Standards, said, ""(so far) we have had one researcher who was affiliated with the Bhabha Nuclear Research Centre. He has gone home.
""Another gentleman whose research was being completed this month anyway, is getting ready to go home.""
""There are five others that the State Department has indicated it wants to suspend ties with. They have been asked to leave before the end of August 31. They are with the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research and the Indian Institute of Technology,"" he said.
Action condemned
BANGALORE: Clinton administration’s action in asking seven Indian scientists to leave the USA, in what is seen as a punitive action for India’s nuclear tests, has come under fire from the country’s top scientists who have described it as ""unjustified and unwarranted"".
The scientists, who spoke to PTI, were unanimous in condemning the US move which, it is reported, may also affect 75 Indian scientists working in the American research laboratories on exchange and fellowship programme.
""Scientists have never been treated so badly — not even during the cold war period"", Prof C.N.R. Rao of the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research said.
""I used to go to many conferences in the USA and all were eager to meet scientists from the erstwhile Soviet Union even at the height of cold war. Now, without cold war, this is happening (US action)"", he said.
Mr Rao, who headed a scientific advisory committee to the late Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, said there was no need to be alarmed by the US action, which he described as a ""small aberration"". He, however, said the impact on the country’s science and technology scene would be great if the USA, which had the world’s biggest scientists pool, came up with further measures against Indian scientists.
Commenting on the development, the Director of Indian Institute of Science (IISC), Prof G. Padmanabhan, said the ""US government has become paranoid"".

 	Pandemonium in Haryana Assembly
No-trust motion against Speaker
Tribune News Service
CHANDIGARH, July 24 — Pandemonium prevailed in the Haryana Vidhan Sabha today when the entire Opposition pressed for immediate discussion on its motion to remove the Speaker and the latter insisted that he would deal with the motion in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and the rules of the House.
The trouble started as soon as the Speaker, Prof Chhattar Singh Chauhan, called Mr Bhagi Ram (HLDR) to resume the discussion on the Budget after zero hour.
The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Om Prakash Chautala, said the entire Opposition comprising 36 MLAs (22 of HLDR, 12 of the Congress and two Independents) had submitted a motion for removal of the Speaker who should first take a decision on that before taking up other business of the House.
Mr Chauhan said the motion was submitted at 9.30 a.m. and he would deal with it as per the law. He said under Article 179-C of the Constitution an advance notice of at least 14 days was must.
However, the Opposition wanted Mr Chauhan to follow the precedent set by him in the previous session when he had allowed the motion to be taken up without insisting on the notice period.
For a considerable time the entire Opposition was on its feet saying that since they had no confidence in the Speaker, the motion should be taken up immediately. Soon a verbal clash ensued between Mr Chauhan and the former Leader of the Opposition, Prof Sampat Singh, who was named by the Chair.
However, when the member refused to leave the House the Speaker adjourned it for 10 minutes. A meeting of leaders of various parties with the Speaker was held in his chamber. The adjournment was extended for 20 minutes.
When the House reassembled, leaders of various Opposition parties urged the Speaker to allow Mr Sampat Singh to participate in the proceedings of the House. Certain ruling party members like Mr Karan Singh Dalal, Agriculture Minister, and Mr Attar Singh Saini, Parliamentary Affairs Minister, opposed the Opposition plea. Surprisingly, Mr Ram Bilas Sharma, Education Minister and the Leader of BJP Legislature Party, ignored the Speaker's invitation to speak. Ultimately, the Speaker allowed Mr Sampat Singh to come in the House. The member expressed his gratitude to the Speaker for this gesture.
As the Speaker again called Mr Bhagi Ram to resume the discussion, Mr Sharma stood up and appealed to the Opposition to withdraw its motion to remove the Speaker. Mr Chautala and other Opposition leaders firmly rejected Mr Sharma's appeal.
After again calling Mr Bhagi Ram, Mr Chauhan left the House to the Deputy Speaker, Mr Faqir Chand Aggarwal. However, Mr Chautala said till a decision was taken on their motion, the Opposition would not allow any other business to be conducted. Mr Aggarwal insisted that Mr Chauhan had called a meeting of party leaders in his chamber after the House was adjourned for the day and the discussion on the Budget was to be resumed.","The Lok Sabha Deputy Speaker contest emerges as the Prime Minister, Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee, decides to field a BJP candidate.

In an interview to The Week magazine on the eve of his departure to Colombo and a one-to-one meeting with Mr Sharif, the first between the two Prime Ministers after the nuclear tests, Mr Vajpayee said ""We wish to discuss our differences with Pakistan, including those on Kashmir bilaterally"".
He, however, ruled out a third party mediation on the Kashmir issue. ""We are of the firm view that there is no role for any third party in our bilateral relationships,"" Mr Vajpayee, who is scheduled to meet Mr Sharif in Colombo on July 29 on the sidelines of SAARC summit, said.

""In the aftermath of our nuclear tests, we are also prepared to discuss a no-first-use of nuclear weapons agreement with Pakistan,"" Mr Vajpayee said.
Mr Vajpayee made it clear that India was committed to resolving its differences with Pakistan peacefully and through a process of bilateral dialogue so as to build a stable structure of cooperation.

They have been working at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a US government research centre in Gaithersburg, Maryland, near here, on two semiconductor manufacturing projects and a ceramics processing project, said NIST spokesman Michael Newman.
The State Department has blacklisted these three projects and has put on hold four projects NIST is running in conjunction with its Indian collaborator, National Physical Laboratory, all related to scientific standards.
Mr Newman said the State Department had asked for a list of the projects with which researchers from Indian institutions were associated. The department decided on who should leave the country and conveyed the decision to NIST, which is run by the Commerce Department.
Mr Newman said NIST did not believe the projects had any direct link with India’s nuclear weapons programme.
Apparently, the seven scientists were asked to quit because of the institutions they represented in India. These are Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in Trombay, the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, and the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) both in Mumbai.
The Bhabha Atomic Research Centre and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research are stated to be on the US Government’s blacklist. Some 62 Indian and five Pakistani institutions are stated to be in this category.
In all, some 30 Indian scientists were currently with NIST, Mr Newman said. There was only one from Pakistan. But, since an American university had sponsored him, he would stay.
He said, ""we are doing what we are being asked to do. It is hard on us because we are in the business of promoting science and technology and industrial research, and it’s not normal for us to be doing this kind of thing.""
Mr Newman hoped that the problem that led to this unfortunate development would be sorted out soon and the Indian scientists would return to pick up their work where they left off.
Of the seven, one had already left for home. Another had completed his project and was to return in normal course. The remaining five have been time until August 31, to pack off and go.
According to another report, an Indian scientist from the Bhabha centre has also been asked to leave. He is in Illinois and has been using the intense pulsed neutron source of Argonne National Laboratory.
Later, a State Department official said a review of US relations with India and Pakistan in the field of science and technology had of late been going on, particularly concerning those entities in the two countries which dealt with the nuclear weapons and missile programmes.
The State Department official said the purpose of the review was to ""ensure that we do not have inappropriate cooperation with India or Pakistan.""
He said the exchange programme was very expensive and following the nuclear tests by India and Pakistan, the USA wanted to ensure that these cooperative ventures did not go against the ""grain of our non-proliferation objective.""
Meanwhile, the Department of Energy (doe) has issued a fact-sheet stating that the sanctions which the USA had imposed on India and Pakistan required the suspension of all doe-financed activities with entities in either of the country, except for humanitarian assistance.
All visits by Indians and Pakistanis from the blacklisted institutions must also be suspended, along with high-level visits to India and Pakistan by doe personnel, it added.
Universities with programmes, which receive doe funding, should seek guidance from the department on whether they should continue activities with the institutions, it said.

The parleys assume significance as they come close on the heels of the third round of talks Mr Jaswant Singh had with US Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott in Delhi on July 20 and 21.
Delhi has made it clear that it will not compromise on its security interests and has categorically ruled out any rollback of its nuclear weaponisation programme.

The Tribune,1998-07-27 00:00:00,SAARC draft skirts N-issue,"The draft Colombo declaration of the SAARC summit skirts the explosive nuclear issue, even as it seeks to infuse renewed urgency to economic cooperation among the member states.
Though since its inception, the summit declarations have ritually called for nuclear disarmament and total elimination of nuclear weapons, the Colombo declaration, draft of which was seen by UNI, is silent on the issue.
The atomic tests by India and Pakistan have apparently created a serious dilemma for the officials who drafted the document as to how to address the issue.
But informed sources said the issue would most probably be incorporated in the final declaration, marrying the different perspectives of the member states, particularly the main players, India and Pakistan.
They said the issue would figure not only in the bilateral talks between Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and his Pakistan counterpart Mr Nawaz Sharif, but also during discussions among their talks with the other SAARC leaders.
It will be strange if the known stand of SAARC on disarmament suddenly does not find place in the Colombo declaration, particularly in the background of the atomic tests by India and Pakistan, one source said. The last summit in Male was held months before New Delhi and Pakistan carried out their tests.
The relevant chapter on disarmament in the Male declaration had stated ""noting that the end of the cold war had created unprecedented opportunities in the field of disarmament, the heads of state of government recognised the need for the international community to pursue nuclear disarmament as a matter of highest priority.""
""In this regard, they recognised the need to start negotiations through the conference on disarmament and to establish a phased programme for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons within a specified framework of time, including a nuclear weapons convention.""
In fact, successive SAARC summits have supported the lofty ideal of nuclear disarmament.
Addressing a news conference on Friday, Sri Lanka’s Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar said though the nuclear tests were not on the agenda of the summit, it could figure during the discussions.
""I didn’t say the SAARC summit will avoid the nuclear issue. Whether it would be taken up or not is entirely up to the leaders,"" he said in response to a question.
""The obstacles and opportunities inherent in these fast evolving developments could best be met and the full potential of South Asia realised through effective, practical, regional integration as well as through continued bilateral cooperation among the member states,"" the draft declaration states.
It notes that the benefits of the liberalisation have been disappointingly ""asymmetrical"" with the process proceeding at much slower pace in areas of special interest to developing countries.
It says that the least developed countries have in particular been marginalised through a series of developments, including the shrinking of overseas donor assistance and concern about the erection of protectionist barriers and the tendency to impose arbitrary norms relating to labour conditions, environmental regulations, governance and other extraneous issues to regulate trade exchanges.
These would have the effect of restricting product access for developing countries into the markets of developed countries, it warns.
In this context, the draft declaration calls for collective strategies to promote a rule-based, non-discriminatory and equitable international trading system in which the interests and concerns of the developing countries would not suffer.
On the emerging issues relating to copyright, patents and marketing franchises, including foodgrains, plants and herbs indigenous to South Asia, the declaration calls for ""firm, collective responses"" to preserve the bio resources of the region from unregulated commercial exploitation by extra-regional interests.
According to the draft, the heads of state would see that potential efforts to formulate new multilateral investment agreement do not overlook the need to ensure the continued independence of developing countries to formulate specific investment policies.
In an obvious reference to the financial crisis in South East Asia, the draft declaration expresses concern about the shortcomings of the international monetary and financial system and their tardiness in anticipating impending financial market crises sufficiently in advance so that pre -emptive remedial action could be adopted.
The document also stresses the need to strengthen the individual financial systems of SAARC countries through enhancing institutional capacity, surveillance mechanism as well as through closer consultations on, and coordination of, macro-economic policies.
On the question of Sapta (South Asian Preferential Trade Agreement), the leaders are expected to decide to accelerate the progress in the next round of negotiations by extending deeper preferential tariff concessions to products which are being actively traded among the members.
They would also declare their decision to remove discriminatory practices, non-tariff barriers and structural impediments in trade. This would include items in respect of which tariff concessions have already been granted and rules of origin on the domestic content requirement.
The draft declaration says that the benefits of economic liberalisation would be more extensive and better balanced through the inclusion of trade-creating joint ventures,, investment and trade in-services such as tourism. The draft declaration also calls for strengthening regional cooperation and cultural unity and enhancing political cooperation among the member states. As a practical step towards making South Asia as a single telecommunication territory, the declaration calls for the implementation of the decision by the SAARC Communication Ministers recently to reduce the telecommunication tariffs to the lowest extent possible within the region during 1998.","The draft Colombo declaration of the SAARC summit emphasizes economic cooperation but remains silent on nuclear disarmament, likely to be addressed later. It stresses equitable international trade, protection of bio-resources, and strengthening financial systems amidst concerns over the international monetary system's shortcomings. The declaration aims to accelerate preferential trade agreements, remove trade barriers, and promote joint ventures. It also calls for enhancing regional cooperation, cultural unity, and political cooperation. Practical steps include reducing telecommunication tariffs to foster a single telecommunication territory in South Asia. Nuclear issues may arise in bilateral talks, reflecting SAARC's historical support for disarmament.",International News,97,889
The Tribune,1998-07-27 00:00:00,"N-blasts shadow Vajpayee, Sharif talks","The Sri Lankan capital is preparing to host a summit of the South-Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) under the shadow of the Pokhran and Chagai blasts.
The general provisions enshrined in the SAARC charter, which was adopted on December 8, 1985, in Dhaka, say that ""bilateral and contentious issues are to be excluded from the deliberations"". It is also laid down that ""decisions at all levels are to be taken on the basis of unanimity"".
While the summit itself may not be the occasion for bilateral squabbles, the focus will be on the meeting between Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan at the bilateral level.
Now that SAARC has two nuclear ""haves"" in its midst, the outcome of this meeting will cast a shadow on the summit itself.
From the indications available so far, neither India nor Pakistan are in a position to agree with each other. They can at best agree to disagree. And that by itself may be taken as a ""forward movement"" - at least Colombo will provide a forum for a dialogue.
In the meeting, scheduled for July 29, India will stress the virtues of bilateralism. Pakistan, on the other hand, is itching for internationalising the Kashmir issue. Egged on by its strategic ally, China, it is keen to have third party intervention in the Indo-Pakistan talks.
Thus, while India will try to reiterate its preference for bilateralism, Pakistan will have a no-holds-barred approach for discrediting the bilateral mechanism.
Thus, the very modality of Indo-Pak talks will be the first stumbling block which Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee and Mr Nawaz Sharif will have to overcome.
The current round of talks is taking place in the background of a letter written by Mr Vajpayee to Mr Sharif on June 14, after Pokhran-II and Chagai blasts, in which he reiterated India’s commitment fostering a peaceful and friendly relationship with Pakistan and developing a stable structure of cooperation between these two neighbours.
In his letter, Mr Vajpayee told his Pakistani counterpart that their presence at the Colombo summit would enable them to hold bilateral discussions on all issues of mutual interest and also to decide on how to proceed further with the dialogue process.
Mr Nawaz Sharif, in his reply of June 23, agreed with Mr Vajpayee’s suggestion to hold bilateral discussions during the SAARC summit.
There has been a gap of six months in meetings between the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan. In the past too multilateral events were used for holding bilateral meetings. This will be Mr Vajpayee’s first meeting with Mr Sharif. Last time the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan met was during the tenure of Mr I.K. Gujral who met Mr Nawaz Sharif in Dhaka in January 1998 (during the India-Pakistan-Bangladesh business summit). Earlier, Mr Gujral and Mr Sharif met in New York in September, 1997, (during the UN General Assembly session) and in Edinburgh in October, 1997 (during the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting).
During the bilateral meeting held between India and Pakistan Prime Ministers during the SAARC summit in Male on May 12, 1997, the revival of the hotline communication between the two Prime Ministers was agreed upon. Mr Gujral and Mr Sharif also agreed to hold Foreign Secretary-level talks in Islamabad which were held in June last year. That meeting issued a joint statement which identified eight sectors for discussions provided that a mechanism be set up for these discussions.
These included relaxation of visa regime, release of fishermen held by the two countries, and betterment of Indo-Pak trade. While India has granted the most favoured nation (MFN) status to Pakistan, the latter has not yet extended the MFN status to India. Pakistan restricts imports from India to 604 items.
With sanctions looming large over both the economies (and affecting Pakistan adversely) the SAARC summit could be an occasion for improving trade relations. Unofficial trade between India and Pakistan is estimated at around $ 1.5 billion annually.
India’s offer of discussing a no-first-use of weapons agreement with Pakistan will come up during the Vajpayee-Sharif talks. The resumption of the dialogue process between the two countries may see limited success in the economic field while the outcome of the political and diplomatic talks is anybody’s guess.","The upcoming SAARC summit in Colombo is overshadowed by nuclear tests in Pokhran and Chagai. Bilateral tensions between India and Pakistan loom large. India favors bilateral talks, while Pakistan seeks international intervention in the Kashmir issue. Prime Ministers Vajpayee and Sharif aim to discuss mutual interests, including trade and a no-first-use agreement. Despite a six-month gap in meetings, this summit provides an opportunity for dialogue. Past discussions have focused on visa relaxation, trade improvement, and regional stability. With sanctions affecting both economies, economic cooperation may see progress, but political outcomes remain uncertain.",Politics,92,706

Rameshwari (65) of Faridabad and a hawker, Kasir Ahmed (25), who were seriously injured in the explosion, succumbed to their injuries at the Neurology ward of Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital this evening, doctors at the hospital said.
The blast occurred at 11.30 a.m. soon after the Haryana Roadways bus from Safidon near Panipat was parked in the terminus after dropping the passengers.
The explosive, suspected to be RDX and kept in the rear of the bus, also shattered glasspanes of five other buses parked nearby.
The injured included the driver of the bus, Bhim Sen, the conductor of another bus, Jai Bhagwan, Rameshwari’s son Ram Kishan and Sanjay (28) of Ambala.
Meanwhile, the Delhi Government, which has ordered a magisterial probe into the incident, announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1 lakh each to next of kin of those killed and Rs 10,000 each to those injured.
The probe will be conducted by DCP (North) Jitender Narain with the assistance of DCP (North) S.N. Shrivastava and the report will be submitted within a fortnight.
""The blast was of high intensity and RDX material could have been used in the explosion,"" Joint Commissioner (northern range) S.S. Brar told PTI.
""We are in close contact with the Haryana Police"", he added.

The Tribune,1998-07-27 00:00:00,Rita Verma is BJP nominee,"NEW DELHI, July 27 (PTI) — A question mark hung over the Lok Sabha Deputy Speaker's election with the Opposition objecting to the extension of the House beyond July 31 even as the Union Cabinet today decided to reiterate its recommendation that the House sit on August 3 and 4 to facilitate holding of the election. The Cabinet, which met after the government came under attack in the Lok Sabha Business Advisory Committee for recommending extension of the House up to August 5 is understood to have decided to stick to its recommendation as it was keen that the Deputy Speaker's election be held before end of the current session.
Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies today nominated the Dhanbad MP, Ms Rita Verma, as the official candidate for the post of the Lok Sabha Deputy Speaker.
The decision was taken this morning at a meeting of the joint parliamentary meeting of the BJP and its allies which was chaired by the Prime Minister, Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee.
Announcing Ms Verma’s candidature, the Parliamentary Affairs Minister, Mr Madan Lal Khurana, said that the Lok Sabha Speaker, Mr G.M.C. Balayogi, had been requested to fix a suitable date for the election during the current session of Parliament.
As the Opposition has already declared the Congress MP, Mr P.M. Sayeed, as its candidate for the post, the contest appears to be inevitable.
But there is a serious question mark on the exact date of the contest for the Deputy Speaker’s post as the Speaker has not yet declared the election schedule.
Earlier, Mr Khurana said the party’s decision to field Ms Verma was taken in response to a demand of the BJP and its allies that a woman should be nominated for the post.
Commenting on the Congress contention that the Deputy Speakership should go to the Opposition, Mr Khurana said that the Congress had broken the convention by putting up its candidate for Speakership earlier. So, the Congress objection was baseless, he pointed out.
A teacher by profession, Ms Verma entered politics after the death of her husband — Mr Randhir Prasad Verma, an IPS officer — in an encounter with terrorists at Dhanbad in Bihar.
Born in Patna, 45-year-old Verma was elected to the 10th Lok Sabha in 1991. She was re-elected to the 11th and the 12th Lok Sabha in 1996 and 1998.
She has been a member of the various parliamentary committees. These include the Committee on Energy (convener), sub committee on coal (member), joint committee on the constitution and amendment Bill 1996 regarding reservations of 33 per cent seats for women in the Lok Sabha and state assemblies.","Uncertainty surrounds the election of the Lok Sabha Deputy Speaker as the Opposition objects to extending the House beyond July 31.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies nominate Rita Verma as the official candidate for the post. The Opposition, supporting Congress MP P.M.

The Tribune,1998-07-27 00:00:00,India to bargain with USA,"India is expected to continue its hard bargaining with the USA on issues of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation as Prime Minister’s special emissary Jaswant Singh holds crucial talks with US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on the sidelines of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) meeting commencing tomorrow.
The parleys assume significance as they come close on the heels of the third round of talks Mr Jaswant Singh had with US Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott in Delhi on July 20 and 21.
Delhi has made it clear that it will not compromise on its security interests and has categorically ruled out any rollback of its nuclear weaponisation programme.
India has also voiced its stiff opposition to the USA and other western countries linking the Kashmir issue with the Pokhran nuclear tests.
Washington, which has announced a series of punitive steps against India, has insisted that Delhi should sign the comprehensive test-ban treaty without putting any conditions, a position termed as ""unacceptable"" by it.
Officials said the meeting between Mr Jaswant Singh and Albright, the second in recent months, would pave the ground for ""clearer understanding"" of each other’s concerns.
ASEAN members are under intense pressure from the USA, China and Australia to strongly condemn India at the ARF meeting for the nuclear tests and for ""triggering"" an arms race in the region.
Asked how India would respond to the USA and China raking up the issue of nuclear tests, Mr Jaswant Singh told Indian journalists here that Delhi has already made it clear that it was not interested in any nuclear arms race in the region.
As a step in this direction, India had offered to discuss a ""no first-use"" agreement with Pakistan as also with other countries bilaterally, he said.
Japan’s proposal for inviting Pakistan for the meeting to discuss the Indo-Pak nuclear tests had been rejected by a majority of ASEAN states who had opposed any move aimed at ""India-bashing.""
India had argued that the ARF should not adopt double standards as it had not reacted sharply to the nuclear tests conducted by China and France, contending that it should not do the same in the case of India also.
Albright, who arrived this afternoon, is slated to hold parleys with ASEAN leaders and also foreign ministers of dialogue partners of the grouping such as China, Japan and Russia.
Indications of the tough postures by Western countries at the meetings were given by Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer who said the ""significant"" issue of nuclear testing by India and Pakistan would figure prominently during the deliberations.","The India-USA talks on nuclear disarmament occur as Jaswant Singh meets Madeleine Albright at the ASEAN Regional Forum. India stands firm on its nuclear program, rejecting any compromise on security interests. The USA pressures India to sign the CTBT unconditionally, but India finds it unacceptable. ASEAN faces pressure to condemn India for nuclear tests, but India argues against double standards. Japan's proposal to involve Pakistan is rejected. Albright holds talks with ASEAN leaders and dialogue partners. Australia emphasizes the significance of the nuclear testing issue.

Russian news agencies said security chief Nikolai Kovalyov was replaced by Vladimir Putin, a former intelligence officer posted to Germany during the seventies who was recently appointed Mr Yeltsin’s First Deputy Chief of Staff in charge of relations with Russia’s regions.
No reasons for the changes were given, but Mr Yeltsin had warned earlier today he was planning some hirings and firings. The Federal Security Service is the main successor to the Soviet-era KGB.
Mr Yeltsin issued his warning after a meeting with Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko at a government resort in northwestern Russia where the President is vacationing.
Decisions have been made,’’ Mr Yeltsin told reporters. Mr Yeltsin and Mr Kiriyenko discussed a variety of issues, including the situation in the breakaway region of Chechnya, whose President was the target of a failed car bomb attack, and Mr Kiriyenko’s meetings earlier in the week with US Vice-President Al Gore.
Mr Yeltsin said they also talked about how Russia can repay international loans without harming the life and well-being of people. International lenders recently agreed to a new $ 17.1 billion loan, bringing Russia’s total bailout package to $ 22.6 billion.
Mr Yeltsin signed a decree today specifying which Russian weapons can be sold to which countries, the Itar-Tass news agency said.
The decree consists of a detailed list of military goods allowed for sale abroad and a list of states cleared for such deals.

The concession follows Tripoli’s refusal to hand over the two men for trial in Scotland or the USA and the crumbling of the international air embargo imposed by the UN in retaliation.
The Observer quoted “one senior figure close to Col Gaddafi as saying that, “we accept a Scottish chairman and Scottish legal procedure, but we do not believe it would be fair if all judges come from the country where the crime took place.”
“Would two Scots accused of mass murder in Libya agree to appear before an all-Libyan bench?”

Independent counsel Kenneth Starr has escalated the pressure on Mr Clinton by issuing a subpoena requiring him to testify before the grand jury, which has been investigating his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and whether he applied pressure to convince her to lie about it under oath.
“Hopefully something can be worked out,” a source said of efforts by Mr David Kendall, the President’s lead private attorney in the case, to reach a compromise with Mr Starr that would let Mr Clinton give his version of events without having to appear physically before jurors.
Although Mr Clinton has resisted requests by Mr Starr that he voluntarily provide testimony, those close to him say the independent counsel’s use of a subpoena has changed the President’s approach.
The White House publicly signalled a new willingness to reach an agreement on Friday after the subpoena was issued, according to sources yesterday.
AFP adds: The subpoena compels President Clinton to testify in the case seeking to find out whether he had a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, now 25.
Legal scholars however disagree on whether a sitting us President can be forced to take the stand in a criminal investigation. Mr Clinton’s supporters say it is unconstitutional.
The official, who declined to give his name, gave little detail on the subpoena, saying only that it was issued by a grand jury in the past days.
The White House yesterday declined to comment on the report. “We are not having any comment regarding subpoenas,” White House spokesman Jim Kennedy told AFP. “I understand that report is out there. I don’t know the source.”

The Tribune,1998-07-29 00:00:00,Massacre rocks Houses,"NEW DELHI, July 29 — Smarting under criticism of the Opposition in Parliament over the massacre of 18 members of a particular community in the Dodder region of Jammu and Kashmir, the Union Home Minister, Mr Lal Krishna Advance, today announced that the government had prepared a strategy to crush Pakistan’s proxy war in the valley.

The massacre rocked both Houses of Parliament during zero hour with the entire Opposition condemning the government for its failure to prevent it. Some members even demanded the resignation of the Home Minister.

BJP MP Stay Pal Jan said in the Lok Sabha that there should be no politics over bodies and militancy was not something new to the country. Being associated closely with Punjab during the height of militancy, Mr Jain said his experience was that the militants had a definite objective in unleashing violence on a particular community as they wanted to divide people. He said Mr Advani, unlike his predecessors, had the courage to visit the troubled valley and the entire House should support the government in combating terrorism.

Responding to a 100-minute discussion in the Rajya Sabha, during which members demanded that the Prime Minister, Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee, who was in Colombo for the SAARC summit, should take up the matter with his Pakistani counterpart, Mr Advani said ""India would crush Pakistan’s proxy war and the internal enemies supporting it.""

Mr Advani informed the House that the Union Home Secretary, Mr B.P. Singh, the Border Security Force Director General, Mr Ram Mohan, and the Director-General (Military Intelligence) had rushed to Doda to take stock of the situation. He said three more companies of paramilitary personnel had been rushed to the region today.

The Home Minister said the government had ample information that the proxy war was being abetted by ""our own people"" in several pockets of the country and these internal enemies were being identified and action would be taken against them.

Mr Advani said the entire administration and the police should not be blamed, and cited the example of Punjab where militancy was wiped out by the administration with the cooperation of people.

No government could prevent isolated incidents from taking place, Mr Advani said, adding firm administration and strong policing had to a large extent kept a check on the activities of militants.

The Home Minister said 388 militants, including 65 foreign mercenaries, had been killed in encounters while a total of 545 foreign militants had been arrested till July this year.

On the suggestion of the Chairman, Mr Krishan Kant, and other members that the sentiments of the House should be conveyed to the Prime Minister in Colombo, Mr Advani said he would do so.

The Home Minister refuted allegations that India was also involved in creating problems in Pakistan.

Earlier, raising the issue during zero hour, which finally turned into a full fledged discussion, Mr Ghulam Nabi Azad of the Congress said there had been a spurt in militancy, particularly in Doda and Udhampur districts in the past four months and the government had failed to take any effective steps to counter it.

He said contrary to Mr Advani’s assertion earlier in Kashmir that the government would take the strictest measures to flush out militants from the area, the presence of security forces in the region had been cut by half to what it was in 1995-96.

Mr Azad suggested that village defence committees should be strengthened by providing them sophisticated weapons to counter the weaponry of militants.

Mr Vijay Kumar Malhotra of the BJP said there was conclusive evidence that Pakistan was waging a proxy war in the valley with the help of ISI agents and mercenaries.

Mr Venkaiah Naidu expressed concern about the presence of certain ""inimical"" elements in the state administration and police and said it was a serious problem and steps should be taken to weed them out.

Mr B.S. Ramoowalia said the killings were a strategy to create chaos in Jammu and Kashmir and said the common man, as in the case of Punjab, should be involved in the fight against militancy.

Dr Karan Singh of the National Conference said a cantonment should be established in Bhaderwah and the Rapid Action Force should be deployed in the sensitive areas.

Raising the issue during zero hour in the Lok Sabha, the leader of the Opposition, Mr Sharad Pawar, said both the Hindus and Muslims were being targeted by militants and expressed concern about the reduction of security forces’ strength in the region. He said there was need for firm steps to fight insurgency in the region.

Mr Rajesh Pilot said the Home Minister had talked of a pro-active policy in curbing militancy in the state and demanded to know what action plan the government had in this regard. He said the Home Minister should make a statement about this in the House.

Mr Basudeb Acharya said ever since the new government came to power, the incidents of violence had increased. He charged the Centre with being inefficient and incapable of handling the situation.

Mr Bal Ram Jakhar said terrorism should be crushed in the state and wondered why human rights organisations did not take cognisance of the activities of militants.

Dr Subramanian Swamy said a government which could not protect its own people had no right to continue and demanded the resignation of the Union Home Minister.

Mr Arif Mohammed Khan made an emotional appeal to the government to crush terrorism in the state and criticised it for its inept handling of the situation.

Mr Saiffudin Soz said it was the responsibility of the Centre to keep a vigil on the country’s borders and said it was wrong to blame the state government for the killings in the Doda region. He said the state government with a handful of policemen was in no position to fight militancy in the state.

The Union Parliamentary Affairs, Mr Madan Lal Khurana, assured the House that the Home Minister would make a statement tomorrow. He chided Opposition members for criticising the government instead of criticising the action of militants. He said the Kashmir problem was not a mere law and order problem but insurgency. He said the government was determined to wipe out terrorism in the state.

Meanwhile, the Congress has condemned the killings at Doda and said these exposed the ""hollow claims"" of the Union Home Minister on providing adequate security in the region.

""The massacre of 18 persons in two villages in Doda is the fourth dastardly act by militants since the BJP came to power. The repeated killings have sent shockwaves in the area. People are fleeing and the administration has failed to protect them,"" party spokesperson Girja Vyas said here today.

She said after the last incident, Mr Advani had visited the troubled spot and stated that Doda area was ""not so vulnerable"".

""The latest killings only indicate the helplessness of the administration and show that the central government has failed on all fronts,"" she said.

Meanwhile, Kashmiri Pandits held a demonstration here today in protest against the massacre of 18 persons in Doda.

While condemning the massacre, the demonstrators said it reflected the deteriorating law and order situation in the state.

""The promises made by the Farooq Abdullah Government have been proved to be hollow. There is no safety of our people and despite the recent killings in Doda, the government failed to take major steps to beef up security in the sensitive area. The latest killings could be averted"", a demonstrator said.

The demonstration was organised by Panun Kashmir.

The demonstrators demanded minority status for Hindus in the state and recognising Kashmiri Pandits as internally-displaced people.","The Union Home Minister, Lal Krishna Advani, announced the government's strategy to crush Pakistan's proxy war in the Kashmir Valley after the massacre of 18 members in the Doda region of Jammu and Kashmir. The opposition in Parliament criticized the government's failure to prevent the massacre, with some members demanding Advani's resignation. Advani stated that the government had prepared a strategy to eliminate Pakistan's proxy war and internal enemies supporting it. He refuted allegations of India creating problems in Pakistan and assured a crackdown on internal enemies. The government faced criticism for reducing security forces' strength in the region.

The two-day deadline for formalising the modalities was set and the two Prime Ministers concluded this round of talks, each satisfied that the other was positive and serious about a bilateral dialogue, principles and traditional reservations notwithstanding.

Kashmir figured. Replying to a media query, Mr Vajpayee said, ""Kashmir was discussed, further talks will be held"". Asked the same question, Mr Sharif, while saying that ""Kashmir is the core issue"", observed that India had some reservation on the subject.

While praising the bilateral process, which he had been pooh-poohing in recent public pronouncements, Mr Sharif told the media that he was of the opinion that ""someone from outside"" had to help on Kashmir and asked India to show ""flexibility"".

Where once militants ruled the roost, Punjab Chief Minister, Parkash Singh Badal himself interviewed the youth for various self-employed schemes today.

Accompanied by top-ranking officers, Vice-Chancellors of Punjab Agricultural University and Guru Nanak Dev University and experts from different fields, Mr Badal asked the youth: ""Beta, tuseen kee kam karna chahundey ho"" (son, what kind of work would you want to do?). The youth apprised him of their respective preferences for dairy farming, poultry farming and bee-keeping.

The Chief Minister asked the officer concerned on the spot to undertake the responsibility of giving each of them suitable vocational training and arranging financial assistance.

Earlier, addressing the gathering, Mr Badal announced that Pathri Kalan village would be made a big rural industrial centre, second after Kaljharani village in Bathinda district.

He directed the officers to create the infrastructural facilities in the next two months for imparting training to the youth in modern techniques of agriculture and allied fields. Mr Badal said the Prime Minister would be invited to launch the scheme on November 1.

Mr Badal asked the officers to spend a few days in the village, minutely study the scope for self-employment and prepare a blueprint.

The Chief Minister said such rural industrial centres would provide various services under one roof — guidance, training and infrastructural support.

The government, he said, had an ambitious programme to strengthen the canal system in Majha region at a cost of Rs 100 crore to improve irrigation in the area. He said more water would be made available for the Majha region after completion of Thein dam, which had an irrigation potential for an additional 3.40 lakh hectares.

Blaming the previous successive Congress governments for ruining the economy and social infrastructure in the state, Mr Badal said it was unfortunate that after 50 years of independence, the people's demand for water supply, roads, schools and hospitals remained unmet. He said the social service network would be further strengthened so that the common man could get basic facilities.

The Chief Minister asked the Deputy Commissioner and other district-level officers to spend four days in a week in office for paper work and two days in the field to study the problems of the people and prepare plans according to their needs.

Others who spoke on the occasion were Mr Ranjit Singh Brahmpura, Cooperation Minister, Dr Rattan Singh, Animal Husbandry Minister, Mr Gulzar Singh Ranike and Mr Adesh Partap Singh Kairon, both MLAs.

Earlier, Mr Badal paid tributes to the late Jathedar Mohan Singh Tur who remained president of the SAD for more than a decade at his native village Tur, 20 km from here, on his 19th death anniversary.

He released a grant of Rs 5 lakh for the village school building.

Speaking on the occasion, Jathedar Gurcharan Singh Tohra, president, SGPC, asked the people not to be misled by the propaganda of the Congress against the Punjab Government.","Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal interviewed educated youth in Pathri Kalan village along the Indo-Pakistan border for various self-employed schemes.

Foreign Secretary K. Raghunath held prolonged consultations with his Pakistani counterpart, Mr Shamshad Ahmed, overnight and again today at the beach resort of Benthota, 60 km from here, where leaders of seven SAARC nations, including Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee had gone for their summit retreat.

""We have not yet come to a conclusion..... We will continue discussions tomorrow,"" a senior Indian official told reporters.

Mr Vajpayee and his Pakistani counterpart, Mr Nawaz Sharif, during their first ever meeting yesterday since the two countries conducted nuclear tests, had agreed to resume the stalled negotiations and had asked their foreign secretaries to discuss the modalities for the talks while in Colombo for the summit.

While Pakistan demanded the setting up of such a group on the basis of the decision taken at the second round in Islamabad in June last year, India maintained that the subject should be discussed at the level of foreign secretaries along with that of peace and security.

Meanwhile, a senior External Affairs Ministry official said India had rejected Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s proposal made in his speech at the inaugural session of the 10th SAARC summit regarding third-party mediation or involvement of SAARC in resolving the Kashmir issue.

He said Jammu and Kashmir was an integral part of India and the talks with Pakistan had to be held within certain parameters which were ""reasonable and realistic"".

Meanwhile, SAARC leaders today agreed to initiate concrete steps to hasten the process of establishing a South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) and directed officials to complete the current round of tariff and trade negotiations for the purpose by the next month.

This decision was taken by leaders of seven member countries at their retreat meeting.

The Heads of State had comprehensive discussions on the existing trade arrangements and progress made during official-level talks to remove tariff and trade restrictions, a senior Indian official told newspersons.

The leaders agreed to initiate urgent steps to complete the third round of trade negotiations to reduce tariff barriers.

Appreciating Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee’s announcement yesterday to remove restrictions on over 2000 products actively traded in the region, leaders of other SAARC nations discussed steps to take immediate advantage of this.

The leaders also broadly agreed on a regulatory framework for the proposed SAFTA, the official said.

Meanwhile, Mr Jaswant Singh, who represented India at the ASEAN-related meetings in Manila as the Prime Minister’s special envoy, arrived here late last night. He too accompanied Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee to the beach resort. Other ministers who are assisting the Prime Minister in his discussions with other SAARC leaders are Commerce Minister R.K.

The Tribune ,1998-07-31 00:00:00,11 scribes allegedly involved in militancy,"Based on a statement claimed to have been made by a militant, the Jammu and Kashmir police today alleged that 11 journalists, non-journalists and videographers of mass media had been ‘’directly and actively’’ involved with various militant outfits in the valley.

The allegation was made by the Inspector-General of Police, Kashmir Range, P.S Gill, at a hurriedly called press conference, to which many news organisations were not invited.

A spokesman of the Kashmir Press, a representative body of local English and Urdu newspapers and periodicals, dismissed the police allegation as being aimed at ‘’maligning the Kashmir press’’.

Mr Gill said a self styled publicity chief of outlawed Hizbul Mujahideen Abdul Lateef Bhat, who was arrested by special operations group recently, had stated during interrogation that 11 journalists, non-journalists and videographers had been working actively with various outfits in the valley.

However, he said, some of the outfits they represented are now defunct.

The Kashmir police chief said the arrested militant was directly in contact with the Hizbul Mujahideen supreme commander Syed Salahuddin and deputy supreme commander Burhan-Ud-Din Hijazi on wireless and telephone in Pakistan from here.

A spokesman of the Kashmir press said allegations were made to make the press toe the government line and refrain from highlighting human rights violations allegedly committed by the Special Operations Group and other security forces in the valley.

He said the Kashmir press has decided to report events honestly without succumbing to any pressure from any quarter.","The information provided by the Jammu and Kashmir police alleges the involvement of 11 journalists, non-journalists, and videographers with various militant outfits in the valley, as claimed by a self-styled publicity chief of the outlawed Hizbul Mujahideen.

As many as 500 persons from Melwan village and the adjoining areas of Kuthotha and Kulerian marched to the police post to lodge their protest. While the men folk squatted outside the police post, women entered inside and ransacked the furniture. The DSP, Nurpur, Mr Jai Pal Singh, said that there were about too women, who sat on the dharna outside the police post.

""Apart from ransacking the furniture, the women damaged some of the case property, lying in the malkhana"", he added. In the absence of any women police personnel at the Thakur Dwara post, the male staff remained mute spectators.

The villagers sat on the dharna for about three hours. They raised slogans against the police and demanded the immediate arrest of the suspect in the murder case of a 22-year-old JBT teacher, Sunil Kumar, of Melwan village on July 24.

While Sunil Kumar was killed in the attack, another youth, Ravi Kumar, was seriously injured, and is admitted to the Mukerian Hospital. The police has registered a case under Sections 302 and 324 of the IPC against a tyre shop owner, Giani, who allegedly attacked the deceased with his kirpan.

The Tribune,1998-07-31 00:00:00,Goa issue rocks Parliament," Adjournments and bedlam marked the day in Parliament today as the Congress supported by other Opposition parties stalled proceedings in both Houses over what they described as the ""unconstitutional"" the dismissal of the Pratapsing Rane government in Goa by State Governor, Lt Gen J.F.R. Jacob. The Congress demanded the immediate recall of the Governor.

The Centre on its part maintained that it had no role in the dismissal of the Pratapsing Rane government and the installation of a rebel faction of the Congress led by the Chief Minister, Mr Wilfred d'Souza, as the Governor had used his authority and provisions of Constitution.

""This is not a decision of the Central Government. We have been informed of what has happened,"" the Union Home Minister, Mr L.K. Advani, said in the Lok Sabha.

According to reports from Panaji, the Governor had used his ""inherent discretion"" and powers vested in him under Article 164 of the Constitution. The Centre is involved only when Article 356 is used for imposing President’s rule in any state.

The Lok Sabha had to be adjourned twice and again for the day as Congress members, supported by the RJD and the RPI, took their protest into the well of the House and demanded the recall of the state Governor.

The Rajya Sabha, too, could not make any headway with the day’s listed business as the Congress members dominated the pre-lunch session with their tirade against the Goa Governor and the Centre and forced an adjournment in the post-lunch session with their persistent demand for a discussion on the Goa issue. The Congress members stuck to their stand even when the House reassembled at 4 pm and the Deputy Chairperson, Mrs Najma Heptullah, left with no other option adjourned the House for the day.

The Congress members in both the Houses were on their feet the moment the proceedings began at 11 am and condemned the action of the Goa Governor.

In the Lok Sabha, during zero hour, the Deputy Leader of the Congress, Mr P. Shiv Shankar, raised the issue and described the action of the Goa Governor as ""rape of democracy"".

Describing the events in Goa over the past three days, Mr Shiv Shankar said it was a matter of regret that the BJP which had been raising its voice against the misuse of Article 356 had proved by its action that it had no faith in the Constitution.

Former Speaker, Mr P.A. Sangma, also joined Mr Shiv Shankar in attacking the government and accused the Centre of conniving with the state Governor in dismissing a democratically elected government which had proved its majority in the state assembly.

The Congress found support in the CPM with its leader, Mr Somnath Chatterjee describing the Governor’s action as a ""declaration of war"" against the Constitution.

The Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister, Mr Madan Lal Khurana, said the Centre had nothing to do with the decision of the Governor as he had exercised his power under Article 164.

Thereafter members of the Congress, the RJD and the RPI rushed to the well of the House and started raising slogans demanding the recall of the Governor. Amidst the pandemonium, the Speaker, Mr G.M.C. Balayogi, adjourned the House till 2 pm.

When the House reassembled, the Speaker announced that he had received notices from Congress members, Mr Ajit Jogi and Mr P.J. Kurien under Rule 184 for a discussion on the issue followed by a voting on the motion. He said he would examine the matter and also seek the official report from the Home Ministry before taking any decision.

The Home Minister, too, placed the government’s view on the issue but the Congress members were in no mood to listen. They again trooped to the well of the House and ignored the Speaker’s repeated request to them to take their seat. The House was adjourned for the second time.

The scene was similar in the House after it reassembled for the second time in the day with slogan-shouting members rushing to the well demanding the recall of the Goa Governor.

Mr V. Sathyamoorthy, who was in the Chair, sought to take up special motion and asked the Civil Aviation Minister, Mr Ananth Kumar, to make a statement on the air crash at Kochi this morning. The Minister’s statement could not be heard amidst uproar. Sensing the mood of the Opposition members, he adjourned the House for the day.

Dr Manmohan Singh took up the issue in the Rajya Sabha as soon as the House assembled for the day and said a grave constitutional crisis had been created in Goa by the Governor’s most ""conspicuous misuse"" of his position.

The Chairman, Mr Krishan Kant, announced that he was allowing a structured discussion on the issue in place of a mere mention by the Leader of the Opposition.

BJP’s Venkaiah Naidu raised a point of order at this juncture and submitted that the Home Minister’s presence was required for such a debate.

The Congress members opposed Mr Naidu’s contention and a brief verbal clash between the ruling and the Opposition benches ensued. Mr Kant then ruled that the discussion could go on as the Leader of the House, Mr Sikander Bakht’s presence was enough till the Home Minister came.

Speaking for the Congress, Mr Kapil Sibal, explained the events in Goa and said Mr Jacob’s action could set a bad precedent as other state government’s too could be dismissed in this manner.

He said the Centre’s failure to recall the Governor would indicate that it was hand in glove with Mr Jacob. He also demanded that the act should be declared ultra vires.

Mr Pranab Mukherjee said the Governor’s action was ""unconstitutional"".

Mr Venkaiah Naidu defended the Governor’s action saying Mr Jacob was within his rights to install the new government in Goa. He said it was the Speaker of the Goa Assembly who flouted all norms and provisions of the Constitution by debarring 10 members of the split Congress Legislative Party from exercising their vote during the confidence vote sought by Mr Pratapsing Rane.

Criticising the previous Congress regimes for flouting the Constitution he said they were responsible for the dismissal of 82 state governments in the past. He referred to the dismissal of the N.T. Rama Rao government in Andhra Pradesh in 1984, as a case in point.

Mr Biplab Dasgupta of the CPM described the Governor’s action as ""brutal, ruthless and premeditated.""

When the House reassembled after lunch, agitated Congress members demanded that the House adopt a motion for the recall of the Goa Governor. Led by Mr Pranab Mukherjee, the members said it was a question of procedure as the House could take up only a motion and not discuss Governor’s conduct which amounted to encroaching upon state autonomy.

With BJP members contesting the Congress point, some members of the Opposition rushed to the well of the House to press their demand. Mrs Heptullah then adjourned the House for an hour.

The House was finally adjourned for the day within minutes after the Rajya Sabha met at 4 pm. The members from the ruling side and the Opposition were engaged in a verbal duel on the procedure to be adopted. Ruling party members argued that conversion of the discussion was not proper as it would amount to overruling the Chairman’s decision to allow only a short duration discussion.","In both Houses of Parliament, bedlam ensued as the Congress and Opposition parties protested against the dismissal of the Pratapsing Rane government in Goa by Governor Lt Gen J.F.R. Jacob. Congress demanded the Governor's recall, stalling proceedings. The Centre maintained it wasn't involved, citing the Governor's constitutional authority. Ruling party members attempted to limit the debate in the Lok Sabha. Congress led the opposition in both houses, demanding the Governor's recall. The Speaker and Chairman allowed structured discussions, but chaos prevailed, resulting in multiple adjournments throughout the day, with no tangible resolution achieved amidst vehement contentions on constitutional validity.",Politics,99,1228
The Tribune,1998-07-31 00:00:00,Chandrika snubs Sharif,"The warmth displayed by the two prime ministers during the bilateral meeting yesterday has not resulted in a discernible thawing of Indo-Pakistan relations.

The two foreign secretaries burnt the proverbial midnight oil yesterday (the meeting lasted till 1.30 am today); they met at the Benthota retreat today (while Joint Secretary-level officials talked to each other in Colombo).

The Foreign Secretary-level talks, for which a two-day framework

was set yesterday have now been extended till tomorrow.

Pakistan’s Prime Minister, Mr Nawaz Sharif, created an unprecedented situation at the retreat — he tried to inject non-charter agenda into the SAARC summit and as a result was snubbed by the summit chairperson and Sri Lankan President,

Mrs Chandrika Bandarnaike Kumaratunga.

It was perhaps a reflection of the Pakistani attitude not only to the SAARC summit but also to India-Pakistan relations: At the outset of the retreat, Mr Sharif personally circulated to the summit leaders a paper containing the Pakistan proposal for a South Asian initiative on peace, security and development — a subject he had mooted at his Summit speech yesterday.

The summit leaders ignored the paper. At the end of the day when Mr Sharif referred to his note, Mrs Kumaratunga snubbed him openly by saying that there was no intention of the summit leaders to deviate from the SAARC agenda, namely, accelerated economic development of the region, with an emphasis on trade, economy, social issues and technological cooperation.

Significantly not one country came to Pakistan’s aid at Benthota today. Yesterday, the SAARC chairperson had observed that ""serious note"" would be taken of Mr Sharif’s proposal. With today’s snub, the possibility of even that receded to the background.

Even while the Colombo Declaration (to be issued tomorrow) was being drafted at the foreign ministers’ level, Pakistan had attempted to inject peace and security into the document. It failed then. It failed at Benthota today.

Meanwhile the two Foreign Secretaries struggled to work out the nuts and bolts of the resumption of the India-Pakistan dialogue. Though the talks had last been held on June 23 last year, rust seems to have gathered on the nuts and bolts and thus it is taking time to ease out the situation.

The optimism displayed after the Vajpayee-Sharif talks yesterday may not result in a success story being written in a two-day framework. However, a positive twist has been given. Even if India and Pakistan agree to disagree at the bilateral level in Colombo, it will not mean that the continuing process of bilateral talks will not go on.","The warmth between the Prime Ministers failed to thaw Indo-Pakistan relations. The Foreign Secretaries met at Benthota, extending talks, struggling to resume dialogue. Pakistani PM's non-charter agenda was snubbed at the SAARC summit by Sri Lankan President, emphasizing regional economic development. Pakistan’s initiative on peace and security was rejected by all summit leaders. Despite optimistic dialogue after Vajpayee-Sharif talks, bilateral discussions' slow progress at Colombo indicates prolonged challenges. Even if India and Pakistan don't concur, it won't impede the ongoing bilateral talks. Rusty diplomatic intricacies slow down the resumption of dialogue amid the positive ambiance post the Prime Ministers' meet.",Politics,100,422

The Nobel Laureate, who, supporters said, was suffering from dehydration and fever, was quoted by a National League for Democracy (NLD) spokesman as demanding the junta release all of her jailed supporters and set a date for direct talks with the Opposition.

“I shall continue to go out of Yangon again and again as soon as I recover until these conditions are met,” she said. Suu Kyi urged supporters to remain strong in their battle with the junta, the spokesman told a press conference, which was also packed with foreign Ambassadors and other diplomats. “I am as strong as ever,” she said.

NLD officials said Suu Kyi was “furious” that she was forcibly returned to Yangon and the party was considering legal action against the authorities.

“She accused the military authorities of forcibly abducting her, hijacking her car and using physical force,” NLD Chairman Aung Shwe said.

NLD Deputy Chairman Tin Oo added the junta’s treatment of Suu Kyi, who holds the post of party secretary-general, was “inhuman”.

Described by colleagues as ill and running low on food, Aung San Suu Kyi returned home last night after being stopped at a military roadblock for six days, the government said.

A statement said top leaders of her political party went to the roadblock site west of Yangon, to persuade her to return home.

SYDNEY: US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Thursday accused the Myanmar junta of violating the rights of Aung San Suu Kyi by forcing her to end a six-day roadside protest.

Albright said the Nobel Laureate “all of a sudden was taken in her car by a military driver back to Yangon.”

This is an unacceptable violation of her human rights and will only contribute to further isolation of Myanmar,” she said at a speech to Asia Society in Sydney, ahead of bilateral talks here.","Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi pledged to defy the country's junta and attempt to leave Yangon again for meetings with supporters.

The Tribune ,1998-07-31 00:00:00,Ousting families for shopping plaza,"On the one hand the state government is keen to create conditions for displaced families to return to Kashmir and on the other it plans to acquire valuable assets of Kashmiri Hindus. This may even force families which have not migrated from the valley so far to leave.

At a meeting in Srinagar on July 8 to review the working of the Housing and Urban Development Department, Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah took several decisions, including the decision to acquire land under two petrol stations and a palatial house on the fashionable Maulana Azad Road for construction of a modern shopping plaza.

The two petrol stations and the house are owned by Kashmiri Hindus. Interestingly, none of the three owners have migrated from the valley. The owners feel that they are being singled out for this drastic action which could deprive them of their means of livelihood. They say the property belonged to their ancestors and they have not encroached upon government land.

Inside reports say the Chief Minister has been taken for a ride by one of his Cabinet colleagues who had felt hurt when a Kashmiri Hindu purchased Bengal Motors. The minister, too, wanted to buy the same for expanding business. The minister is said to have influenced the Chief Minister.

What is further intriguing is the fact that the building housing the Congress headquarters has not been acquired because it belongs to an association headed by the Minister for Housing and Urban Development.

The government plans to build a shopping plaza on one side of Pratap Park where already a big shopping centre exists on the other side.

The aggrieved families have decided to approach the Chief Minister after he returns to Kashmir from London. They have already approached several ministers.","The state government in Kashmir is reportedly planning to acquire valuable assets, including two petrol stations and a house owned by Kashmiri Hindus, for the construction of a modern shopping plaza.

The Tribune,1998-07-31 00:00:00,Presidential reference: SC notices,"A Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court today issued notices to the Centre and advocates-general of all states and union territories while beginning hearing on the presidential reference raising doubts over the procedure involving the consultation process on the appointment of judges to the apex court and high courts and their transfers.

The nine-Judge Bench headed by Mr Justice A.S. Anand also issued notice to the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association as it was the petitioner before an earlier nine-Judge Bench which in 1993 laid down principles and prescribing procedural norms relating to the appointment of judges to the Supreme Court, chief justices and judges of the high courts and the transfer of high court judges.

The Bench made the notices returnable by September 15 when the reference would be taken up for further directions.

The court also asked Attorney General Soli Sorabjee to place on record the pre-1993 and post-1993 memoranda of procedure on the appointment of judges and their transfers to make the issues relating to the doubts referred in the presidential reference more clear.

The Bench also asked the Attorney-General to produce in court the material that provoked the doubts in the mind of the government.

On repeated requests made by senior advocates K.K. Venugopal and R.K. Jain on behalf of the Bar Association of India (BAI) and the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) to be heard on the issue, the Bench asked them to file intervention applications which would be heard on the next date of hearing.

The court also said other bar associations and organisations which wished to be heard on the presidential reference ""may file intervention applications"".

In a jampacked courtroom, Attorney-General Soli Sorabjee began his address to the Bench by citing earlier procedures adopted by the court while dealing with the presidential references on the issues of the Special Courts Bill and the Ram Janmabhoomi Babri Masjid issues.

Mr Sorabjee said it was a practice to issue notices to state advocates- general and a public notice for all concerned parties to make intervention applications.

The Bench said the reference was for the interpretation of the consultation process between the Chief Justice of India (CJI) and the government and declined to issue a public notice, saying ""the court was not interested in making it more the merrier. We want to solve the matter and not publicise it.""

The Bench headed by Mr Justice Anand comprised Mr Justice S.P. Bharucha, Mr Justice M.K. Mukherjee, Mr Justice S.B. Majumdar, Mr Justice Sujata V. Manohar, Mr Justice G.T. Nanavati, Mr Justice S. Saghir Ahmad, Mr Justice K. Venkataswami and Mr Justice B.N. Kripal.

The Bench by a majority view overruled a question raised by one of the judges regarding the maintainability of the reference at this stage.

The Bench observed that the maintainability question could be deliberated after the issuance of the notice to the Union of India, advocates-general and others.

Mr Justice Saghir Ahmad asked Mr Sorabjee as to what was the necessity of the reference as there was an agreement between the Chief Justice of India and the government on the memorandum of procedure concerning the appointment of judges and their transfer.

""The 1993 judgement of the nine-Judge Bench which laid down the procedure was understood by the government and the Chief Justice of India,"" Mr Justice Ahmad said and asked where was the question of any doubt at this stage.

He observed citing an apex court ruling that ""the Supreme Court has held that as a point of law has been decided before, a presidential reference on the same point would not be maintainable.""

Mr Justice Ahmad further observed that as this was the preliminary stage of hearing, ""we should consider the maintainability of the reference.""

The reference by the President exercising constitutional powers under Article 143(1) had said ""doubts have arisen about the interpretation of the law laid down by the Supreme Court and it is in public interest that the said doubts relating to the appointment and transfer of judges be resolved.""

The president referred nine questions to the court for its consideration and sought its opinion thereon in the light of the 1993 judgement of the court laying down principles and prescribing procedural norms in regard to the appointment of Supreme Court judges, chief justices and judges of the high court and transfer of judges from one high court to another.","The Supreme Court's Constitution Bench issued notices to the Centre, state advocates-general, and associations, commencing the hearing on the presidential reference regarding doubts over judge appointments and transfers. The Bench, headed by Justice A.S. Anand, asked for pre- and post-1993 procedures on judicial appointments. Attorney General Soli Sorabjee was directed to present material provoking the government's concerns. The Bench declined publicizing the issue, aiming for resolution. It overruled a maintainability query and indicated further debate after issuing notices. Justice Saghir Ahmad questioned the reference's necessity, pointing to a prior understanding between the Chief Justice and the government on judicial procedures.

""We have not yet come to a conclusion..... We will continue discussions tomorrow,"" a senior Indian official told reporters.

Mr Vajpayee and his Pakistani counterpart, Mr Nawaz Sharif, during their first ever meeting yesterday since the two countries conducted nuclear tests, had agreed to resume the stalled negotiations and had asked their foreign secretaries to discuss the modalities for the talks while in Colombo for the summit.

While Pakistan demanded the setting up of such a group on the basis of the decision taken at the second round in Islamabad in June last year, India maintained that the subject should be discussed at the level of foreign secretaries along with that of peace and security.

Meanwhile, a senior External Affairs Ministry official said India had rejected Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s proposal made in his speech at the inaugural session of the 10th SAARC summit regarding third-party mediation or involvement of SAARC in resolving the Kashmir issue.

He said Jammu and Kashmir was an integral part of India and the talks with Pakistan had to be held within certain parameters which were ""reasonable and realistic"".

Meanwhile, SAARC leaders today agreed to initiate concrete steps to hasten the process of establishing a South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) and directed officials to complete the current round of tariff and trade negotiations for the purpose by the next month.

The Heads of State had comprehensive discussions on the existing trade arrangements and progress made during official-level talks to remove tariff and trade restrictions, a senior Indian official told newspersons.

the tribune,1998-07-31 00:00:00,CM interviews youth for jobs From H.S. Bhanwer,"PATHRI KALAN (Amritsar) July 30 — It was a rare occasion for the educated youth of this sleepy village and adjoining hamlets along the Indo-Pakistan border. Where once militants ruled the roost, Punjab Chief Minister, Parkash Singh Badal himself interviewed the youth for various self-employed schemes today.

Accompanied by top-ranking officers, Vice-Chancellors of Punjab Agricultural University and Guru Nanak Dev University and experts from different fields, Mr Badal asked the youth: ""Beta, tuseen kee kam karna chahundey ho"" (son, what kind of work would you want to do?). The youth apprised him of their respective preferences for dairy farming, poultry farming and bee-keeping.

The Chief Minister asked the officer concerned on the spot to undertake the responsibility of giving each of them suitable vocational training and arranging financial assistance.

Earlier, addressing the gathering, Mr Badal announced that Pathri Kalan village would be made a big rural industrial centre, second after Kaljharani village in Bathinda district.

He directed the officers to create the infrastructural facilities in the next two months for imparting training to the youth in modern techniques of agriculture and allied fields. Mr Badal said the Prime Minister would be invited to launch the scheme on November 1.

Mr Badal asked the officers to spend a few days in the village, minutely study the scope for self-employment and prepare a blueprint.

The Chief Minister said such rural industrial centres would provide various services under one roof — guidance, training and infrastructural support.

The government, he said, had an ambitious programme to strengthen the canal system in Majha region at a cost of Rs 100 crore to improve irrigation in the area. He said more water would be made available for the Majha region after completion of Thein dam, which had an irrigation potential for an additional 3.40 lakh hectares.

Blaming the previous successive Congress governments for ruining the economy and social infrastructure in the state, Mr Badal said it was unfortunate that after 50 years of independence, the people's demand for water supply, roads, schools and hospitals remained unmet. He said the social service network would be further strengthened so that the common man could get basic facilities.

The Chief Minister asked the Deputy Commissioner and other district-level officers to spend four days in a week in office for paper work and two days in the field to study the problems of the people and prepare plans according to their needs.

Others who spoke on the occasion were Mr Ranjit Singh Brahmpura, Cooperation Minister, Dr Rattan Singh, Animal Husbandry Minister, Mr Gulzar Singh Ranike and Mr Adesh Partap Singh Kairon, both MLAs.

Earlier, Mr Badal paid tributes to the late Jathedar Mohan Singh Tur who remained president of the SAD for more than a decade at his native village Tur, 20 km from here, on his 19th death anniversary.

He released a grant of Rs 5 lakh for the village school building.

Speaking on the occasion, Jathedar Gurcharan Singh Tohra, president, SGPC, asked the people not to be misled by the propaganda of the Congress against the Punjab Government.","The Chief Minister asked the Deputy Commissioner and other district-level officers to spend four days in a week in office for paper work and two days in the field to study the problems of the people and prepare plans according to their needs.

the tribune,1998-08-01 00:00:00,Congress studying Jain report,"The Congress started preparations for a discussion on the final report of the Jain Commission of Inquiry which was tabled in Parliament today along with the action taken report (ATR) amid indications that action would be demanded by it against those indicted, including the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister, Mr K. Karunanidhi.

The party, which will be formalising its strategy over the weekend ahead of the two-day debate starting on August 4, is now expected to demand action against individuals indicted.

The Congress which withdrew support to the United Front Government during November last year over reports indicting the DMK’s involvement, today said the report of the commission was over an issue which had ‘sentimental overtones’’.

Officially, the Congress spokesman, Mr Ajit Jogi, maintained the party would react only after perusing the report and the ATR while maintaining that it would not compromise on the issue of action against those who had been indicted.

A six-member panel of party members, including Mr Arjun Singh, Mr P. Shiv Shanker, Mr Ajit Jogi, Mr Kapil Sibal, Mr Mani Shanker Aiyer and AICC lawyer R.N. Mittal, were studying the report and expected to brief senior leaders shortly.

Party sources said an informal meeting of the Congress Working Committee could be held soon after it to finalise the strategy which would then be communicated to the parliamentary wing.

The customary end-of-the-session meeting of the Congress Parliamentary Party is scheduled for August 4, which is to be addressed by the CPP Chairperson, Mrs Sonia Gandhi.

The commission in its report has exonerated three former prime ministers — Mr V.P. Singh, Mr Chandra Shekha and Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao — stating that ""all three occupied the high office of the Prime Minister and by no stretch of imagination it can be said that any of them entertained any such intention to be in any way connected with the conspiracy to assassinate Mr Rajiv Gandhi"".

On the role of the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister, Mr K. Karunanidhi, the commission had made serious observations in its interim report and stated that ""from the evaluation of the material the conclusion is irresistible that there was tacit support to the LTTE by Mr Karunanidhi and his government and law enforcement agencies"".

Meanwhile, the BJP today welcomed the government’s decision to set up a multi-disciplinary monitoring agency in the CBI to keep a tab on the movements of the accused named in the Jain Commission's report.

Addressing newspersons, BJP general secretary, Mr M. Venkaiah Naidu said that Justice M.C. Jain in his report on the conspiracy angle of the assassination of the former Prime Minister, Mr Rajiv Gandhi, had stressed the need for a further inquiry into the role of persons like Chandraswami and Dr Subramaniam Swamy who refused to divulge to the commission information about the monetary transactions conducted by Mr Chandraswami.

Mr Naidu said that though Mr Chandraswami’s connections with the BCCI had been established and money was received by Adnan Khashoggi but who was the end user of the money required to be immediately probed.

The BJP leader said that the Congress must explain now whether its withdrawal of support to the United Front Government last year and forcing another election on the people was justified.

The Tribune,1998-08-01 00:00:00,Indo-Pak talks end in a stalemate,"The two-leg India-Pakistan showdown in Colombo has ended with India underscoring its points in the multilateral leg, namely, the 10th SAARC summit, whereas in the bilateral leg, despite show of mutual warmth by Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee and Mr Nawaz Sharif on Wednesday, a stalemate, resulting in a ""washout"" has been the result.

Use of cricketing parlance may not be out of place while this despatch is being filed from the land of the world champions, Sri Lanka. In the recent Singer Cup, matches were washed out by rain. Though the weather was minus downpours for the three days of the summit (it was mostly sunny), in both multilateral and bilateral legs, India and Pakistan could not come to a conclusion.

In the multilateral front, India can look back to Colombo with pride. Its penchant for keeping political issues at bay was appreciated and the SAARC Chairperson, Mrs Chandrika Bandarnaike Kumaratunga, blew the whistle whenever Pakistan crossed the 'Lakshman-rekha' of the SAARC Charter. In fact at Bentota yesterday she had stopped short of showing the ""yellow card"" to Mr Nawaz Sharif.

SAARC’s emphasis on economic relations and its appreciation of steps being taken by India to push the fast-forward button in the movement from the present preferential trade arrangement to free trade in South Asia (and in the interregnum, offer of bilateral free trade with those who want it) have been major achievements during Mr Vajpayee’s maiden trip to foreign shores.

On the bilateral plane, though, Mr Vajpayee seems to have misjudged the mood of Mr Sharif. As the Foreign Secretary-level talks could not produce a definite result in two days, Pakistan, in a statement, suggested that the announcement of the talks had been done ""unilaterally"" by Mr Vajpayee. (India, however, did not argue with this formulation.)

The Pakistani statement issued here today said: ""The dialogue remains stalemated and no progress has been made in Colombo"". The statement added: ""At the heart of the problem lies the rigid and inflexible position which India continues to maintain in its refusal to address the issues of peace and security and Jammu and Kashmir dispute"".

To make the matters worse, the Pakistani spokesman today circulated to the media a ""non-paper"" by Pakistan on confidence building measures in Jammu and Kashmir, which said:

""We proposed the following confidence building measures with a view to bringing about relaxation of tensions in Jammu and Kashmir: (a) the strengthening of UNMOGIP and authority to patrol on both sides of the LoC, with regular reports to the UN Security Council; (b) the release of Kashmiri detainees; (c) the removal of Indian army pickets in Srinagar and other Kashmiri towns and villages; (d) the phased reduction of Indian troops from IHK’s towns and villages; (e) the cessation of search/arrest operations; (f) the transmission of information about ‘missing persons’ in IHK; (g) the stationing of ICRC and UN human rights monitors in IHK; (h) the recognition of All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) as legitimate Kashmiri representative"".

It further said: ""India should consider the above suggestions in the context of efforts towards seriously addressing the Jammu and Kashmir issue, which is the core problem between Pakistan and India"".

India reacted calmy. A two-page statement released by Foreign Secretary, Mr K. Raghunath, said: ""An obsessive focus on a single issue or a one-point agenda is as neurotic for individuals as for nation states"".

For India, the Colombo Declaration issued by the 10th SAARC summit had been a decisive victory not only in the region, but in the global perspective. Categorically taking note of India’s irreducible security concerns, the Colombo Declaration also in effect endorsed India’s position on the NPT and the CTBT and echoed India’s Rajiv Gandhi vintage demand for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons.

Pakistan’s bid for a peace, security and development initiative for South Asia failed to take off at all. This, coupled with the SAARC’s endorsement of India’s irreducible security concerns (that nuclear weapons with China pose a threat; that the nuclear ""haves"" must talk of the CTBT and the NPT on equal terms, not from a position of advantage) was reflected in paragraph 78 of the Colombo Declaration, which said:

""The Heads of State of Government were of the view that stability, peace and security in South Asia could not be considered in isolation of the global security environment. Although great power rivalry which the NAM had consistently opposed, no longer posed a serious threat and the danger of a global nuclear conflagration had abated yet some states had sought to maintain huge arsenals of nuclear weapons. The NPT and the CTBT, to which some SAARC members were signatories, had not led to any progress towards nuclear disarmament nor prevented proliferation. They underscored their commitment to the complete elimination of nuclear weapons and the need for promoting nuclear disarmament on a universal basis, under effective international control. They recognised that global non-proliferation goals cannot be achieved in the absence of progress towards nuclear disarmament and in this context called upon all nuclear weapon states, whether party or non-party to the NPT engage constructively through a transparent and credible process of negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament"".

The stalemate in Indo-Pak bilateral talks thus has to be viewed in the total perspective. Before Mr Nawaz Sharif embarked on his Colombo trip, he had a major reverse at home: the Pakistan Supreme Court questioned the justification behind suspension of fundamental rights under the emergency declared by Mr Sharif’s government in the aftermath of nuclear blasts. The Pakistan Supreme Court felt that financial emergency need not be accompanied by the suspension of fundamental rights.

Hence, Mr Sharif was besieged at home; he did not find any talkers for his line in Colombo (or during the retreat at Bentota). The atmosphere for creating a situation other than a stalemate, therefore, did not exist in Colombo when India and Pakistan got down to negotiations.

There is a silver lining: while announcing failure of the talks, the Pakistani spokesman said two things:

""It is expected that the two Prime Ministers will have their next meeting at the sidelines of the NAM summit in Durban, South Africa"".
""We hope that the two sides will remain in touch through diplomatic channels to overcome the difficulties and resumption of the dialogue"".
India and Pakistan, thus, have agreed to disagree. They have not said ""no"" to talks. India would like the talks to be bilateral; Pakistan is itching for the third party intervention.

India wants a ""broad-based and composite"" dialogue. As Mr Raghunath put it, ""serious discussions can take place on foundations which are realistic and not on the basis of fantasies"".

""Engaging in dialogue itself is a forward movement"", the Foreign Secretary said and emphasised that there was no place for interlocutors. ""There is no place for involvement of any party, whether call it mediation or use any other term"", he clarified.

Thus, Colombo has not been the venue for a thaw in India-Pakistan relations. Yet there is hope. Free India and Pakistan owe their existence as independent nation states to developments in Durban, South Africa, from where the journey of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi began. Though Pakistan was born against the Mahatma’s wishes, in today’s reality, perhaps, both India and Pakistan can look to Durban with hope.","The India-Pakistan engagement in Colombo concluded with a clear distinction: success in multilateral discussions at the 10th SAARC summit but a stalemate in bilateral talks despite initial warmth between Atal Behari Vajpayee and Nawaz Sharif. India showcased adeptness in keeping political issues separate within SAARC, notably receiving approval for trade advancement and emphasis on economic relations. However, on the bilateral front, Vajpayee may have misjudged Sharif’s disposition, resulting in a dialogue impasse. Pakistan proposed confidence-building measures for Kashmir, met by India’s calm response emphasizing a comprehensive dialogue grounded in realism. Despite the deadlock, hope remains for future discussions, with the next meeting anticipated at the NAM summit in Durban, South Africa.",International News,111,1211

While the people of Sunam disowned Udham Singh after he shot dead Michael O'Dyer at whose behest thousands of innocent people were killed at Jallianwala Bagh, they quarrelled over how he should be depicted and eventually erected two statues showing him as a Hindu and a Sikh, respectively.

The government, which did not want to be involved in the quarrel, erected a Flame of Liberty at the stadium here. It was here that Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal and other people paid their respects to the martyr today.

The compounds of both statues, erected around 200 metres from each other, were bereft of any people today nor did the public pay obeisance at the two memorials.

Many people feel the controversy generated by erecting two kinds of statues has besmirched the lofty stands of secularism espoused by Udham Singh who called himself Ram Mohammad Singh Azad. They feel the controversy should be ended once and for all and a separate befitting memorial be constructed in the martyr's honour.

However, despite more than 30 years having passed since the construction of the statues, old sores remain. Vipan Kumar, a shopkeeper, claimed the issue was needlessly given a religious colour as the first statue was only an attempt to portray Udham Singh as he was arrested in London. However, another lobby feels a deliberate attempt was made to prove that Udham Singh was a Hindu which was untrue and could not be accepted.

The controversy started when Udham Singh's ashes were brought to Sunam in July, 1974. While a part of the ashes was kept at the local Shaheed Udham Singh College, other parts were immersed in the Ganga at Hardwar and at Kiratpur Sahib, besides being sent to the Jallianwala Bagh and the dargah at Sirhind. However the quarrel started when it was first decided that a statue of him as shown in photographs wearing a hat and suit when arrested after shooting Michael O'Dyer be constructed.

Though an attempt was made to arrive at a consensus by adding a Hindu-style turban and moustaches to the statue, another statue depicting the martyr with a turban and beard was also erected soon after.

There are also discrepancies in the two memorials. While the memorial depicting him as a Hindu proclaims his date of birth as 1889, that in which he is depicted as a Sikh has his date of birth as 1899. In the Flame of Liberty memorial, the date of birth is given as 1903.

Jagan Nath Sandha, who has penned a book on Udham Singh, has said that the controversy over the statues was raised for vested interests. He says little did people remember that Udham Singh had himself said,"" Na mein dharam ke bandhan mein hun, na mein mazhab ke kayal hun, mera to desh Bharat hai, sada iska mein sheda hun.""","Sunam struggles with Udham Singh's legacy, once disowned for avenging Jallianwala Bagh. The town's discord led to two statues, Hindu and Sikh depictions, sparking controversy. Government's Flame of Liberty memorialized him neutrally. Despite today's respects, public presence at the statues was absent, revealing persisting divides. Critics urge a unified memorial, emphasizing Singh's secular ideals. The 30-year-old rift stems from the portrayal during his arrest, divided by religious cues. Discrepancies in birth dates further fuel discord. Amid vested interests, Singh's words echo, underscoring patriotism over religion or creed: ""I am not bound by faith; my country is India, and I forever belong to it.""",National News,103,495
The Tribune,1998-08-01 00:00:00,Supreme Court stays HC order on traffic regulations,"The Supreme Court today stayed the operation of the order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court of July 9, 1998, through which various directions were issued to the Governments of Punjab and Haryana, besides the Chandigarh Administration, for regulating vehicular traffic and pollution control.

The order of the apex court followed a special leave petition (SLP) filed by the Chandigarh Administration.

The administration maintained that the petition raised substantial questions of law of general public importance. These questions included whether the high court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 226 could have overlooked and ignored the provisions of law and given directions in complete violation of these provisions of law, including the Motor Vehicles Act, Capital of Punjab (Development and Regulation) Act, and rules framed thereunder.

Whether the high court was justified in giving a direction to be implemented fort with, thus taking away the right of appeal of the petitioner, especially when an application was moved by the administration before the high court for grant of time for filing an appeal against the impugned judgement. In the SLP, the administration maintained that its officers had been called repeatedly to explain as to why the directions had not been complied with. The court later granted time up to today (July 31) and had called the officers on August 3 for apprising the court of the directions having been complied with or not.

The administration also questioned whether the high court had not committed a grave error in imposing its own pre-conceived notions and prejudices regarding urban planning and road planning in particular? For example, the SLP said, its order to make radical and totally unimplementable changes in the lay out, structure and road planning of the city, while overruling expert advice in making recommendations such as that one-way traffic shall be introduced virtually throughout the city, even though the city was planned on the basis of the inter-sectoral roads called V-3 roads and V-2 roads (major city thoroughfares), V-4 roads (commercial streets with shops deliberately kept on one side of the road behind a parking space), V-5 roads (being loop roads inside each sector) providing access to the lesser. It was improbable that there was any such city in the world consisting almost entirely of one-way roads as required by the high court.

The same question, the administration said, applied also to the directions that side lanes should be provided without exception to all ""main roads"" of Chandigarh, without even defining which category of roads were main roads for this purpose.","The Supreme Court halted the Punjab and Haryana High Court's July 9, 1998 order regulating traffic and pollution control in Punjab, Haryana, and Chandigarh. This action came after a special leave petition by the Chandigarh Administration raised significant legal questions. It challenged the High Court's authority to give directives that disregarded existing laws like the Motor Vehicles Act and the Capital of Punjab Act. The petition questioned the High Court's imposition of immediate orders, hindering the administration's appeal rights, and criticized the High Court's mandates, terming them impractical and against established urban planning norms, like insisting on nearly entirely one-way roads across the city without defining main roads.",Crime and Justice,108,423
The Tribune,1998-08-01 00:00:00,Indo-Pak talks end in a stalemate,"COLOMBO, July 31 — The two-leg India-Pakistan showdown in Colombo has ended with India underscoring its points in the multilateral leg, namely, the 10th SAARC summit, whereas in the bilateral leg, despite show of mutual warmth by Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee and Mr Nawaz Sharif on Wednesday, a stalemate, resulting in a ""washout"" has been the result.

Use of cricketing parlance may not be out of place while this despatch is being filed from the land of the world champions, Sri Lanka. In the recent Singer Cup, matches were washed out by rain. Though the weather was minus downpours for the three days of the summit (it was mostly sunny), in both multilateral and bilateral legs, India and Pakistan could not come to a conclusion.

In the multilateral front, India can look back to Colombo with pride. Its penchant for keeping political issues at bay was appreciated and the SAARC Chairperson, Mrs Chandrika Bandarnaike Kumaratunga, blew the whistle whenever Pakistan crossed the 'Lakshman-rekha' of the SAARC Charter. In fact at Bentota yesterday she had stopped short of showing the ""yellow card"" to Mr Nawaz Sharif.

SAARC’s emphasis on economic relations and its appreciation of steps being taken by India to push the fast-forward button in the movement from the present preferential trade arrangement to free trade in South Asia (and in the interregnum, offer of bilateral free trade with those who want it) have been major achievements during Mr Vajpayee’s maiden trip to foreign shores.

On the bilateral plane, though, Mr Vajpayee seems to have misjudged the mood of Mr Sharif. As the Foreign Secretary-level talks could not produce a definite result in two days, Pakistan, in a statement, suggested that the announcement of the talks had been done ""unilaterally"" by Mr Vajpayee. (India, however, did not argue with this formulation.)

The Pakistani statement issued here today said: ""The dialogue remains stalemated and no progress has been made in Colombo"". The statement added: ""At the heart of the problem lies the rigid and inflexible position which India continues to maintain in its refusal to address the issues of peace and security and Jammu and Kashmir dispute"".

To make the matters worse, the Pakistani spokesman today circulated to the media a ""non-paper"" by Pakistan on confidence building measures in Jammu and Kashmir, which said:

""We proposed the following confidence building measures with a view to bringing about relaxation of tensions in Jammu and Kashmir: (a) the strengthening of UNMOGIP and authority to patrol on both sides of the LoC, with regular reports to the UN Security Council; (b) the release of Kashmiri detainees; (c) the removal of Indian army pickets in Srinagar and other Kashmiri towns and villages; (d) the phased reduction of Indian troops from IHK’s towns and villages; (e) the cessation of search/arrest operations; (f) the transmission of information about ‘missing persons’ in IHK; (g) the stationing of ICRC and UN human rights monitors in IHK; (h) the recognition of All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) as legitimate Kashmiri representative"".

It further said: ""India should consider the above suggestions in the context of efforts towards seriously addressing the Jammu and Kashmir issue, which is the core problem between Pakistan and India"".

India reacted calmy. A two-page statement released by Foreign Secretary, Mr K. Raghunath, said: ""An obsessive focus on a single issue or a one-point agenda is as neurotic for individuals as for nation states"".

For India, the Colombo Declaration issued by the 10th SAARC summit had been a decisive victory not only in the region, but in the global perspective. Categorically taking note of India’s irreducible security concerns, the Colombo Declaration also in effect endorsed India’s position on the NPT and the CTBT and echoed India’s Rajiv Gandhi vintage demand for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons.

Pakistan’s bid for a peace, security and development initiative for South Asia failed to take off at all. This, coupled with the SAARC’s endorsement of India’s irreducible security concerns (that nuclear weapons with China pose a threat; that the nuclear ""haves"" must talk of the CTBT and the NPT on equal terms, not from a position of advantage) was reflected in paragraph 78 of the Colombo Declaration, which said:

""The Heads of State of Government were of the view that stability, peace and security in South Asia could not be considered in isolation of the global security environment. Although great power rivalry which the NAM had consistently opposed, no longer posed a serious threat and the danger of a global nuclear conflagration had abated yet some states had sought to maintain huge arsenals of nuclear weapons. The NPT and the CTBT, to which some SAARC members were signatories, had not led to any progress towards nuclear disarmament nor prevented proliferation. They underscored their commitment to the complete elimination of nuclear weapons and the need for promoting nuclear disarmament on a universal basis, under effective international control. They recognised that global non-proliferation goals cannot be achieved in the absence of progress towards nuclear disarmament and in this context called upon all nuclear weapon states, whether party or non-party to the NPT engage constructively through a transparent and credible process of negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament"".

The stalemate in Indo-Pak bilateral talks thus has to be viewed in the total perspective. Before Mr Nawaz Sharif embarked on his Colombo trip, he had a major reverse at home: the Pakistan Supreme Court questioned the justification behind suspension of fundamental rights under the emergency declared by Mr Sharif’s government in the aftermath of nuclear blasts. The Pakistan Supreme Court felt that financial emergency need not be accompanied by the suspension of fundamental rights.

Hence, Mr Sharif was besieged at home; he did not find any talkers for his line in Colombo (or during the retreat at Bentota). The atmosphere for creating a situation other than a stalemate, therefore, did not exist in Colombo when India and Pakistan got down to negotiations.

There is a silver lining: while announcing failure of the talks, the Pakistani spokesman said two things:

""It is expected that the two Prime Ministers will have their next meeting at the sidelines of the NAM summit in Durban, South Africa"".
""We hope that the two sides will remain in touch through diplomatic channels to overcome the difficulties and resumption of the dialogue"".
India and Pakistan, thus, have agreed to disagree. They have not said ""no"" to talks. India would like the talks to be bilateral; Pakistan is itching for the third party intervention.

India wants a ""broad-based and composite"" dialogue. As Mr Raghunath put it, ""serious discussions can take place on foundations which are realistic and not on the basis of fantasies"".

""Engaging in dialogue itself is a forward movement"", the Foreign Secretary said and emphasised that there was no place for interlocutors. ""There is no place for involvement of any party, whether call it mediation or use any other term"", he clarified.

Thus, Colombo has not been the venue for a thaw in India-Pakistan relations. Yet there is hope. Free India and Pakistan owe their existence as independent nation states to developments in Durban, South Africa, from where the journey of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi began. Though Pakistan was born against the Mahatma’s wishes, in today’s reality, perhaps, both India and Pakistan can look to Durban with hope.","The two-leg India-Pakistan diplomatic efforts in Colombo have concluded, with India making strides in the multilateral SAARC summit while the bilateral talks between Prime Ministers Atal Behari Vajpayee and Nawaz Sharif have reached a stalemate.

C'Swami's role to be probed
Jain report tabled in Parliament

NEW DELHI, July 31 (PTI) — The Jain Commission has said ""a doubt does arise"" about the complicity and involvement of Chandraswami in the conspiracy to assassinate Rajiv Gandhi while the government announced that a specialised agency would probe the panel’s comments in regard to Chandraswami, Janata Party president Subramanian Swamy and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi.

The final report of the panel, headed by former Delhi High Court Chief Justice Milap Chand Jain which probed the conspiracy behind the killing of the former Premier nearly seven years ago, was placed on the table of both Houses of Parliament along with the government’s action taken report (ATR).

The government announced the setting up of a multi-disciplinary monitoring agency (mdma) in the CBI to monitor the movements of all accused in the case who were still absconding and undertake further probe into the activities of those against whom doubts had been raised in the final report.

The panel said ""taking the entire evidence, material and circumstances brought on record into consideration, a doubt does arise regarding Chandraswami’s complicity and involvement and the matter requires further probe.""

On Mr Karunanidhi, the ATR said it entrusted the mdma with the responsibility to decide how to proceed further in the matter.","The Jain Commission's final report on the conspiracy behind the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi has raised doubts about the complicity and involvement of Chandraswami, a spiritual leader.

On the other hand, rainfall has been below normal by 9 per cent in Himachal Pradesh while it has been 63 per cent above normal in the Union Territory of Chandigarh.

The first two months of the monsoon season ended today and the figures have been updated till yesterday, the local meteorological office said. In certain pockets of Haryana like Rohtak and Bhiwani the rain has been a shade below normal. It is 21mm below normal in Rohtak district. Same is true for Faridkot district in Punjab where it has been 34 mm less that usual.

On the other hand, Kurukshetra with 623 mm of rain is 393 mm in excess and Patiala, with 383 mm of rain is 128 mm in excess. Both towns top the list in Haryana and Punjab, respectively. The maximum deficiency recorded in the north western region is in Mandi, where the rainfall has been 302 mm below its normal quota of 635 mm.

Taking an average for the entire Punjab till July 30 the met office has calculated that the state received 290 mm of rain while the normal rainfall was 218 mm. In Haryana, the average rainfall throughout the state has been 326 mm while the normal level is 214 i.e 52 per cent in excess.

In Himachal, the rain has been 9 per cent in shortfall . The actual rainfall has been 383 mm while the normal quota should have been 419 mm in HP, the met office said. Despite the shortfall Dharamsala had received 1162 mm of rain i.e 60 mm above normal.

Explaining the phenomena how rainfall was not so widespread the met office said that it is not necessary that widespread rain will occur each time clouds form in one area. Thus below normal rain is being recorded even in Himachal officials explained. In Himachal rain has been below normal at almost all major stations . Figures ended July 29 indicate that Shimla, Mandi, Solan, Chamba and Hamirpur, among others, are falling behind on average rainfall.

Though some of these stations are listed as normal in the met parlance the rainfall is below normal. The meteorological department figures are taken as ""normal rain"" if rainfall is 19 per cent above or below normal. Rain is classified as excess if it is 20 per cent or more than normal. Deficient is classified when rainfall is between 22 per cent and 59 per cent below normal.

In Punjab towns like Gurdaspur, Hoshiarpur and Ludhiana have recorded rainfall above normal and is said to be good for the crops. Same is true for towns of Karnal, Gurgaon, Faridabad and Ambala, among other places.

The Union Territory of Chandigarh has been receiving very sharp showers at irregular intervals but there has been no long spell of rain which would usually carry on for a day or two. The same thing happened today when the city received very sharp showers but within two hours the sun was shining brightly.

The weather office explained that the cloud burst was due to no big organised formations of clouds.

Although great power rivalry which the NAM had consistently opposed, no longer posed a serious threat and the danger of a global nuclear conflagration had abated yet some states had sought to maintain huge arsenals of nuclear weapons. The NPT and the CTBT, to which some SAARC members were signatories, had not led to any progress towards nuclear disarmament nor prevented proliferation. They underscored their commitment to the complete elimination of nuclear weapons and the need for promoting nuclear disarmament on a universal basis, under effective international control. They recognised that global non-proliferation goals cannot be achieved in the absence of progress towards nuclear disarmament and in this context called upon all nuclear weapon states, whether party or non-party to the NPT engage constructively through a transparent and credible process of negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament"".

The stalemate in Indo-Pak bilateral talks thus has to be viewed in the total perspective. Before Mr Nawaz Sharif embarked on his Colombo trip, he had a major reverse at home: the Pakistan Supreme Court questioned the justification behind suspension of fundamental rights under the emergency declared by Mr Sharif’s government in the aftermath of nuclear blasts. The Pakistan Supreme Court felt that financial emergency need not be accompanied by the suspension of fundamental rights.

Hence, Mr Sharif was besieged at home; he did not find any talkers for his line in Colombo (or during the retreat at Bentota). The atmosphere for creating a situation other than a stalemate, therefore, did not exist in Colombo when India and Pakistan got down to negotiations.

There is a silver lining: while announcing failure of the talks, the Pakistani spokesman said two things:

""It is expected that the two Prime Ministers will have their next meeting at the sidelines of the NAM summit in Durban, South Africa"".
""We hope that the two sides will remain in touch through diplomatic channels to overcome the difficulties and resumption of the dialogue"".
India and Pakistan, thus, have agreed to disagree. They have not said ""no"" to talks. India would like the talks to be bilateral; Pakistan is itching for the third party intervention.

India wants a ""broad-based and composite"" dialogue. As Mr Raghunath put it, ""serious discussions can take place on foundations which are realistic and not on the basis of fantasies"".

""Engaging in dialogue itself is a forward movement"", the Foreign Secretary said and emphasised that there was no place for interlocutors. ""There is no place for involvement of any party, whether call it mediation or use any other term"", he clarified.

Thus, Colombo has not been the venue for a thaw in India-Pakistan relations. Yet there is hope. Free India and Pakistan owe their existence as independent nation states to developments in Durban, South Africa, from where the journey of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi began. Though Pakistan was born against the Mahatma’s wishes, in today’s reality, perhaps, both India and Pakistan can look to Durban with hope.","
The India-Pakistan diplomatic showdown in Colombo concluded with a significant outcome at the multilateral SAARC summit, where India showcased its ability to keep political issues at bay. However, on the bilateral front, talks between Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif ended in a stalemate. While India received praise for its economic initiatives and commitment to regional stability, Pakistan accused India of maintaining a rigid position on issues like peace, security, and the Kashmir dispute. The talks failed to produce concrete results, and Pakistan circulated a document proposing confidence-building measures in Jammu and Kashmir. Despite the setback, there is a silver lining as both countries expressed the intention to remain in touch through diplomatic channels. The next meeting between the Prime Ministers is expected at the sidelines of the NAM summit in Durban, South Africa.",International News,139,1211
The Tribune,1998-08-01 00:00:00,Supreme Court stays HC order on traffic regulations,"CHANDIGARH, July 31 — The Supreme Court today stayed the operation of the order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court of July 9, 1998, through which various directions were issued to the Governments of Punjab and Haryana, besides the Chandigarh Administration, for regulating vehicular traffic and pollution control.

The order of the apex court followed a special leave petition (SLP) filed by the Chandigarh Administration.

The administration maintained that the petition raised substantial questions of law of general public importance. These questions included whether the high court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 226 could have overlooked and ignored the provisions of law and given directions in complete violation of these provisions of law, including the Motor Vehicles Act, Capital of Punjab (Development and Regulation) Act, and rules framed thereunder.

Whether the high court was justified in giving a direction to be implemented fort with, thus taking away the right of appeal of the petitioner, especially when an application was moved by the administration before the high court for grant of time for filing an appeal against the impugned judgement. In the SLP, the administration maintained that its officers had been called repeatedly to explain as to why the directions had not been complied with. The court later granted time up to today (July 31) and had called the officers on August 3 for apprising the court of the directions having been complied with or not.

The administration also questioned whether the high court had not committed a grave error in imposing its own pre-conceived notions and prejudices regarding urban planning and road planning in particular? For example, the SLP said, its order to make radical and totally unimplementable changes in the lay out, structure and road planning of the city, while overruling expert advice in making recommendations such as that one-way traffic shall be introduced virtually throughout the city, even though the city was planned on the basis of the inter-sectoral roads called V-3 roads and V-2 roads (major city thoroughfares), V-4 roads (commercial streets with shops deliberately kept on one side of the road behind a parking space), V-5 roads (being loop roads inside each sector) providing access to the lesser. It was improbable that there was any such city in the world consisting almost entirely of one-way roads as required by the high court.

The same question, the administration said, applied also to the directions that side lanes should be provided without exception to all ""main roads"" of Chandigarh, without even defining which category of roads were main roads for this purpose.","The Supreme Court has stayed the operation of the Punjab and Haryana High Court's order from July 9, 1998, which issued various directions to the governments of Punjab and Haryana, as well as the Chandigarh Administration, for regulating vehicular traffic and pollution control.

The Tribune,1998-08-01 00:00:00,Indo-Pak talks end in a stalemate,"The two-leg India-Pakistan showdown in Colombo has ended with India underscoring its points in the multilateral leg, namely, the 10th SAARC summit, whereas in the bilateral leg, despite show of mutual warmth by Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee and Mr Nawaz Sharif on Wednesday, a stalemate, resulting in a ""washout"" has been the result.

Use of cricketing parlance may not be out of place while this despatch is being filed from the land of the world champions, Sri Lanka. In the recent Singer Cup, matches were washed out by rain. Though the weather was minus downpours for the three days of the summit (it was mostly sunny), in both multilateral and bilateral legs, India and Pakistan could not come to a conclusion.

In the multilateral front, India can look back to Colombo with pride. Its penchant for keeping political issues at bay was appreciated and the SAARC Chairperson, Mrs Chandrika Bandarnaike Kumaratunga, blew the whistle whenever Pakistan crossed the 'Lakshman-rekha' of the SAARC Charter. In fact at Bentota yesterday she had stopped short of showing the ""yellow card"" to Mr Nawaz Sharif.

SAARC’s emphasis on economic relations and its appreciation of steps being taken by India to push the fast-forward button in the movement from the present preferential trade arrangement to free trade in South Asia (and in the interregnum, offer of bilateral free trade with those who want it) have been major achievements during Mr Vajpayee’s maiden trip to foreign shores.

On the bilateral plane, though, Mr Vajpayee seems to have misjudged the mood of Mr Sharif. As the Foreign Secretary-level talks could not produce a definite result in two days, Pakistan, in a statement, suggested that the announcement of the talks had been done ""unilaterally"" by Mr Vajpayee. (India, however, did not argue with this formulation.)

The Pakistani statement issued here today said: ""The dialogue remains stalemated and no progress has been made in Colombo"". The statement added: ""At the heart of the problem lies the rigid and inflexible position which India continues to maintain in its refusal to address the issues of peace and security and Jammu and Kashmir dispute"".

To make the matters worse, the Pakistani spokesman today circulated to the media a ""non-paper"" by Pakistan on confidence building measures in Jammu and Kashmir, which said:

""We proposed the following confidence building measures with a view to bringing about relaxation of tensions in Jammu and Kashmir: (a) the strengthening of UNMOGIP and authority to patrol on both sides of the LoC, with regular reports to the UN Security Council; (b) the release of Kashmiri detainees; (c) the removal of Indian army pickets in Srinagar and other Kashmiri towns and villages; (d) the phased reduction of Indian troops from IHK’s towns and villages; (e) the cessation of search/arrest operations; (f) the transmission of information about ‘missing persons’ in IHK; (g) the stationing of ICRC and UN human rights monitors in IHK; (h) the recognition of All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) as legitimate Kashmiri representative"".

It further said: ""India should consider the above suggestions in the context of efforts towards seriously addressing the Jammu and Kashmir issue, which is the core problem between Pakistan and India"".

India reacted calmy. A two-page statement released by Foreign Secretary, Mr K. Raghunath, said: ""An obsessive focus on a single issue or a one-point agenda is as neurotic for individuals as for nation states"".

For India, the Colombo Declaration issued by the 10th SAARC summit had been a decisive victory not only in the region, but in the global perspective. Categorically taking note of India’s irreducible security concerns, the Colombo Declaration also in effect endorsed India’s position on the NPT and the CTBT and echoed India’s Rajiv Gandhi vintage demand for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons.

Pakistan’s bid for a peace, security and development initiative for South Asia failed to take off at all. This, coupled with the SAARC’s endorsement of India’s irreducible security concerns (that nuclear weapons with China pose a threat; that the nuclear ""haves"" must talk of the CTBT and the NPT on equal terms, not from a position of advantage) was reflected in paragraph 78 of the Colombo Declaration, which said:

The Tribune,1998-08-01 00:00:00,National hero unsung in hometown,"SUNAM (Sangrur), July 31 — This town which once did not own its martyr Udham Singh, still finds it difficult to come to terms with his legacy.

While the people of Sunam disowned Udham Singh after he shot dead Michael O'Dyer at whose behest thousands of innocent people were killed at Jallianwala Bagh, they quarrelled over how he should be depicted and eventually erected two statues showing him as a Hindu and a Sikh, respectively.

The government, which did not want to be involved in the quarrel, erected a Flame of Liberty at the stadium here. It was here that Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal and other people paid their respects to the martyr today.

The compounds of both statues, erected around 200 metres from each other, were bereft of any people today nor did the public pay obeisance at the two memorials.

Many people feel the controversy generated by erecting two kinds of statues has besmirched the lofty stands of secularism espoused by Udham Singh who called himself Ram Mohammad Singh Azad. They feel the controversy should be ended once and for all and a separate befitting memorial be constructed in the martyr's honour.

However, despite more than 30 years having passed since the construction of the statues, old sores remain. Vipan Kumar, a shopkeeper, claimed the issue was needlessly given a religious colour as the first statue was only an attempt to portray Udham Singh as he was arrested in London. However, another lobby feels a deliberate attempt was made to prove that Udham Singh was a Hindu which was untrue and could not be accepted.

The controversy started when Udham Singh's ashes were brought to Sunam in July, 1974. While a part of the ashes was kept at the local Shaheed Udham Singh College, other parts were immersed in the Ganga at Hardwar and at Kiratpur Sahib, besides being sent to the Jallianwala Bagh and the dargah at Sirhind. However the quarrel started when it was first decided that a statue of him as shown in photographs wearing a hat and suit when arrested after shooting Michael O'Dyer be constructed.

Though an attempt was made to arrive at a consensus by adding a Hindu-style turban and moustaches to the statue, another statue depicting the martyr with a turban and beard was also erected soon after.

There are also discrepancies in the two memorials. While the memorial depicting him as a Hindu proclaims his date of birth as 1889, that in which he is depicted as a Sikh has his date of birth as 1899. In the Flame of Liberty memorial, the date of birth is given as 1903.

Jagan Nath Sandha, who has penned a book on Udham Singh, has said that the controversy over the statues was raised for vested interests. He says little did people remember that Udham Singh had himself said,"" Na mein dharam ke bandhan mein hun, na mein mazhab ke kayal hun, mera to desh Bharat hai, sada iska mein sheda hun.""","Sunam, a town in Sangrur, Punjab, faced controversy and internal quarrels over the depiction of Udham Singh, the martyr who shot Michael O'Dyer at Jallianwala Bagh. The people of Sunam disowned Udham Singh initially, and when statues were erected to honor him, two different ones were created, depicting him as a Hindu and a Sikh. The controversy still lingers, and some feel that the issue should be resolved by constructing a single, fitting memorial for Udham Singh, who espoused secularism during his lifetime.",Lifestyle and Features,83,500

While the people of Sunam disowned Udham Singh after he shot dead Michael O'Dyer at whose behest thousands of innocent people were killed at Jallianwala Bagh, they quarrelled over how he should be depicted and eventually erected two statues showing him as a Hindu and a Sikh, respectively.

The government, which did not want to be involved in the quarrel, erected a Flame of Liberty at the stadium here. It was here that Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal and other people paid their respects to the martyr today.

The compounds of both statues, erected around 200 metres from each other, were bereft of any people today nor did the public pay obeisance at the two memorials.

Many people feel the controversy generated by erecting two kinds of statues has besmirched the lofty stands of secularism espoused by Udham Singh who called himself Ram Mohammad Singh Azad. They feel the controversy should be ended once and for all and a separate befitting memorial be constructed in the martyr's honour.

However, despite more than 30 years having passed since the construction of the statues, old sores remain. Vipan Kumar, a shopkeeper, claimed the issue was needlessly given a religious colour as the first statue was only an attempt to portray Udham Singh as he was arrested in London. However, another lobby feels a deliberate attempt was made to prove that Udham Singh was a Hindu which was untrue and could not be accepted.

The controversy started when Udham Singh's ashes were brought to Sunam in July, 1974. While a part of the ashes was kept at the local Shaheed Udham Singh College, other parts were immersed in the Ganga at Hardwar and at Kiratpur Sahib, besides being sent to the Jallianwala Bagh and the dargah at Sirhind. However the quarrel started when it was first decided that a statue of him as shown in photographs wearing a hat and suit when arrested after shooting Michael O'Dyer be constructed.

Though an attempt was made to arrive at a consensus by adding a Hindu-style turban and moustaches to the statue, another statue depicting the martyr with a turban and beard was also erected soon after.

There are also discrepancies in the two memorials. While the memorial depicting him as a Hindu proclaims his date of birth as 1889, that in which he is depicted as a Sikh has his date of birth as 1899. In the Flame of Liberty memorial, the date of birth is given as 1903.

Jagan Nath Sandha, who has penned a book on Udham Singh, has said that the controversy over the statues was raised for vested interests. He says little did people remember that Udham Singh had himself said,"" Na mein dharam ke bandhan mein hun, na mein mazhab ke kayal hun, mera to desh Bharat hai, sada iska mein sheda hun.""","The town of Sunam struggles with Udham Singh's legacy, once disowned for avenging Jallianwala Bagh. Statues, depicting him as Hindu and Sikh, fuel the controversy. Despite calls for a unified memorial, discord persists after 30 years. The dispute began when his ashes arrived in 1974. Efforts to reconcile failed, leading to conflicting statues and birth dates. Sandha highlights Udham Singh's secular stance, ""I'm neither bound by religion nor its follower, my country is India, and I'm forever its servant."" The dispute reflects vested interests, tarnishing the martyr's legacy.",Local News,88,495
The Tribune,1998-08-01 00:00:00,Supreme Court stays HC order on traffic regulations,"The Supreme Court today stayed the operation of the order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court of July 9, 1998, through which various directions were issued to the Governments of Punjab and Haryana, besides the Chandigarh Administration, for regulating vehicular traffic and pollution control.

The order of the apex court followed a special leave petition (SLP) filed by the Chandigarh Administration.

The administration maintained that the petition raised substantial questions of law of general public importance. These questions included whether the high court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 226 could have overlooked and ignored the provisions of law and given directions in complete violation of these provisions of law, including the Motor Vehicles Act, Capital of Punjab (Development and Regulation) Act, and rules framed thereunder.

Whether the high court was justified in giving a direction to be implemented fort with, thus taking away the right of appeal of the petitioner, especially when an application was moved by the administration before the high court for grant of time for filing an appeal against the impugned judgement. In the SLP, the administration maintained that its officers had been called repeatedly to explain as to why the directions had not been complied with. The court later granted time up to today (July 31) and had called the officers on August 3 for apprising the court of the directions having been complied with or not.

The administration also questioned whether the high court had not committed a grave error in imposing its own pre-conceived notions and prejudices regarding urban planning and road planning in particular? For example, the SLP said, its order to make radical and totally unimplementable changes in the lay out, structure and road planning of the city, while overruling expert advice in making recommendations such as that one-way traffic shall be introduced virtually throughout the city, even though the city was planned on the basis of the inter-sectoral roads called V-3 roads and V-2 roads (major city thoroughfares), V-4 roads (commercial streets with shops deliberately kept on one side of the road behind a parking space), V-5 roads (being loop roads inside each sector) providing access to the lesser. It was improbable that there was any such city in the world consisting almost entirely of one-way roads as required by the high court.

The same question, the administration said, applied also to the directions that side lanes should be provided without exception to all ""main roads"" of Chandigarh, without even defining which category of roads were main roads for this purpose.","The Supreme Court stayed the Punjab and Haryana High Court's order from July 9, 1998, on traffic regulation and pollution control following a petition by the Chandigarh Administration. The petition raised concerns regarding the high court's jurisdiction and its imposition of unfeasible changes in urban planning. It questioned the legality of directions that ignored established laws and overruled expert advice, such as mandating extensive one-way traffic and side lanes without defining main roads. The administration emphasized the importance of upholding legal procedures and addressing the practicality of implementing court directives.",Crime and Justice,90,423
The Tribune,1998-08-01 00:00:00,"Monsoon over Punjab, Haryana above normal","This year's monsoon over Punjab and Haryana is above normal by 33 per cent and 52 per cent, respectively. On the other hand, rainfall has been below normal by 9 per cent in Himachal Pradesh while it has been 63 per cent above normal in the Union Territory of Chandigarh.

The first two months of the monsoon season ended today and the figures have been updated till yesterday, the local meteorological office said. In certain pockets of Haryana like Rohtak and Bhiwani the rain has been a shade below normal. It is 21mm below normal in Rohtak district. Same is true for Faridkot district in Punjab where it has been 34 mm less that usual.

On the other hand, Kurukshetra with 623 mm of rain is 393 mm in excess and Patiala, with 383 mm of rain is 128 mm in excess. Both towns top the list in Haryana and Punjab, respectively. The maximum deficiency recorded in the north western region is in Mandi, where the rainfall has been 302 mm below its normal quota of 635 mm.

Taking an average for the entire Punjab till July 30 the met office has calculated that the state received 290 mm of rain while the normal rainfall was 218 mm. In Haryana, the average rainfall throughout the state has been 326 mm while the normal level is 214 i.e 52 per cent in excess.

In Himachal, the rain has been 9 per cent in shortfall . The actual rainfall has been 383 mm while the normal quota should have been 419 mm in HP, the met office said. Despite the shortfall Dharamsala had received 1162 mm of rain i.e 60 mm above normal.

Explaining the phenomena how rainfall was not so widespread the met office said that it is not necessary that widespread rain will occur each time clouds form in one area. Thus below normal rain is being recorded even in Himachal officials explained. In Himachal rain has been below normal at almost all major stations . Figures ended July 29 indicate that Shimla, Mandi, Solan, Chamba and Hamirpur, among others, are falling behind on average rainfall.

Though some of these stations are listed as normal in the met parlance the rainfall is below normal. The meteorological department figures are taken as ""normal rain"" if rainfall is 19 per cent above or below normal. Rain is classified as excess if it is 20 per cent or more than normal. Deficient is classified when rainfall is between 22 per cent and 59 per cent below normal.

In Punjab towns like Gurdaspur, Hoshiarpur and Ludhiana have recorded rainfall above normal and is said to be good for the crops. Same is true for towns of Karnal, Gurgaon, Faridabad and Ambala, among other places.

The Union Territory of Chandigarh has been receiving very sharp showers at irregular intervals but there has been no long spell of rain which would usually carry on for a day or two. The same thing happened today when the city received very sharp showers but within two hours the sun was shining brightly.

The weather office explained that the cloud burst was due to no big organised formations of clouds. Changes like these happen routinely when rainfall is not uniform, however, moisture is there in the atmosphere.","This year's monsoon in Punjab and Haryana is above normal by 33% and 52%, respectively, while Himachal Pradesh experiences a 9% deficit. Chandigarh sees a 63% surplus. Certain pockets in Haryana and Punjab have slightly below normal rainfall. The maximum deficiency is in Mandi, Himachal Pradesh. Punjab towns like Gurdaspur, Ludhiana, and Hoshiarpur have above-normal rainfall. Chandigarh experiences sharp but irregular showers. The weather office attributes the variability to the absence of large organized cloud formations. Despite disparities, moisture remains in the atmosphere.",Weather,83,548
The Tribune,1998-08-01 00:00:00,Indo-Pak talks end in a stalemate," The two-leg India-Pakistan showdown in Colombo has ended with India underscoring its points in the multilateral leg, namely, the 10th SAARC summit, whereas in the bilateral leg, despite show of mutual warmth by Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee and Mr Nawaz Sharif on Wednesday, a stalemate, resulting in a ""washout"" has been the result.

Use of cricketing parlance may not be out of place while this despatch is being filed from the land of the world champions, Sri Lanka. In the recent Singer Cup, matches were washed out by rain. Though the weather was minus downpours for the three days of the summit (it was mostly sunny), in both multilateral and bilateral legs, India and Pakistan could not come to a conclusion.

In the multilateral front, India can look back to Colombo with pride. Its penchant for keeping political issues at bay was appreciated and the SAARC Chairperson, Mrs Chandrika Bandarnaike Kumaratunga, blew the whistle whenever Pakistan crossed the 'Lakshman-rekha' of the SAARC Charter. In fact at Bentota yesterday she had stopped short of showing the ""yellow card"" to Mr Nawaz Sharif.

SAARC’s emphasis on economic relations and its appreciation of steps being taken by India to push the fast-forward button in the movement from the present preferential trade arrangement to free trade in South Asia (and in the interregnum, offer of bilateral free trade with those who want it) have been major achievements during Mr Vajpayee’s maiden trip to foreign shores.

On the bilateral plane, though, Mr Vajpayee seems to have misjudged the mood of Mr Sharif. As the Foreign Secretary-level talks could not produce a definite result in two days, Pakistan, in a statement, suggested that the announcement of the talks had been done ""unilaterally"" by Mr Vajpayee. (India, however, did not argue with this formulation.)

The Pakistani statement issued here today said: ""The dialogue remains stalemated and no progress has been made in Colombo"". The statement added: ""At the heart of the problem lies the rigid and inflexible position which India continues to maintain in its refusal to address the issues of peace and security and Jammu and Kashmir dispute"".

To make the matters worse, the Pakistani spokesman today circulated to the media a ""non-paper"" by Pakistan on confidence building measures in Jammu and Kashmir, which said:

""We proposed the following confidence building measures with a view to bringing about relaxation of tensions in Jammu and Kashmir: (a) the strengthening of UNMOGIP and authority to patrol on both sides of the LoC, with regular reports to the UN Security Council; (b) the release of Kashmiri detainees; (c) the removal of Indian army pickets in Srinagar and other Kashmiri towns and villages; (d) the phased reduction of Indian troops from IHK’s towns and villages; (e) the cessation of search/arrest operations; (f) the transmission of information about ‘missing persons’ in IHK; (g) the stationing of ICRC and UN human rights monitors in IHK; (h) the recognition of All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) as legitimate Kashmiri representative"".

It further said: ""India should consider the above suggestions in the context of efforts towards seriously addressing the Jammu and Kashmir issue, which is the core problem between Pakistan and India"".

India reacted calmy. A two-page statement released by Foreign Secretary, Mr K. Raghunath, said: ""An obsessive focus on a single issue or a one-point agenda is as neurotic for individuals as for nation states"".

For India, the Colombo Declaration issued by the 10th SAARC summit had been a decisive victory not only in the region, but in the global perspective. Categorically taking note of India’s irreducible security concerns, the Colombo Declaration also in effect endorsed India’s position on the NPT and the CTBT and echoed India’s Rajiv Gandhi vintage demand for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons.

Pakistan’s bid for a peace, security and development initiative for South Asia failed to take off at all. This, coupled with the SAARC’s endorsement of India’s irreducible security concerns (that nuclear weapons with China pose a threat; that the nuclear ""haves"" must talk of the CTBT and the NPT on equal terms, not from a position of advantage) was reflected in paragraph 78 of the Colombo Declaration, which said:

""The Heads of State of Government were of the view that stability, peace and security in South Asia could not be considered in isolation of the global security environment. Although great power rivalry which the NAM had consistently opposed, no longer posed a serious threat and the danger of a global nuclear conflagration had abated yet some states had sought to maintain huge arsenals of nuclear weapons. The NPT and the CTBT, to which some SAARC members were signatories, had not led to any progress towards nuclear disarmament nor prevented proliferation. They underscored their commitment to the complete elimination of nuclear weapons and the need for promoting nuclear disarmament on a universal basis, under effective international control. They recognised that global non-proliferation goals cannot be achieved in the absence of progress towards nuclear disarmament and in this context called upon all nuclear weapon states, whether party or non-party to the NPT engage constructively through a transparent and credible process of negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament"".

The stalemate in Indo-Pak bilateral talks thus has to be viewed in the total perspective. Before Mr Nawaz Sharif embarked on his Colombo trip, he had a major reverse at home: the Pakistan Supreme Court questioned the justification behind suspension of fundamental rights under the emergency declared by Mr Sharif’s government in the aftermath of nuclear blasts. The Pakistan Supreme Court felt that financial emergency need not be accompanied by the suspension of fundamental rights.

Hence, Mr Sharif was besieged at home; he did not find any talkers for his line in Colombo (or during the retreat at Bentota). The atmosphere for creating a situation other than a stalemate, therefore, did not exist in Colombo when India and Pakistan got down to negotiations.

There is a silver lining: while announcing failure of the talks, the Pakistani spokesman said two things:

""It is expected that the two Prime Ministers will have their next meeting at the sidelines of the NAM summit in Durban, South Africa"".
""We hope that the two sides will remain in touch through diplomatic channels to overcome the difficulties and resumption of the dialogue"".
India and Pakistan, thus, have agreed to disagree. They have not said ""no"" to talks. India would like the talks to be bilateral; Pakistan is itching for the third party intervention.

India wants a ""broad-based and composite"" dialogue. As Mr Raghunath put it, ""serious discussions can take place on foundations which are realistic and not on the basis of fantasies"".

""Engaging in dialogue itself is a forward movement"", the Foreign Secretary said and emphasised that there was no place for interlocutors. ""There is no place for involvement of any party, whether call it mediation or use any other term"", he clarified.

Thus, Colombo has not been the venue for a thaw in India-Pakistan relations. Yet there is hope. Free India and Pakistan owe their existence as independent nation states to developments in Durban, South Africa, from where the journey of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi began. Though Pakistan was born against the Mahatma’s wishes, in today’s reality, perhaps, both India and Pakistan can look to Durban with hope.","The India-Pakistan diplomatic engagement in Colombo ended with a stalemate despite warm gestures. India succeeded at the SAARC summit but faced deadlock in bilateral talks. Pakistan proposed confidence-building measures for Kashmir, met with India's calm response. The Colombo Declaration reflected India's security concerns and nuclear disarmament stance. Pakistan's internal challenges added to the impasse. Both nations left room for future dialogue, agreeing to disagree. India favored bilateral talks, rejecting third-party intervention. While Colombo didn't thaw relations, hope remains for progress, with future talks anticipated at the NAM summit. Durban, where Gandhi's journey began, symbolizes potential for Indo-Pak peace efforts.",National News,99,1211

The Tribune,1998-08-02 00:00:00,Centre warned against toppling DMK govt,"Tamil Nadu Chief Minister, Mr M. Karunanidhi, today termed as ""politically motivated"" the Centre’s decision to refer observations about him in the Jain Commission’s report to a multi-disciplinary monitoring agency and said, ""If the BJP-led coalition attempts to dig a grave for the DMK government by using the report, it will itself fall into it.""
""Do not stir a hornet’s nest,"" the DMK president said, rejecting the action taken report (ATR) on the findings of the commission, which investigated the conspiracy aspect of the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case. The commission’s final report along with the ATR was tabled in Parliament by the Home Minister, Mr L.K. Advani, yesterday.

""The Centre’s decision is a political trickery to disturb my government at the instigation of AIADMK supremo Ms Jayalalitha and we will face it politically,"" Mr Karunanidhi said at a press conference here.

On the commission’s observation that he had not been interrogated by the Special Investigation Team (SIT), he said he had deposed before Justice M.C. Jain for five full days and was also cross-examined by Tamizhaga Rajiv Congress leader Vahapadi Ramamurthy and AIADMK advocate. Justice Jain had not said anything against him during the deposition, he added.

""Even now, Jain has not indicted me. The Centre’s decision is to malign me and my party. I will face it politically,"" Mr Karunanidhi said.

The Centre should come out with the ‘misgivings’ expressed by Justice Jain in his final report, he said and claimed that the commission had not indicted him at all in the final report.

He questioned the need for an ATR on the commission’s findings, saying the United Front Government had already placed an ATR on the interim report. (The UF’s ATR had rejected the findings in the interim report that the DMK had given tacit support to the LTTE.)

Mr Karunanidhi also rejected Ms Jayalalitha’s demand for his resignation on the issue.

The commission had not singled him out for not being interrogated by the SIT, he said and added that Justice Jain had also stated that Chandra Shekhar, T.N. Seshan, Dr Subramanian Swamy, Ms Jayalalitha and Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao were not interrogated.

The then CBI director, Mr Vijay Karan, had stated that there was no need to interrogate him (Karunanidhi).

When the commission had made no mention about him in its final report, where was the need for his interrogation by the agency, he questioned.

Asked if he would subject himself to an interrogation by a central agency, he said: ""Let us cross the bridge when it comes.""

When his comments were sought on the Centre’s decision to probe the Chandraswami’s and Dr Subramanian Swamy’s alleged role in the conspiracy to assassinate Rajiv Gandhi, he said, ""No comments. Ask anything about me and I will reply.""

Mr Karunanidhi said Dr Swamy had alleged before the commission that Ms Jayalalitha had helped LTTE volunteers to reach Sriperumbudur. ""The same Swamy is her political advisor now,"" he said.

The Centre had set a ""bad precedent"" by tabling an ATR for the report when the UF government had already tabled one on it earlier.

""This will only enable any future government to revise ATRs filed by previous governments which is not good,"" Mr Karunanidhi said.

Earlier, the DMK’s General Council, which began its two-day sitting here, in a resolution rejected the ATR terming it as ‘politically motivated’.

The Centre’s decision to refer the ""observation"" on Mr Karunanidhi to the agency was purely on ""an imagination that the commission had some observation,"" it said. The Centre’s action was ""only to satisfy"" somebody, it alleged.

The DMK rejected the Centre’s decision to ask the proposed multi-disciplinary monitoring agency on how to proceed further on the Jain Commission’s recommendation to interrogate Mr Karunanidhi, saying this was done under pressure from Ms Jayalalitha to save the BJP-led coalition government.

The party’s General Council, said the original ATR of the Centre had not mentioned Mr Karunanidhi’s name and alleged it was included later at the instigation of some central ministers from Tamil Nadu and under pressure from Ms Jayalalitha.

A former Union Minister and party MP, Mr T.R. Balu, said at the meeting that the Centre’s decision would only help Rajiv Gandhi’s assassins, who had filed an appeal in the Supreme Court against the special court verdict.

Reacting to the developments, the Janata Party president, Dr Subramanian Swamy, termed the Jain Commission report as ""malafide and biased"" and the Action Taken Report (ATR) ""a device by the RSS to use governmental agencies to try and subdue me"".

""The Jain final report has been manipulated and in the end it carries no recommendations, but the ATR has deliberately dragged me to undermine my standing in Indian politics,"" he told a press conference here.

Asking the research community not to be provoked by the US action, the spokesman said the government was not contemplating any plan to retaliate despite a call to do so recently by some Members of Parliament.

""We do not want to take this battle to street corner. We want to behave in a dignified and mature way,"" he said.The way Indian scientists are being treated as ""bonded labour"" is an insult to the US scientific community and its academic freedom, he said, hoping that American scientists themselves would take up this issue with the Clinton administration.

The spokesman, however, said his ministry was not sitting idle and was scrutinising various options to hit back at the USA, if necessary. For instance, India can stop providing the Insat satellite data badly needed by the US scientists, he said, adding that American companies also stood to lose if New Delhi backed out of an agreement signed early this year to test US-made male contraceptives and withdrew from scores of other projects on vaccines and drugs of interest to Washington.

But some scientists complained that Indian bureaucrats and science administrators were not really serious on retaliation against the USA because of vested interests. ""Almost all of them have sons, daughters, or relatives studying in a US university on a scholarship or a fellowship,"" said a scientist on conditions of anonymity.

Observers said the 40 years of Indo-US cooperation in science and technology, which saw many ups and downs, had now reached the lowest point.","he Ministry of Science and Technology declared no intention to retaliate against the US expulsion of seven Indian scientists and the crackdown on affiliations with American atomic and defence entities.

The accused were absconding and police parties had launched a hunt to nab them, according to Mr A.S. Chahal, SP (H).

This is the third such incident in the region in the last four days. Sukhwinder Kaur of village Khak Kalyan in Faridkot district ended her life three days ago after repeated harassment by her father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law and sister-in-law for bringing insufficient dowry. She hanged herself from the ceiling with her ""chunni"".

On July 27 Amarjit Kaur was allegedly poisoned to death in Joga village, (Mansa) by her in-laws when their demand for more dowry was not met by the parents of the deceased.

Jaswinder Kaur, who died yesterday, had been married for only two months. She belonged to Sanghera village in Sangrur district.

According to the statement of her father, the deceased was harassed by her husband and mother-in-law to get her to bring an additional Rs 50,000 from her parents as dowry. He alleged that when their demands were not met, she was ""forced to kill herself"".

Police sources said Jaswinder Kaur died yesterday morning and her parents came to know of it at noon. Her relatives informed the police.

Dr Vineeta Gupta, Member, National Council, People's Union of Civil Liberties (PUCL), while talking to TNS alleged that no ice slabs were placed under the dead body until 2 am although the body was received at around 7 pm by the civil hospital authorities.

She alleged that the doctor on duty asked relatives of the deceased to bring the necessary items for conducting a post mortem of dead body although this was illegal.

Dr Jugraj Singh, SMO, when contacted said that a doctor who had not conducted the post mortem by absenting himself would be dealt with as per department rules and regulation. He had also sought an explanation from the doctor.

Civil hospital sources said a two- member panel of doctors had been constituted for conducting a post mortem on the body, which started at about 12.30 pm today.

Police sources said, there were injury marks on the body and the deceased appeared to have been severely beaten on the day of her death.

Meanwhile, relatives of the deceased have also demanded an action against the doctor who deliberately delayed the post mortem by absenting himself from duty.","Police registered a case against a husband and mother-in-law under Sections 304-B and 498-A in the death of Jaswinder Kaur, the third dowry-related death in the region in four days.

Mr Naidu told reporters there was no need for the DMK to overreact on the ATR and also on the government’s decision to refer such issues when the commission wanted further probe by multi-disciplinary monitoring agency.

""Observations by the Jain Commission with regard to DMK leader and Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu M. Karunanidhi is serious and it deserves to be looked into"", he said, adding that the commission in page 361, volume five, had said Mr Karunanidhi was not interrogated on certain issues, which were relevant.

The general secretary said since the government had not come to any conclusion, ""Then why should the DMK overreact and make charges against the government. Truth should be made known to the public"".

Mr Naidu said, ""The government will not work under pressure from any quarters. It is interested to bring out the realities before the people. Besides, 26 conspirators involved in the assassination, some more persons might be involved"".

Mr Naidu said: ""In 1994 senior Congress leader Arjun Singh had objected when the Congress party, which was in power at that time wanted to wind it up demanding further probe raising many issues"".

""The BJP has not appointed the Jain Commission nor has it made any changes. There is uneasiness among Congress leaders as Chandraswami was very close to certain leaders"", Mr Naidu said.

The general secretary said the BJP wanted further discussion on the report and on the Verma Commission report as there were some serious observations made in it.","BJP's Venkaiah Naidu defended the government's decision to order a multi-disciplinary probe following the Jain Commission's findings on Rajiv Gandhi's assassination.

The party did not agree with the action taken report (ATR) as such as parts were ""politically motivated,"" senior Congress leader Arjun Singh told reporters.

""There is no contradiction between the interim report and the final report. Have a look at the report"", he said in reply to questions on the final report, virtually saying nothing on the role of the DMK and its Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi on whom the interim report had come down heavily.

To another question, he said the party did not regret its decision to pull down the United Front government on the issue of dropping the DMK ministers in the wake of interim report late last year.

In reply to a query whether the party repented the line taken last year on the interim report, he replied in the negative saying that ""there is no change in the Congress perception"".

He said the party’s stand in details would be elaborated in Parliament when the discussion on the report takes place.

The government has decided to set up the MDMA in the CBI to further investigate the role of controversial 'godman' Chandraswamy, Janata Party MP Subramanian Swamy and all other accused in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, and on how to proceed on the commission’s recommendations to interrogate Mr Karunanidhi.

Sidestepping questions whether the Congress, like the AIADMK, would demand dismissal of the DMK government, he said there was ""a slight delicacy"" involved in putting forth the party’s point of view.

Asked whether the Congress would approach the DMK for its support to party candidate P.M. Sayeed for the Lok Sabha Deputy Speakership, he said ""if somebody wants to support our candidate, he is welcome.""

Asked whether the Congress repented its earlier decision to withdraw support to the United Front government based on the interim report of the Jain Commission, he said there were no regrets.

We had only asked the Gujral government to drop the three DMK ministers till the DMK was cleared of the charges. When Mr Gujral was not ready even to talk to us, we had decided to withdraw support to his government, the Congress leader remarked.

The CWC regretted the BJP's failure to honour the convention to have the Deputy Speaker from the largest opposition party and said the ruling party went back on its initial commitment.

The CWC accepted the recommendations of the Karunakaran committee on constitutional affairs to extend the term of all committees and office-bearers of the Congress party from two to three years.

The party deplored the steps being taken to dilute the rights provided to the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe employees by the Congress governments. The committee requested the party chief to set up a small committee to go into the details of the matter and submit a report to her at the earliest.

Ms Gandhi, in her opening remarks, thanked the Congress workers for their massive presence in the Capital on July 28 to participate in the agitational programme. She said these agitational programmes of the party would continue.","The Congress Working Committee accepted the Jain Commission's final report but rejected the multi-disciplinary monitoring agency (MDMA) formation. It maintained a tough stance against the DMK, avoiding commentary on the report's specifics. No regrets were expressed for withdrawing support to the United Front government.

The Tribune,1998-08-03 00:00:00,Defer Deputy Speaker's poll,"In a deft move, the Trinamool Congress today urged the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress to withdraw their respective candidates for the post of Deputy Speaker and pressed for postponement of the August 4 election with a view to evolving a consensus on the issue.

Addressing newspersons, the Trinamool leader, Ms Mamata Banerjee, said she has conveyed her views on the Deputy Speaker’s issue both to the Prime Minister, Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee, and the Congress leaders, Mr P.A. Sangma and Mr Santosh Mohan Deb. The Lok Sabha should not be divided on the issue, she said. ""I have told both the parties to work for a consensus"", she said.

According to the schedule of the Deputy Speaker’s election, the nominations have to be filed tomorrow. The election, if needed, has to take place on August 4.

While the Congress has nominated the veteran parliamentarian, Mr P.M. Sayeed,who has also been promised support by the Left parties, and the Janata Dal and other Opposition parties, the ruling BJP combine has fielded three time Lok Sabha MP from Dhanbad in Bihar, Mrs Rita Verma for the post.

""If the Congress withdraws its candidate, then I will convince the Prime Minister. He is sensible. He is not rigid"", Ms Banerjee said.

Claiming that her party has the support of five North-east MPs on the issue, the Trinamool leader said: ""We do not want the government to be toppled or the House divided at this juncture.""

Ms Banerjee said ""we (MPs from North-east) held a meeting on Friday and will be meeting again shortly to take a collective decision on Deputy Speaker"".

The change in her stand, comes a day before the ruling coalition MPs are to meet under the chairmanship of Mr Vajpayee to finalise their stand on the issue.

To a question whether she would support any candidate nominated by the Prime Minister, Ms Banerjee said ""we will decide that at our meeting tomorrow... We will attend tomorrow’s BJP and its allies meeting convened by Mr Vajpayee and press for consensus"".

""Our options are open till tomorrow and not the day after"", she said adding that the Congress and the BJP ""should not be rigid"".

However, she maintained that there was no danger to the government. ""We do not want this government to fall. Our commitment is to this government and there is no question of withdrawing support. There is no connection between the Deputy Speaker’s election and the (stability of) the government"", Ms Banerjee asserted.

To a question whether the Trinamool Congress would join the government, she said ""we have not taken a decision on the issue as yet"".

However, sources close to Ms Banerjee said there was a direct co-relationship between her demand for postponement of Deputy Speaker’s election and her party joining the government. She has successfully managed to rope in five MPs from the North-east for striking a bargain, sources said adding that she was now claiming support of 12 MPs.

Ms Banerjee has been trying to bargain for posts of two cabinet minister and one minister of state for her party. At the same time, she would like to give an impression that her party was not opposed to the candidature of the Congress nominee, Mr P.M. Sayeed.

It was a bargain, rather a very tough bargain in the disguise of nice principles, a senior Samata Party leader said. Everything would be settled tomorrow, he said.

On the deportation of the illegal Bangladeshi migrants from Mumbai, Ms Banerjee said atrocities have been committed against them. ""There may be Bangladeshis there. But they should not be ill treated"", she said adding that there were some Indians too who were harassed.

She said the Maharashtra government has promised to stop deportation for three months. The government would thus get time to finalise its strategy on the deportation issue,she pointed out.","Trinamool Congress urged BJP and Congress to withdraw Deputy Speaker candidates for consensus, proposing election postponement. Leader Mamata Banerjee reached out to PM Vajpayee and Congress leaders Sangma and Deb. Five North-east MPs backed Trinamool's stance. Banerjee aimed to prevent a divided House, ensuring government stability. Trinamool kept doors open for joining government, aiming for key ministerial posts. The move intertwined the Deputy Speaker election delay with Trinamool's government inclusion, leveraging support from North-east MPs. Banerjee's stance favored Congress' nominee while making a strong yet subtle bargaining move. She also addressed the deportation issue in Mumbai, seeking humane treatment for Bangladeshi migrants.",Politics,102,643

The Tribune,1998-08-03 00:00:00,	BJP distorting facts: TN CM," In a stepped up offensive, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi today accused the BJP government at the Centre of committing a ""mischievous fraud"" in the action taken report on the Jain Commission findings saying it had been done by completely ""distorting and manipulating the facts with an ulterior political motive to malign me and DMK.""

A day after his party DMK alleged that reference to him in the ATR was done under the pressure of AIADMK supremo J. Jayalalitha, Mr Karunanidhi in a hard hitting statement to the press sought to contest the inferences drawn by the ATR on the Jain Commission’s recommendations in the final report.

The statement said the inclusion of Mr Karunanidhi’s name in the ""role of suspects in the assassination"" was a ""fraudulent manipulation and wanton mischief unworthy of the powers that be.""

""In sum, I only pity the ‘tall’ BJP leaders, who once claimed to have stood for some principles and had to stoop to this level because of the bad company they keep,"" he said.

The Chief Minister said in the final report, which runs into more than 2,000 pages covering various personalities and theories, direct reference to his name found mention in only one page and that too in one line under the under topic where it was ""innocuously"" mentioned that SIT did not interrogate Chandraswamy, Seshan, Subramaniam Swamy, J. Jayalalitha and P.V. Narasimha Rao.

""In continuation of that it is added: M. Karunanidhi was also not interrogated. On many matters, his interrogation was quite relevant.""

Mr Karunanidhi said ""This innocuous sentence was unfairly and improperly taken out of context and used by the ATR to suit their own purposes which is reprehensible.""

He contended that as this sentence alone was ""scooped out of the entire paragraph mischievously,"" he was duty-bound to clarify he was examined and cross-examined by the Jain Commission on oath and in public for more than five days and unlike some of them he was forthright 'without withholding' anything.

""This reference that on ‘many matters his interrogation was quite relevant’ relates to my deposition and nothing more,"" he said.

Detailing his theory of ""fraud"", the Chief Minister said while the reference to him in the Jain Commission Report was made in the chapter on ‘Stand of the SIT on the theories beyond LTTE"", his name was ""cunningly"" included by the ATR under the heading ""role of suspects in the assassination"".

""This is nothing but a fraudulent manipulation and wanton mischief unworthy of the powers that be,"" he said.

Mr Karunanidhi said in the entire final report there was no ""doubt, suspicion or apprehension"" at all about him or his conduct whereas the ATR has used the plural ""misgivings"" against him ""which was nothing but a tissue of lies and distortion of facts"".","Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi strongly condemned the BJP-led Centre, accusing it of manipulating the Jain Commission's action taken report (ATR). He claimed the ATR distorted facts to malign him and the DMK, pointing out the misrepresentation of his role in the report. Karunanidhi emphasized his comprehensive and honest deposition before the Commission, refuting ATR's implications. He criticized the report's inclusion of his name among assassination suspects, terming it ""fraudulent manipulation"" and a deliberate distortion of facts. Karunanidhi maintained that the ATR's claims about him were baseless and expressed disappointment over the misrepresentation.",Local News,94,464

The tribune,1998-08-05 00:00:00,Butler’s talks with Iraq collapse,"A fresh UN-Iraq standoff loomed today as Chief UN Weapons Inspector Richard Butler cut short his visit to Baghdad following collapse of the talks on further investigations into Iraq’s alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction.

“My duty is to report what has happened to the security council and the United Nations,” television networks quoted Mr Butler as saying. “I’m going to New York to do that.”

Earlier after meeting Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, Mr Butler had said he did not know whether the talks would continue and that they could be suspended.

Mr Aziz on the other hand, said he did not see any point in deciding on a programme of action if UNSCOM was still up to its “old tricks”. Observers have no doubt that Mr Butler would report that Iraq had refused to cooperate with the UN weapons inspectors’ investigations, which may bring about yet another stand-off with the USA.

Reuters adds from Manama: Mr Butler said Iraq had rejected his proposal to extend his work on missile and chemical weapons for another month and instead demanded he close his files immediately.

Mr Butler, who cut short his Baghdad visit, said on arrival in Bahrain that the request was submitted to him by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz during talks in the Iraqi capital.
","UN Weapons Inspector Richard Butler shortened his Baghdad trip as talks collapsed over probing Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction. Butler stated his intent to report the situation to the UN. Despite earlier uncertainty, Iraq rejected extending investigations, demanding immediate closure. Observers expect Butler's report of Iraqi non-cooperation, possibly escalating tension with the USA. Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz opposed any action while accusing UNSCOM of deceit. Butler's visit's abrupt end marks a fresh UN-Iraq confrontation, highlighting Baghdad's refusal to extend inspections, intensifying international scrutiny over alleged weapons possession.",International News,89,219

Ivanisevic outlasts Lareau

TORONTO, Aug 4 (Reuters) — Tenth-seeded Croatian Goran Ivanisevic disappointed record crowds on the first day of the Canadian Open by defeating Canadian Sebastien Lareau 7-6 (14-12) 7-6 (7-4).

A civic holiday in Toronto and a promotion that allowed families to enter for free resulted in a total of 20,346 fans crowding the site yesterday.

Malivai Washington of the USA posted the only upset of the day when he beat 13th-seeded Jan Siemerink of the Netherlands 7-6 (7-2) 6-3.

In a match between the Black brothers from Zimbabwe, Wayne, 24 and ranked 105th, defeated Byron, 28, and ranked 32nd, 6-4 6-0.

In other first-round matches, Australian Scott Draper outlasted American Jim Courier 7-5 5-7 6-4 and 14th-seeded Aussie Mark Philippoussis won 6-4 6-3 over American Doug Flach.

The Ivanisevic-Lareau contest saw several momentum swings. The 16th-ranked Croatian served three double faults in a row to go down 3-4 in the opening set. But then Ivanisevic broke the 95th-ranked Canadian on four points on his way to a eight-point run.

Ivanisevic won the first-set tiebreak on his sixth set point with a blistering serve return winner.

Lareau led 5-2 in the second set but Ivanisevic rallied and finished the tiebreak and the match with his 20th ace.

Ivanisevic, who lost in the first round last week in Los Angeles, is still haunted by losing to world number one Pete Sampras in the Wimbledon final last month.

""Even half the time today, I was thinking about Wimbledon and I’m still having trouble finding my motivation,"" Ivanisevic said. ""I’m thinking if I could have made those two service returns (on set points in the second-set tiebreak), I could have won Wimbledon.""

""We both played to a high standard,"" said Draper, who was able to get the better of Courier with aggressive groundstrokes.

Several hours after the match, a pensive, despondent Courier sat immobile by himself on the steps of a tournament van for about 45 minutes.

Washington, a finalist at Wimbledon in 1996, has been hampered by a knee problem that required surgery in April, 1997. His win over Siemerink was his first since April.

""I’ve been playing a limited schedule this year,"" said the 217th-ranked Washington. ""I missed the French Open and Wimbledon and I’ve kind of said to myself that how I do this summer will be a telltale sign for the rest of the year and next year.""","On the opening day of the Canadian Open, Goran Ivanisevic defeated Sebastien Lareau in two tiebreak sets, while Malivai Washington upset Jan Siemerink. Wayne Black beat his brother Byron. Other matches saw Scott Draper defeat Jim Courier, and Mark Philippoussis win against Doug Flach. Ivanisevic expressed lingering disappointment from losing in the Wimbledon final.",Sports,54,401
The Tribune,1998-08-05 00:00:00,Hundreds die in blow-up of China’s dykes,"Hundreds of soldiers and residents were killed as the Chinese authorities ordered dykes along the Yangtze river to be blown up to prevent major cities being engulfed by rising floods, a rights group said here today.

At least 150 soldiers from the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) from an air force unit based in the central Chinese city of Wuhan lost their lives along with several hundred residents who were fighting flood waters, the Information Centre of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.

The incident happened on Saturday in Jiayu county, 70 km north in the upper reaches of Yangtze river in Wuhan, spokesman Frank Lu said.

Lu said hundreds of residents were drowned in the sudden deluge of flood waters in the countryside.

As of yesterday, at least nine bodies of PLA soldiers were recovered, but the Chinese authorities have imposed a news blackout over the event.

The water level in the Yangtze in Wuhan has dropped by some 10 millimetres.

China only admitted yesterday that it had begun blowing up dykes along the Yangtze to flood the countryside in a bid to prevent major cities being engulfed by the river.

The strategy was aimed at protecting Wuhan - a major industrial city with a population of seven million that has been threatened for weeks by the record high waters on China’s longest river, the report said.","Hundreds, including PLA soldiers and residents, died as Chinese authorities detonated Yangtze River dykes to curb city flooding. Around 150 soldiers from Wuhan’s air force unit perished. The incident occurred in Jiayu county, causing an abrupt deluge, resulting in resident fatalities.

The Tribune,1998-08-05 00:00:00,  	 Emergency declared in Lanka,"Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga today declared a state of emergency throughout the country, a move seen by political observers as the first step to postpone crucial provincial elections.

In a special gazette notification issued here, Mrs Chandrika said the tough laws, under which suspects could be arrested and detained, were being invoked “in the interest of public security, protection of public order and the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the life of the community.”

The state of emergency was being clamped because she felt there was a “public emergency” in the country, Mrs Chandrika said. The notification, however, made no reference to postponing the council elections.

But speculations about the government taking a recourse to tough laws to put off the poll were rife after the opposition UNP expressed reluctance to support an official move to postpone the polls through an amendment in Parliament. The UNP instead demanded holding of presidential elections, two years ahead of the due date.

Political observers said the move to invoke extraordinary laws was aimed at postponing provincial council elections as the main Opposition had refused to amend laws to delay the vote which was due on August 28.

The main Opposition UNP sources alleged the government move to declare emergency was a clear indication that it was backing down from holding key elections, fearing defeat.

The government had earlier said the postponement of council elections was necessary in view of preoccupation of the security forces fighting LTTE rebels and difficulty in mobilising enough security for poll.

The Inspector-General of Police, the highest police official of the country, Mr W.B.S. Rajaguru, had written to the Election Commission expressing his inability to provide adequate number of police personnel for elections.

Two prominent Buddhist monks, representing popular Buddhist sects, also called for the postponement of elections till the war against the rebels was won.

The Sri Lankan constitution, however, does not allow the government to delay the vote for the provincial councils, the highest level of local government, unless a state of emergency is declared across the country.

Also all the major political parties, including the ruling People’s Alliance, have already fielded their candidates for the crucial poll.

Today’s proclamation of emergency would enable the government to indefinitely postpone the poll.","Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga declared a nationwide state of emergency, citing public security and essential services. Observers noted this move as a potential step to delay crucial provincial elections. While the declaration didn't explicitly mention postponing the council elections, speculation arose due to the opposition's reluctance to support an official amendment for delay. The opposition UNP suspected the government's emergency proclamation was an attempt to avoid potential defeat. The government cited security force preoccupation with LTTE rebels and difficulties in ensuring election security. The emergency declaration, while allowing indefinite postponement, contravenes constitutional mandates for provincial council elections, already underway with candidate nominations.",International News,103,377
THE TRIBUNE,1998-08-05 00:00:00,Srinath available for selection,"
BANGALORE Aug 4 (PTI) — Pace spearhead Javagal Srinath has fully recovered from the side strain he suffered in late March and has declared himself available for national selection.

""I am 100 per cent fit and I have been bowling all out. I need some more practice to touch my peak again,"" the lanky bowler, who turned out for Indian Airlines in the Buchi Babu Tournament in Chennai last week, told PTI here.

The Karnataka paceman said he was available for the camp starting in Chennai on August 21 and that he would bowl all out if picked by selectors, who meet in Mumbai on August 9.

Bowling in the Buchi Babu Tournament, where his team failed to make the quarterfinals, had done him a lot of good as he aims to touch his fiery best in time for tournaments in September and the Dhaka ICC Mini World Cup in late October.

Srinath, who gained appreciable pace and movement on return to action opening the attack for MCC XI against World XI in the July 18 Diana memorial tie at the Lord’s was happy with his effort.

""It was more psychological for me and it is good I went into the game without any pain. On the whole I don’t think I bowled badly. I bowled perhaps 60 to 70 per cent and all I need is more match practice,"" he said.

Srinath, who was forced out for eight months last year due to a rotator cuff tear in his bowling arm, said the rib strain was commonplace among fast bowlers. ""Since I am coming back from the second injury, I want to be physically stronger. That’s what I am working at.""

Asked about his treatment and whether he was still in touch with the doctors, Srinath said strengthening the side muscles was very important for him. ""My shoulder strengthening has to keep on going. At the same time I have to look after my sides,"" he said.

The 28-year-old paceman said he realised it would take some time for him to fully recover from the side strain after he spoke to cricketers who had suffered similar injury.

Chris Carins (New Zealand medium-pacer) had the same injury and he took the same amount of time to return to the game.

Pakistan's Wasim Akram had this problem and he took six months to get back into the game. Once I came to know all this I knew my injury will take four to six months to heal.

Asked if he was preparing for next year's World Cup, he said it was a long way off. ""There are many other games coming up before it. I will take one game at a time,"" he said.

Srinath was grateful to all those who had stood by him and encouraged to recover fast. ""Such encouragement will motive anybody to come back at the top level,"" he said.","Javagal Srinath, fully recovered from a side strain, declared himself fit for national selection. He participated in the Buchi Babu Tournament and aims to peak for upcoming tournaments. Srinath, previously sidelined by a rotator cuff tear, emphasizes strengthening side muscles. He remains focused on gradual recovery and appreciates the support received.",Sports,51,483
The Tribune,1998-08-05 00:00:00,Sonia alerts party MPs,"NEW DELHI, Aug 4 — The Congress President, Mrs Sonia Gandhi, today suggested that the BJP-led coalition government could come apart any time due to internal quarrels and asked the party MPs to ""be on the alert for any development... At any time we might be called upon to assume responsibilities"".

The politically significant statement came during her address at the customary end-of-the-session general body of the Congress Party in Parliament of which she is the Chairperson.

Describing the current Parliament session as the ""most unproductive monsoon session"" she said the government had revealed through this session, its inexperience, lack of direction, incoherence and internal distensions.

""There has been no governance, only a struggle for survival"", she said.

The Congress President said the instability of the government had not arisen from anything her party was doing but the ruling coalition's ""own internal quarrels"".

She said it was clear that the so-called national agenda for governance had brought about serious differences between the coalition partners. She said there had been no reconciliation of the policy.

""In these circumstances, the Congress has to be on the alert for any development in the medium or even short term. At any moment we might be called upon to assume responsibilities"", she said.

The Congress President asked the MPs to use the inter-session period to strengthen the party at the grassroots and advised them to interact with ordinary Congress workers.

On the Jain Commission reports, she said the truth about the assassinations must come out, what had been uncovered must be highlighted and what remained to be investigated should be probed.

Describing the issue as one which affected Congress workers deeply and emotionally, she said the MPs should educate the workers and people on what was contained in the Jain reports.

Referring to the recent Goa episode, she said, ""not only have we faced betrayal by those elected on our ticket, the Governor appointed by the government has shown bias and favouritism"".

She said politicisation of high constitutional office ""bodes ill for the future’’ and directed the MPs to be vigilant to forestall and expose the twisting of constitution by the government to serve its narrow ends.

Turning to the Assembly elections due in Madhya Pradesh, Mizoram, Delhi and Rajasthan, she asked them to work to replace the existing non-Congress governments in Delhi and Rajasthan while ensuring return in other two states.

""I sense resurgence for the Congress in the air. But atmospherics alone will not do. Hard work is required. These state Assembly elections are going to be a major pre-occupation of ours during the inter-sessional period"", she said.

She also touched upon the international issues and said between now and November, the country could witness disturbing developments on the international stage.

India, she said, could find itself in the dock at the UN General Assembly due to diplomatic errors of the government.

The Congress offered cooperation to the government in ensuring that ""India’s name is not tarnished and national interests are protected"", she said adding that regrettably, ""there is little indication that the government is taking the initiative to re-establish national consensus on the foreign and defence policy"".

She said national consensus would also be needed to face the UN General Assembly and the key questions would be Kashmir and nuclear weapons.

The Congress President also had a word of praise for the party MPs for maintaining decorum and reason even when the House was ""plunged in chaos. It is such good behaviour that persuades the country that the Congress is the natural party of governance, the party with which democracy is safe"".","Congress President Sonia Gandhi suggested that the BJP-led coalition government in India could collapse due to internal conflicts, emphasizing the ""most unproductive monsoon session."" She cited the government's inexperience, lack of direction, and internal disputes, claiming the instability arose from the coalition's internal quarrels. Sonia urged Congress MPs to be alert, indicating a potential assumption of responsibilities. She addressed issues like the Jain Commission reports, Goa episode betrayal, and upcoming state elections. Sonia also expressed concern about possible international scrutiny at the UN General Assembly and called for national consensus on foreign and defense policy, offering cooperation to protect India's interests.",Politics,101,600
The Tribune,1998-08-05 00:00:00," USA asks India, Pak to resume talks","Concerned about artillery exchanges across the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir, the Clinton Administration has decided to despatch shortly formal messages to India and Pakistan, asking them to refrain from “provocative” actions and rhetoric with a view to preventing the escalation of tension in the volatile region.

It also made an appeal to the two countries to resume their “senior-level dialogue as soon as possible and to approach these talks imaginatively and constructively.”

“We are willing to assist the parties in this process at the request of both parties. We don’t offer to mediate unless requested by both sides,” said State Department spokesman James Rubin here yesterday while commenting on the recent developments along the LoC in Kashmir.

Asked whether the USA intended to send a special envoy to Delhi and Islamabad to deliver the messages to the two governments, he said” “I am talking about a diplomatic message from our government to the Indian and Pakistani governments, not a new trip or a new envoy or anything.”

Mr Rubin agreed with a questioner who characterised the situation “as an across-the-board deterioration” in the region.

He said clearly the meetings between Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee and his Pakistani counterpart in Colombo last week were not “fully successful.”

He, however, said “we have been in touch with both Indians and Pakistanis in a very intense discussion in recent weeks.”

In this context, he made it a point to refer to the meetings that US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and her Deputy Strobe Talbott had with Deputy Chairman of Planning Commission Jaswant Singh. “Albright had some opportunity to do that on her trip and obviously Deputy Secretary Talbott has gone through extensive discussions with the two sides,” Mr Rubin remarked.

“He’s going to continue to do that, and there are additional meetings planned in the coming weeks. So that is the diplomatic efforts that we’re doing and we believe there is enough reason for optimism to continue working on it,” he added.

Mr Rubin struck a cautious note, hastening to add “that doesn’t mean that we’re likely to see a breakthrough by any stretch of the imagination, but we’re working on the problem.”

With respect to the fighting along the Line of Control, he pointed out, the information that he had received was that “it tends to go up and down at this time of year. This was a particularly intense outburst of fighting with a particularly tragic loss of life, but it has calmed down today (Monday) and Yesterday (Sunday).”

“From Thursday to Saturday, artillery and small arms exchanges across the Line of Control, separating Kashmir, intensified, reportedly killing several people — many of them civilians”, the spokesman added.

LONDON: The British Government has called on Pakistan and India to resolve their differences through negotiations amid reports the two sides clashed for the sixth day on the Kashmir border.

Foreign Office Minister Derek Fatchett said reports of shooting across the Line of Control “can only add to the already high levels of tension.”

Mr Fatchett, who has just returned from a tour of southeast Asia, added: “It is essential that India and Pakistan resolve their differences through a dialogue”.

“Both countries have agreed a number of confidence-building measures in the past to prevent incidents along the Line of Control. These should now be fully implemented,” he said.

Mr Fatchett also referred to the recent nuclear tests by India and Pakistan, saying the two countries “need to take positive steps on nuclear non-proliferation and regional security.","The Clinton Administration plans to send formal messages urging India and Pakistan to avoid escalating tension along the Line of Control in Kashmir. State Department spokesman James Rubin emphasized the need for restraint, urging both nations to resume high-level talks. Despite recent discussions between leaders, including those involving US officials, Rubin noted ongoing efforts but cautioned against expecting an immediate breakthrough. Meanwhile, British Foreign Office Minister Derek Fatchett urged dialogue and implementation of confidence-building measures to address the heightened tension, emphasizing the importance of resolving differences through peaceful negotiations.",International News,89,586
THE TRIBUNE,1998-08-05 00:00:00,What role will Bobby Simpson play?,"CHANDIGARH, Aug 4 — What exactly will be the role of former Australian skipper and coach Bobby Simpson, who has been appointed consultant by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). Bobby Simpson, who signed a contract with the BCCI in February last, has been assigned the job by the board till the 1999 World Cup, scheduled to be held in England .

The national selectors of the board are scheduled to meet in Mumbai on August 9 to pick up 20 players, who will form the nucleus of the Indian team for the next World Cup. These selected players are scheduled to attend a coaching camp from August 21 to September 4 at Chennai under the supervision of Bobby Simpson.

The first question one would like to ask is: what are Bobby Simpson's credentials as a one-day specialist ? Going through the record books one learns that Bobby Simpson, who made his international debut in 1957, has in a career spanning over 20 years , played only two one-day internationals, both against the West Indies in 1978, the year he retired from competitive international cricket. Therefore, the one-day experience of the ""consultant"" comes into sharp focus because the national team is now preparing for next year's World Cup.

The contract between the board and Bobby Simpson was finalised after the former Australian skipper had come to India as match referee for the series against Sri Lanka late last year. At that time Indian cricket was going through a very bad phase with the team performing below par, both in the longer version as well as in one-dayers. At that time the senior functionaries of the board approached Simpson with the proposal that he should agree to become consultant for the Indian team. Simpson, who has also coached the Australian team for some time agreed but on the condition that he would join only after the tour of India by the Australian team scheduled in March-April last. The board agreed to this condition also.

As said earlier Indian cricket was going through a bad phase when the contract with Simpson was signed. But subsequently, the fortunes of Indian cricket took an upswing with the team winning the Independence Cup in Bangladesh, the Sharjah Cup, the four-nation tournament in India and the Independence Cup in Sri Lanka. The only tournament which the Indian team lost during this period was the three-nation series involving Australia, Zimbabwe and India at home. But India immediately overcame this loss with a fine win at Sharjah . In this tournament too Australia were the main opposition.

The Indian cricket already has a cricket coach, a physiotherapist and a team doctor. Also, when the team travels abroad it has an administrative manager also. Therefore, what will Simpson do? As has been stated by certain board functionaries the Australian will have no role in team selection and will only draw up strategies. But is one to believe that there is nobody else among all the Indian players with international experience who can do this job?

There are many former players who probably have more cricketing acumen that the former Australian allrounder. The names which quickly come to mind include those of Kapil Dev (and who can forget the way he led India to victory in the 1983 World Cup held in England), Sunil Gavaskar or even somebody like Mohinder Amarnath (he also has done some good coaching of the Bangladesh team).

One might argue that neither Kapil or Gavaskar will be willing to forego their business and other commitments to take over as consultant of the Indian team but if the money is right then they can be coaxed to do national duty. As it is Simpson will be given £ 2000 per week when he is in India . Besides this payment the board is already spending $ 2000 on physio Andrew James Kukinos, who has also come from Australia. The physio is also paid allowances admissible to the members of the Indian team.

One might know that Simpson is suffering from an acute knee problem. Therefore, he is not in a position to join the players on the ground and cannot involve himself in active participation at nets. He will, therefore, sit on the sidelines and draw up strategies. Of what use is this? And also it is not known whether he will accompany the team on tour because strategies can only be worked out after seeing the wicket condition, weather and the relative strength of the opposition","Bobby Simpson, appointed consultant by the BCCI until the 1999 World Cup, faces scrutiny due to his limited one-day cricket experience. His role, focused on strategy, raises questions amidst India's successful streak. Critics suggest other Indian cricket veterans for the role. Simpson's knee ailment limits his active involvement in training.",Sports,50,754

According to police sources, a manhunt has been launched to track down the absconding builder-owner Jayaram Chawla.

The Tribune,1998-08-05 00:00:00,Should child labour be banned?," Law prohibits child labour, human rights organisations decry the practice and the developed world shuns their products. Yet it’s a fact of life that can’t be wished away.

A ban on child labour will only push it underground like the world’s oldest profession, say trade unionists suggesting a more regulated and a better working environment instead.

Social activists are unwilling to buy it saying it would only make matters worse. Swami Agnivesh for one says: “A total ban on child labour is the only way to eliminate the problem from its roots.”

According to the Asia Labour Monitor report, at least 55 million children in India earn about 150 million a day which amounts to less than Rs 3 per child but contribute to more than one fifth of the total GNP of the country.

But as the children do not get even one-fifth of what they produce, they continue in poverty even as the family elders lose their bargaining power with employers who prefer cheap labour.

“We have come to a stage where we have to admit that withdrawing children from units is not the answer as it only heaps more misery on the child’s family,” says Mr P.K. Ganguly, national secretary of the Centre for Trade Unions (CITU).

“But we have to ensure that children are not made to work for more than six hours a day and are given a respectable wage along with free compulsory education,” he says.

“Offering better working conditions and a higher wage would only soften a burning issue and give the government more time to brood over the matter which will go against the cause”, says Swami Agnivesh demanding that the entire industry, including the victims, put pressure on the government to eliminate the problem.

Although unions are alert to the fact that fresh recruitments have to be nipped in the bud, they cite many loopholes in the existing legal system which makes immediate elimination a difficult task.

They say, as the Factory Act does not permit the employment of children, employers have entered into contracts and sub-contracts with middlemen who perpetuate the growth of child labour and at the same time satiate the needs of the industry.

The problem worsens in the unorganised sector where self-employed and home-based industries like bidi, handloom, agarbatti and brick-kiln escape from the clutches of the law.

Trade unions say that the existing laws are thus useless as employers will always devise ways and means to get cheap labour. The answer, therefore, lies in changing the employer’s attitude and urging them to provide decent working conditions.

But social activist Kailash Satyarthi working at the South Asian coalition on Child Servitude (SAACS) says “though it is difficult to eliminate child labour, it is not a utopian idea.”

“It is a misconception to link child labour with poverty. During the time of Independence, there were one crore child labourers and a corresponding one crore unemployed adults. Today, we have six crore child labourers and an equal number of unemployed adult population which means there is a parallel relation between the two.”

“And if we provide them with jobs, living conditions would improve too,” says Mr Satyarthi.

Employment of children has also led to the growth of black money as big industries like diamond cutting and polishing and handlooms save billions of rupees by showing accounts in which payments to adult workers are shown in lieu of the paltry salaries offered to children.

According to a CITU survey covering nine unorganised sectors like matchmaking, bidi rolling, bangle industry and small restaurants in 14 states, the children are paid a measly sum in lieu of long working hours and that sum is also handed over only to their parents.

Certain children are also forced to work without wages like 11-year-old Sahukat Ali who was rescued from a spices pounding unit and who is at present placed in a rehabilitation home.

“Initially, I worked in a biscuit factory where I slogged from 4 am to 1 am but due to ill treatment, I escaped from the unit. Subsequently, I worked in a spices pounding unit under suffocating conditions”, says Shaukat.

“But since the employer did not pay me wages for five months, I escaped from their clutches”, he says.","The reality of child labor persists despite legal bans, human rights outcry, and product boycotts. While some advocate regulated work environments, activists like Swami Agnivesh demand a total ban to uproot the issue. Children contribute significantly to India's economy but receive only a fraction of what they generate, trapping families in poverty. Suggestions for controlled work hours and fair wages surface, but Swami Agnivesh insists on immediate eradication. The nexus of industries, middlemen, and loopholes in legislation perpetuates child labor, especially in unorganized sectors. Addressing employer attitudes and offering better conditions are proposed solutions, while activist Kailash Satyarthi advocates job creation for both children and adults to alleviate the problem.",National News,110,708
The Tribune,1998-08-05 00:00:00,"Tell success stories, Atal tells party MPs","The Prime Minister, Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee, today asked the Bharatiya Janata Party MPs to explain to the people the achievements of the coalition government.

Addressing the last meeting of the BJP parliamentary party of the current session of Parliament, the Prime Minister said the winter session would be held in November.

Mr Vajpayee, who had to leave the meeting to attend to some other important business, asked the Union Home Minister, Mr L.K. Advani, to carry on with the proceedings, party sources said.

Continuing from where Mr Vajpayee had left, Mr Advani told the MPs that the Finance Minister, Mr Yashwant Sinha’s Budget was so pro-people that it took days for the Opposition to find faults with it. Mr Advani informed the members that the proposed Bills on Uttaranchal, Vananchal and Chhattisgarh, which were cleared by the Cabinet yesterday, have been forwarded to the President for his comments.

Speaking on the law and order situation in Jammu and Kashmir, Mr Advani said the situation has improved in the Kashmir valley during the past two months. The increasing number of tourists and film shootings there were firm indicators of it, he pointed out admitting that there were ""pricks"" in the situation like massacres in Chamba and Doda. The government would not compromise on its determination to flush out terrorists from these areas, Mr Advani said.

On the election of the Deputy Speaker, Mr Advani told the MPs that the Trinamool Congress leader, Ms Mamata Banerjee, has taken the responsibility for evolving a consensus on the issue. If there was no consensus, the BJP would contest the election since it was the single largest party with 181 MPs, he said.

On the Jain Commission Report and the Action Taken Report (ATR), Mr Advani said the government was determined to find out who was the brain behind the Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination. ""We are going about ruthlessly"", he said.

Making a strong defence of the government’s decision to set up a multi-disciplinary monitoring agency (MDMA), Mr Advani said the CBI was chosen as the agency to carry on the further investigations since it was the only statutory body. He said the BJP was not responsible for the fallout of the past rift between the Congress and the DMK on this issue.

THE TRIBUNE,1998-08-05 00:00:00,NATO nod for Kosovo military plan,"WASHINGTON, Aug 4 (AP) — NATO has approved plans to use firepower against the Serb forces in Kosovo, the Clinton Administration has said, adding its concern that the latest Serb offensive could generate a “humanitarian catastrophe” for tens of thousands of people forced to leave their homes.

The plans, focused on an aerial assault, are being fine-tuned by the NATO council, State Department officials said yesterday.

There was no immediate word on what would trigger an attack by NATO, US State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said that was up to President Bill Clinton and the other NATO political leaders. Nor was it clear whether this was mostly an attempt by the Administration to unnerve Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic by raising the threat again publicly.

The USA has raised the threat of bombing Serb forces in Kosovo several times since the current crisis erupted earlier this year. But Mr Milosevic has ignored the warnings, forcing the Administration to back down each time.

Mr Rubin did indicate an attack was not imminent, saying “further refinement is ongoing.”

And a NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity from the organisation’s headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, played down the possibility of military intervention, saying that at this stage NATO was simply putting the final touches on a number of possible actions in Kosovo and the region.

In Kosovo, a weekend of fighting displaced tens of thousands of people, some of them taking refuge in forests outside towns and now beyond the immediate reach of relief organisations. The UN relief agency estimated that 35,000 people fled their homes during the weekend. The Red Cross reported finding twice that number in one area alone.","NATO has approved plans for potential airstrikes against Serb forces in Kosovo, amid concerns of a humanitarian crisis due to recent Serb offensives. The USA emphasizes that any decision to attack would be made by President Clinton and NATO leaders. However, immediate military intervention is not imminent as plans are still being refined.",International News,53,278
THE TRIBUNE,1998-08-05 00:00:00,Pak team needs a motivator: Raja,"LAHORE, Aug 4 (ANI) — Former dashing Pakistan batsman, Wasim Raja has taken to his new job with Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) as national team coach.

He says the Pakistan team of brilliant players does not need a coach but a motivator.

""The Pakistan cricket team is very talented,"" he said yesterday. ""And at this level the players do not require a coach. What they need is a motivator who could collect them on a platform and help them perform their best,"" Surrey-based Raja said.

Raja said for this the PCB must bring in technical expert to correct the declining trends. ""There has to be someone who could encourage Pakistan players to fight till the full extent on a cricket field.""

The PCB is currently running an ICC-approved coaching course for Pakistan retired Test cricketers and first class playing players. Raja is heading the coaching drills.

Raja, brother of former Pakistan Test captain Rameez, revealed he was going to lay out the modes of coaching he learnt from the England and Wales Cricket Board approved centres.

He said Pakistan needed players who could transfer the knowledge they had gripped during their careers, but Raja emphasised on transferring the right things.

To a query, the once-bearded Raja said the right age to start training for a player is under-10 when he has the ability to understand the techniques of the sport. ""One should not finish the natural talents of a player through constant coaching,"" warned Raja.

He said Pakistan should hire three different coaches for their fielders, batsmen and bowlers of the national side to supplement a common practice followed in England.

The former all-rounder dispelled the notion that Pakistan could do well by separating their Test and one-day teams for future games.

Last year Australian and England separated their teams for cricket’s two versions but Raja said it was not necessary for Pakistan to copy others in an attempt to ease pressures on themselves.

Raja has conducted coaching courses since 1981 and is currently associated with Surrey Coaching Centre in Guilford besides working as a teacher of geography in Canterham.","Former Pakistan cricketer Wasim Raja has joined the PCB as the national team coach, emphasizing the need for motivation over coaching. He advocates technical expertise to uplift players' performance. Raja stresses starting training at a young age but warns against stifling natural talent. He suggests specialized coaches for different aspects of the game.",Sports,53,350
The Tribune,1998-08-05 00:00:00,Magsaysay award for Aquino," Former Philippines President Corazon Aquino has won this year’s Ramon Magsaysay Award for international understanding, the award body said today.

Ms Aquino (65), who helped depose the late President Ferdinand Marcos through a peaceful revolution in 1986, has been cited for “giving radiant force to the non-violent movement for democracy in the Philippines and in the world”.

Ms Aquino emerged from the shadow of her late husband, Sen Benigno Aquino Jr, after his assassination on August 21, 1983. Following Aquino’s death, his wife became the unifying symbol for the divided Opposition against the Marcos rule, which culminated in the four-day non-violent “people’s power” revolution in 1986 that drove Marcos out of the country.

Ms Aquino, who challenged Marcos in a snap presidential election in 1986, was eventually installed as President of the Philippines after Marcos fled into exile. She governed the country until June 30, 1992.","Corazon Aquino, former Philippines President, secured the Ramon Magsaysay Award for international understanding. Recognized for her role in the peaceful 1986 revolution against Ferdinand Marcos, she symbolized democracy's non-violent pursuit. Emerging after her husband's assassination, she unified opposition, leading to Marcos's exile and her presidency until 1992. The award honors Aquino's enduring influence on global democracy through her pivotal leadership in the Philippines.",Human Interest,63,146
The Tribune ,1998-08-05 00:00:00,20 of militant's family shot 9 killed in Udhampur villages,"Nine members of a community were killed in two incidents in Udhampur today.

Reports reaching here said a militant identified as Imtiyaz killed special police officer Zakir, a former militant. This enraged activists of a rival outfit. Imtiyaz is said to belong to Hizbul Mujahideen. Activists of Lashkar-e-Toiba swooped on Sailan village and opened indiscriminate fire on the family members of Imtiyaz. Three families, all relatives of Imtiyaz, were killed and six critically wounded.

Additional security forces have been rushed to the area and a manhunt has been launched against the killers. The village has been cordoned amid wailing by members of both communities over the massacre of 20 persons, including children and women.

Zakir, according to reports, was dragged out of a bus and shot dead by Imtiyaz wanted in connection with several killings in the Poonch-Rajouri area.

In a swift retaliatory action, supporters of Zakir, armed with automatic weapons, stormed the houses of Imtiyaz’s sons — Hassan Mohammad, Ahmad Din and Lassa Sheikh — and fired indiscriminately, killing 11 girls, three minor boys, two women and three men.

The incident has confirmed reports that militants belonging to Lashkar-e-Toiba and Harkatul Ansar, which are dominated by foreign mercenaries, and Hizbul Mujahideen have established bases in the twin border districts of Poonch and Rajouri. These militants have been infiltrating into the Poonch and Rajouri areas from across the border in small numbers. Several of them are being sent to Udhampur and Doda districts to extend the bases of insurgents.

During the past six months, activists of different militant outfits have fought pitched battles with the troops and other security agencies and killed more than 20 security personnel. That these mercenaries have been receiving support from local militants is indicated from yesterday’s incident as Zakir, the special police officer, is said to be a relative of top Lashkar-e-Toiba activists. Had it not been the case, the rival militants would have had no reason to kill the family members of Imtiyaz who had gunned down the SPO.","In a tragic incident in Udhampur, nine members of a community were killed in two incidents. The violence began when a militant, identified as Imtiyaz of Hizbul Mujahideen, killed special police officer Zakir. In retaliation, Lashkar-e-Toiba militants attacked Sailan village, killing three families who were relatives of Imtiyaz. The situation has led to heightened security measures in the area, with additional forces deployed and a manhunt launched for the perpetrators. The incident highlights ongoing tensions and clashes involving different militant outfits in the region, particularly in Poonch, Rajouri, Udhampur, and Doda districts.",Crime and Justice,92,335
The Tribune,1998-08-05 00:00:00,Massacres confirm Doda's dubious status,"The two massacres by militants in the upper reaches of Chamba area, in which more than 35 people were killed and several injured, have reconfirmed reports that Doda district has become a focal point for extending J-K insurgency into neighbouring Himachal Pradesh.

The two incidents are not the first of their kind. Militants have struck in the past in the upper reaches of Chamba bordering Bhaderwah tehsil of Doda district. The entire 40 km road between Bhaderwah and Ranikot and between Gandhov in Doda district to Chamba in Himachal and the surrounding hill belt extending between Chamba and Dharamshala, Basoli in Kathua to Dalhousie-Madhopur in Punjab and the south Kashmir belt via Kishtwar have no security cover. On these routes militants have roamed freely during the past two years.

Police authorities in Kashmir are of the opinion that a troubled Doda district could pose severe security problems for Himachal and Punjab besides the adjoining Kathua and Udhampur district of Jammu. Mounting anti-insurgency operations in Doda district is not as easy as in Kashmir. A vast zone extending several hundred km from Bhaderwah to Chamba, Kishtwar to Anantnag and from Doda to Udhampur has no motorable roads. It takes two days from Bhaderwah to the border of Chamba and more than six days from the tehsil headquarters of Doda district and Udhampur district to the mountain villages where militants have carved out safe havens.

Piecemeal operations against the militants have never proved effective and invariably resulted in casualties among the security forces.

From 1996 onwards there have been a string of massacres in Doda and Udhampur districts. In fact the trend of selective killings began in Doda district, spread to Udhampur and Rajouri and now to the Chamba area of Himachal.

Reports with the state Government reveal that large groups of militants, especially foreign mercenaries, have already sneaked into Chamba areas. They have been surveying the hillbelts and last nights carnage may not be the last unless security forces are deployed in strength in Doda district and the areas in Chamba that touch Bhaderwah. A few battalions of troops have been sent from Dalhousie for carrying out operations to flush out militants in the Chamba belt but these operations are unlikely to bear any results unless the security forces are directed to move from Bhaderwah and Basoli.

The situation calls for multi-directional operations according to police experts. Such operations cannot be possible with the limited number of companies of security forces posted in Doda district.","In the upper reaches of Chamba, two militant-led massacres resulting in over 35 deaths have highlighted the extension of J-K insurgency into Himachal Pradesh. Past incidents have confirmed this trend, especially in areas bordering Doda district. The lack of security cover along multiple routes has allowed militants to move freely, posing potential threats to neighboring regions. Police stress the challenges of anti-insurgency measures in these vast, remote zones and advocate for comprehensive operations, emphasizing the need for increased security forces to counteract militant activities effectively.",Local News,85,414
The Tribune,1998-08-05 00:00:00,Decision to defer Bill evokes mixed reaction," The Union Cabinet’s decision to defer the introduction of the Bill granting full statehood to Delhi has evoked mixed reaction from various political parties.

The BJP leaders of the Delhi unit have blamed the bureaucrats at the Centre for denying full statehood to Delhi by taking away the Chandni Chowk and NDMC areas from the actual National Capital Territory region as mooted by the party in its national agenda.

""What we had promised to the public was full statehood, not a city divided into three parts. After including it into the national agenda, we even took the issue for the Cabinet’s approval, but the Home Ministry bureaucrats have denied Delhiites the privilege of full statehood,"" said president of the BJP Delhi unit, Mr Mange Ram Garg, adding that without Chandni Chowk, Delhi won’t be the same. The Chief Minister, Mr Sahib Singh Verma, said, ""This is not what we had asked for from the Centre."" The CM said this was not what they had expected and their demand for statehood was genuine and the stay on the decision was unexpected.

Defending the city government’s objections to the Union Home Ministry’s plan to remove Red Fort and NDMC areas from the state, BJP leader O.P. Kohli said it could have created financial problems for businessmen living in different parts of the city and operating from Chandni Chowk or Connaught Place.

The president of the Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee, Mrs Sheila Dixit, said ""this is the typical style of the functioning of the BJP — they make big promises and at the last moment they back out of it. Even at the time they were talking of bringing this Bill in Parliament it was felt that there was no need for such a tearing hurry to bring about this Bill.""

Shoaib Iqbal, Janata Dal MLA, said ""the BJP has been totally exposed by this development. Earlier, they used to blame the Centre for all ills of the Capital. But now they have their own government both at the Centre and in Delhi. And now the internal differences within their own party have led to this situation. Had they introduced it in Parliament, the parties opposing the Bill would have been exposed.""","The Union Cabinet's delay in introducing the Bill for Delhi's full statehood has drawn varied reactions.

The proposed Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) seeks to replace FERA which was passed at a time when the country had a closed economy and foreign currency was regulated strictly by the Reserve Bank of India. In today’s economic scenario, when the country is close to moving toward full convertibility on capital account, there is substantial increase in foreign exchange reserves, growth in foreign trade and increased access to external commercial borrowings by Indian corporates, FERA has become outdated.

While liberalising the foreign exchange regulation regime, the government by moving the Bill on Prevention of Money Laundering hopes to check the misuse of the foreign exchange by Indians.","Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha introduced the Foreign Exchange Management Bill in the Lok Sabha, aiming to replace the outdated Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA) and the Prevention of Money Laundering Bill.

In the current economic climate, with India nearing full convertibility on capital account and experiencing growth in foreign trade and external commercial borrowings, FERA is deemed obsolete.

the tribune,1998-08-05 00:00:00,Should child labour be banned?,"Law prohibits child labour, human rights organisations decry the practice and the developed world shuns their products. Yet it’s a fact of life that can’t be wished away.

A ban on child labour will only push it underground like the world’s oldest profession, say trade unionists suggesting a more regulated and a better working environment instead.

Social activists are unwilling to buy it saying it would only make matters worse. Swami Agnivesh for one says: “A total ban on child labour is the only way to eliminate the problem from its roots.”

According to the Asia Labour Monitor report, at least 55 million children in India earn about 150 million a day which amounts to less than Rs 3 per child but contribute to more than one fifth of the total GNP of the country.

But as the children do not get even one-fifth of what they produce, they continue in poverty even as the family elders lose their bargaining power with employers who prefer cheap labour.

“We have come to a stage where we have to admit that withdrawing children from units is not the answer as it only heaps more misery on the child’s family,” says Mr P.K. Ganguly, national secretary of the Centre for Trade Unions (CITU).

“But we have to ensure that children are not made to work for more than six hours a day and are given a respectable wage along with free compulsory education,” he says.

“Offering better working conditions and a higher wage would only soften a burning issue and give the government more time to brood over the matter which will go against the cause”, says Swami Agnivesh demanding that the entire industry, including the victims, put pressure on the government to eliminate the problem.

Although unions are alert to the fact that fresh recruitments have to be nipped in the bud, they cite many loopholes in the existing legal system which makes immediate elimination a difficult task.

They say, as the Factory Act does not permit the employment of children, employers have entered into contracts and sub-contracts with middlemen who perpetuate the growth of child labour and at the same time satiate the needs of the industry.

The problem worsens in the unorganised sector where self-employed and home-based industries like bidi, handloom, agarbatti and brick-kiln escape from the clutches of the law.

Trade unions say that the existing laws are thus useless as employers will always devise ways and means to get cheap labour. The answer, therefore, lies in changing the employer’s attitude and urging them to provide decent working conditions.

But social activist Kailash Satyarthi working at the South Asian coalition on Child Servitude (SAACS) says “though it is difficult to eliminate child labour, it is not a utopian idea.”

“It is a misconception to link child labour with poverty. During the time of Independence, there were one crore child labourers and a corresponding one crore unemployed adults. Today, we have six crore child labourers and an equal number of unemployed adult population which means there is a parallel relation between the two.”

“And if we provide them with jobs, living conditions would improve too,” says Mr Satyarthi.

Employment of children has also led to the growth of black money as big industries like diamond cutting and polishing and handlooms save billions of rupees by showing accounts in which payments to adult workers are shown in lieu of the paltry salaries offered to children.

According to a CITU survey covering nine unorganised sectors like matchmaking, bidi rolling, bangle industry and small restaurants in 14 states, the children are paid a measly sum in lieu of long working hours and that sum is also handed over only to their parents.

Certain children are also forced to work without wages like 11-year-old Sahukat Ali who was rescued from a spices pounding unit and who is at present placed in a rehabilitation home.

“Initially, I worked in a biscuit factory where I slogged from 4 am to 1 am but due to ill treatment, I escaped from the unit. Subsequently, I worked in a spices pounding unit under suffocating conditions”, says Shaukat.

“But since the employer did not pay me wages for five months, I escaped from their clutches”, he says.","Despite laws prohibiting child labour and criticism from human rights organizations, the practice persists in India due to economic and social factors. Trade unionists advocate for regulated working conditions and better wages rather than a total ban, arguing that banning child labour could worsen poverty. Social activists, however, insist on a complete ban to eradicate the problem. The existing legal framework faces challenges, especially in the unorganized sector where child labour is prevalent. Some children work without pay, contributing to the growth of black money. Efforts to combat child labour require addressing both economic and social aspects, including providing employment opportunities for adults and improving living conditions. While opinions differ on the approach, there is consensus on the need to eliminate child labour and ensure the welfare of affected children.",social issues,130,708
THE TRIBUNE,1998-08-05 00:00:00,HC moved against cellular project,"NEW DELHI, Aug 4 (PTI) — The Delhi High Court today cautioned MTNL against purchasing equipment for its cellular telephone projects saying that such an investment would be at its own risk.

Acting on a petition filed by the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), Justice Anil Dev Singh issued notices to DoT and MTNL.“If MTNL purchases any equipment it can buy at its own risk and cost” the judge said while fixing September 18 for final disposal of the case.

The petition sought the quashing of the amendment to the MTNL licence which allowed it to offer cellular mobile telephone service (CMTS) in Delhi and Mumbai.Counsel for operators Manjul Bajpai clarified that this petition was not an appeal against the earlier order of the high court which paved the way for MTNL’s entry into cellular telephony market last month.

He said that the petition does not raise the issue of jurisdiction of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai).“The petitioners in this case—COAI and Hutchison Max Telecom Ltd — were in fact not a party to the earlier petition on the same issue filed with the Trai.” Bajpai said.

COAI counsel contended that MTNL cellular licence was issued without following any tendering process, was arbitrary and was a “gross abuse of powers by the government ...resulting in procedural impropriety, irrationality and illegality”.It was in violation of national telecom policy of 1994 and threatened the very existence of private operators, he added.

The operators apprehended that MTNL could use its interconnect revenues from four cellular operators in Delhi and Mumbai, which was Rs 136 crore in 1997-98, to subsidise its cellular service on a non-level playing field basis.They questioned the logic of MTNL investing Rs 1.070 crore in its Delhi and Mumbai at a time when spare capacity was available in networks of private cellular operators.

“This investment by MTNL at a time when there is an acute scarcity of foreign exchange due to economic sanctions is not called for. The entire cellular equipment will have to be imported by MTNL entailing the outgo of foreign exchange,” the operators said.MTNL will be able to offer more attractive packages by bundling both cellular and basic services, which private operators cannot do because they do not operate basic services, the COAI petition added.","The Delhi High Court cautioned MTNL against purchasing cellular equipment, pending a case filed by COAI challenging an amendment to MTNL's license. COAI argued the amendment was arbitrary and threatened private operators, alleging MTNL could use interconnect revenues to subsidize its service.

Denying that Indian soldiers also fired missiles in retaliation, he said there was no need to fire missiles from this side but ""our response has been very adequate.’’

On the reasons behind the sudden escalation in the firing from across the border, he said Pakistan’s motive was to push in militants into Kashmir to sustain trouble here.

""Our retaliation was aimed at silencing their guns and in the process foil Pakistan attempts to send intruders’’, he said.

""We have targeted Pakistan’s military installation in retaliation only,’’ he said.

The Sector Commander said it began on July 30 when Pakistani troops resorted to unprovoked firing and shelling on Indian positions and forward villages all along the 150-km long Baramulla sector.

""We exercised restraint but responded when civilian villages got affected’’, Brig Klair said.

He said it was amazing that most people in the affected villages near the line of control had not migrated to safer areas and were bravely facing Pakistani firing and shelling.

Meanwhile, 10 militants, a security jawan and two women were killed and 32 wounded as militants intensified their activities in the Kashmir valley since last evening.

The security forces foiled militants' attempt to trigger explosions and arrested two militants. Another laid down arms, an official spokesman said.

In Kupwara militants clashed with security forces and carried out targeted attacks against civilians, resulting in the death of seven militants and three civilians, including a woman.

Three foreign mercenaries and an equal number of local militants were killed by search parties at Rangwar Gali-Kalaroos and Rashanpora-Dardpora, while a militant, Farooq Ahmad Mir and a woman, Beeb Jan lost their lives and two were wounded in a fierce encounter between the militants and security forces at Awatkul-Kralpora in Kupwara district last night.

Five assault rifles, a pistol, 16 grenades, 5 kg of explosives and some ammunition were recovered from the dead militants.

Militants killed two persons including a retired head constable of the Jammu and Kashmir police, Ghulam Qadir, at Tapendi and Lolab (Kupwara) late last night.

Three militants were killed at Poshbagh-Ahalan village in Gadool area of Anantnag district. A militant who was injured in the encounter was arrested.","In escalating tensions along the Line of Control (LoC), at least 11 individuals, including eight security personnel, were killed, and 33 others injured due to Pakistani shelling since yesterday. The death toll in North Kashmir and Ladakh rises to 48 since Thursday. Heavy damage to civilian property occurred in Uri and Baramula districts, prompting migration to safer places. Pakistani troops fired thousands of rounds in various sectors. Authorities directed the Indian Oil Company to shift its depot from Jammu, while efforts were made to dissuade further migration from Uri. The intensity of Pakistani shelling in Baramulla sector is described as unusual. Militant activities also intensified in Kashmir, resulting in casualties.",Local News,110,1239

At any time we might be called upon to assume responsibilities"".

The politically significant statement came during her address at the customary end-of-the-session general body of the Congress Party in Parliament of which she is the Chairperson.

Describing the current Parliament session as the ""most unproductive monsoon session"" she said the government had revealed through this session, its inexperience, lack of direction, incoherence and internal distensions.

""There has been no governance, only a struggle for survival"", she said.

The Congress President said the instability of the government had not arisen from anything her party was doing but the ruling coalition's ""own internal quarrels"".

She said it was clear that the so-called national agenda for governance had brought about serious differences between the coalition partners. She said there had been no reconciliation of the policy.

""In these circumstances, the Congress has to be on the alert for any development in the medium or even short term. At any moment we might be called upon to assume responsibilities"", she said.

The Congress President asked the MPs to use the inter-session period to strengthen the party at the grassroots and advised them to interact with ordinary Congress workers.

On the Jain Commission reports, she said the truth about the assassinations must come out, what had been uncovered must be highlighted and what remained to be investigated should be probed.

Describing the issue as one which affected Congress workers deeply and emotionally, she said the MPs should educate the workers and people on what was contained in the Jain reports.

Referring to the recent Goa episode, she said, ""not only have we faced betrayal by those elected on our ticket, the Governor appointed by the government has shown bias and favouritism"".

She said politicisation of high constitutional office ""bodes ill for the future’’ and directed the MPs to be vigilant to forestall and expose the twisting of constitution by the government to serve its narrow ends.

Turning to the Assembly elections due in Madhya Pradesh, Mizoram, Delhi and Rajasthan, she asked them to work to replace the existing non-Congress governments in Delhi and Rajasthan while ensuring return in other two states.

""I sense resurgence for the Congress in the air. But atmospherics alone will not do. Hard work is required. These state Assembly elections are going to be a major pre-occupation of ours during the inter-sessional period"", she said.

She also touched upon the international issues and said between now and November, the country could witness disturbing developments on the international stage.

India, she said, could find itself in the dock at the UN General Assembly due to diplomatic errors of the government.

The Congress offered cooperation to the government in ensuring that ""India’s name is not tarnished and national interests are protected"", she said adding that regrettably, ""there is little indication that the government is taking the initiative to re-establish national consensus on the foreign and defence policy"".

She said national consensus would also be needed to face the UN General Assembly and the key questions would be Kashmir and nuclear weapons.

The Congress President also had a word of praise for the party MPs for maintaining decorum and reason even when the House was ""plunged in chaos. It is such good behaviour that persuades the country that the Congress is the natural party of governance, the party with which democracy is safe"".","During the end-of-session general body address in Parliament, Congress President Sonia Gandhi expressed concerns about the stability of the BJP-led coalition government, suggesting it could collapse due to internal conflicts. She urged Congress MPs to be vigilant and prepared for any development, emphasizing that her party might be called upon to assume responsibilities. Sonia Gandhi criticized the government's inexperience, lack of direction, and internal divisions, characterizing the recent parliamentary session as the ""most unproductive monsoon session.""

Nine members of a community were killed in two incidents in Udhampur today.

Reports reaching here said a militant identified as Imtiyaz killed special police officer Zakir, a former militant. This enraged activists of a rival outfit. Imtiyaz is said to belong to Hizbul Mujahideen. Activists of Lashkar-e-Toiba swooped on Sailan village and opened indiscriminate fire on the family members of Imtiyaz. Three families, all relatives of Imtiyaz, were killed and six critically wounded.

Additional security forces have been rushed to the area and a manhunt has been launched against the killers. The village has been cordoned amid wailing by members of both communities over the massacre of 20 persons, including children and women.

Zakir, according to reports, was dragged out of a bus and shot dead by Imtiyaz wanted in connection with several killings in the Poonch-Rajouri area.

In a swift retaliatory action, supporters of Zakir, armed with automatic weapons, stormed the houses of Imtiyaz’s sons — Hassan Mohammad, Ahmad Din and Lassa Sheikh — and fired indiscriminately, killing 11 girls, three minor boys, two women and three men.

The incident has confirmed reports that militants belonging to Lashkar-e-Toiba and Harkatul Ansar, which are dominated by foreign mercenaries, and Hizbul Mujahideen have established bases in the twin border districts of Poonch and Rajouri. These militants have been infiltrating into the Poonch and Rajouri areas from across the border in small numbers. Several of them are being sent to Udhampur and Doda districts to extend the bases of insurgents.

During the past six months, activists of different militant outfits have fought pitched battles with the troops and other security agencies and killed more than 20 security personnel. That these mercenaries have been receiving support from local militants is indicated from yesterday’s incident as Zakir, the special police officer, is said to be a relative of top Lashkar-e-Toiba activists. Had it not been the case, the rival militants would have had no reason to kill the family members of Imtiyaz who had gunned down the SPO.

Nine members of the minority community were killed by militants in two separate incidents near Mohare in the upper reaches of Udhampur and in a village near Ramban in Doda district. Eight houses were set ablaze at a place 7 km from Mohare in Udhampur.

Reports reaching here said militants equipped with automatic rifles swooped on the two villages and opened indiscriminate fire, killing nine persons, six near Mohare and three at Jarot village in Ramba area. After eliminating members of one community, they doused eight houses with kerosene and set these on fire.

A report from Srinagar said at least 24 persons, including 22 women, were injured in a grenade explosion at Clock Tower in Lal Chowk area this morning. One of them was seriously injured.

Eyewitnesses said the grenade was aimed at a security vehicle but it exploded on the road at about 11.25 a.m. The seriously injured, Suraya of Nowhatta locality in the capital city, has been admitted to hospital.

The injured pilgrims were identified as Pawan Kumar, Atma Ram, Rakesh (all from Chandigarh), Hemant Sai Ganpath (Maharashtra), Dooni Chand (Himachal Pradesh), Ram Pradesh (Bihar) and Ram Gopal (Rai Bareily-UP).

The Tribune,1998-08-05 00:00:00,NATO nod for Kosovo military plan,"NATO has approved plans to use firepower against the Serb forces in Kosovo, the Clinton Administration has said, adding its concern that the latest Serb offensive could generate a “humanitarian catastrophe” for tens of thousands of people forced to leave their homes.

The plans, focused on an aerial assault, are being fine-tuned by the NATO council, State Department officials said yesterday.

There was no immediate word on what would trigger an attack by NATO, US State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said that was up to President Bill Clinton and the other NATO political leaders. Nor was it clear whether this was mostly an attempt by the Administration to unnerve Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic by raising the threat again publicly.

The USA has raised the threat of bombing Serb forces in Kosovo several times since the current crisis erupted earlier this year. But Mr Milosevic has ignored the warnings, forcing the Administration to back down each time.

Mr Rubin did indicate an attack was not imminent, saying “further refinement is ongoing.”

And a NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity from the organisation’s headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, played down the possibility of military intervention, saying that at this stage NATO was simply putting the final touches on a number of possible actions in Kosovo and the region.

In Kosovo, a weekend of fighting displaced tens of thousands of people, some of them taking refuge in forests outside towns and now beyond the immediate reach of relief organisations. The UN relief agency estimated that 35,000 people fled their homes during the weekend. The Red Cross reported finding twice that number in one area alone.","NATO endorsed plans for potential airstrikes against Serb forces in Kosovo amid fears of a humanitarian crisis caused by the recent Serb offensive.

The BJP leaders of the Delhi unit have blamed the bureaucrats at the Centre for denying full statehood to Delhi by taking away the Chandni Chowk and NDMC areas from the actual National Capital Territory region as mooted by the party in its national agenda.

""What we had promised to the public was full statehood, not a city divided into three parts. After including it into the national agenda, we even took the issue for the Cabinet’s approval, but the Home Ministry bureaucrats have denied Delhiites the privilege of full statehood,"" said president of the BJP Delhi unit, Mr Mange Ram Garg, adding that without Chandni Chowk, Delhi won’t be the same. The Chief Minister, Mr Sahib Singh Verma, said, ""This is not what we had asked for from the Centre."" The CM said this was not what they had expected and their demand for statehood was genuine and the stay on the decision was unexpected.

Defending the city government’s objections to the Union Home Ministry’s plan to remove Red Fort and NDMC areas from the state, BJP leader O.P. Kohli said it could have created financial problems for businessmen living in different parts of the city and operating from Chandni Chowk or Connaught Place.

The president of the Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee, Mrs Sheila Dixit, said ""this is the typical style of the functioning of the BJP — they make big promises and at the last moment they back out of it. Even at the time they were talking of bringing this Bill in Parliament it was felt that there was no need for such a tearing hurry to bring about this Bill.""

Shoaib Iqbal, Janata Dal MLA, said ""the BJP has been totally exposed by this development. Earlier, they used to blame the Centre for all ills of the Capital.

The Tribune,1998-08-06 00:00:00,Package to boost sagging exports,"The Commerce Minister, Mr Ramakrishna Hegde, today announced in the Lok Sabha a package of measures, including cheaper export credit, to boost sluggish exports in the country.

Under the package, finalised in consultation with the Finance Ministry and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the rate of interest on pre- shipment credit and post-shipment has been slashed by 2 per cent. Exporters will now have to pay 9 per cent in place of 11 per cent. The lower interest rates will, however, be applicable only till the end of March 1999, as according to Mr Hegde it is only a ""special temporary facility.""

The new package comes at a time when the country’s export performance in the first quarter of this financial year has shown an 8 per cent negative growth in dollar terms. The trade deficit has widened to $ 2100 million during the period as against $ 1400 million in the corresponding period of the previous year.

In a bid to avoid harassment to exporters, the government has decided to pay interest to exporters if the government dues by way of duty drawback or refund of terminal excise duty were delayed beyond two months. This would come into operation from September 1 and prescribed documents have to be furnished within 15 days of export or deemed export.

In the case of duty drawback, this period would be reckoned from the date of shipping bill and in the case of terminal excise duty the period would be from the date of payment of duty.

In a bid to reduce the cost to exporters and to help augment working capital it has been decided that manufacturer-exporters with a record of specified performance and over one year of unblemished export record would be permitted the facility of legal undertakings instead of bank guarantee to the Customs as security for import of duty-free raw materials.

Exporters who are permitted to give bonds to excise and Customs bond officers would not be required hereafter to give separate bonds for fulfilment of different obligations but only a single mother bond on an annual basis which would subsume all bonds required to be given for various purposes. This would save time and expenses of the exporters, Mr Hegde said.

The minister also announced a number of promotional measures and procedural changes as suggested by exporters.

This includes extension of the tax holiday for export-oriented units (EOUs) and export processing zone units (EPZUs) from the present five years to 10 years.

Mr Hegde said the EOUs would be permitted sub-contracting facility in domestic tariff area and private software technology parks would be given the benefit of the export promotion capital goods (EPCG) scheme.

Exports through courier would be permitted from EPZs and a special package for hardware electronics would be finalised shortly, the minister said.

Bio-technology and small-scale engineering industry to be specified would also be entitled to the benefit of zero duty EPCG scheme under Rs 1 crore threshold limit.

It was also announced that manufacturer-exporters of specified turnover would hereafter be permitted clearance of goods on the basis of self-certification.

In a bid to give a boost to export of processed foods, horticultural and floricultural products, it has been decided that the duty on mobile cooling equipment and other cold chain equipment would be suitably revised to reduce the cost of such equipment.

Mr Hegde hoped that these measures would help the exporting community achieve an export growth of 20 per cent this year.","Commerce Minister Ramakrishna Hegde unveiled measures to bolster exports, addressing a negative growth of 8% in Q1 of the fiscal year. Key initiatives include a 2% interest rate cut on export credit until March 1999, prompt interest payment to exporters for delayed government dues, and allowing legal undertakings instead of bank guarantees for certain exporters. Other changes include tax holiday extension for export-oriented units to 10 years, sub-contracting for EOUs, and simplified clearance procedures. Hegde aimed for a 20% export growth and hinted at forthcoming incentives for hardware electronics and biotechnology sectors.",Business and Finance,92,580

The authorities have shifted the staff of Border Roads Organisation in Uri and that of the CISF to accommodate civilians, including government employees. Camps are being set up at Gantamulla and Sheeri in Baramulla for providing temporary shelter to migrants from Uri sector.

Reports said several border villages, including Kamalot, Gharkot Jabla, Salamabad and NS bridge, were hit by Pak shells in Uri sector. The Drass-Kargil road, which is within the Pak firing range, is under constant watch of the troops to prevent Pak shells from blowing up Army convoy or civilian trucks loaded with essential commodities.

URI (North Kashmir): The Army authorities have said the ""intensity’’ of the ongoing Pakistani shelling and firing on Indian positions in Baramulla sector is ""unusual’’ as missiles have also been fired.

""The firing used to be normal in this sector of North Kashmir but the intensity of the firing for the past six days is unusual’’, Brig U.S. Klair, Sector Commander of Baramulla said here on Tuesday.

Addressing mediapersons at the Baramulla headquarters before visiting Uri and forward areas, he said in all Pakistani troops fired 16,171 rounds and shells of artillery, mortars, rockets, 85 mm field guns and other weapons besides nine missiles on Indian positions and villages in the sector.

The missiles, anti-tank and guided missiles, having a range of 3,700 metres to 4 km, however, failed to hit any target, Brig Klair said.

Denying that Indian soldiers also fired missiles in retaliation, he said there was no need to fire missiles from this side but ""our response has been very adequate.’’

On the reasons behind the sudden escalation in the firing from across the border, he said Pakistan’s motive was to push in militants into Kashmir to sustain trouble here.

""Our retaliation was aimed at silencing their guns and in the process foil Pakistan attempts to send intruders’’, he said.

""We have targeted Pakistan’s military installation in retaliation only,’’ he said.

The Sector Commander said it began on July 30 when Pakistani troops resorted to unprovoked firing and shelling on Indian positions and forward villages all along the 150-km long Baramulla sector.

""We exercised restraint but responded when civilian villages got affected’’, Brig Klair said.

He said it was amazing that most people in the affected villages near the line of control had not migrated to safer areas and were bravely facing Pakistani firing and shelling.

Meanwhile, 10 militants, a security jawan and two women were killed and 32 wounded as militants intensified their activities in the Kashmir valley since last evening.

The security forces foiled militants' attempt to trigger explosions and arrested two militants. Another laid down arms, an official spokesman said.

In Kupwara militants clashed with security forces and carried out targeted attacks against civilians, resulting in the death of seven militants and three civilians, including a woman.

Three foreign mercenaries and an equal number of local militants were killed by search parties at Rangwar Gali-Kalaroos and Rashanpora-Dardpora, while a militant, Farooq Ahmad Mir and a woman, Beeb Jan lost their lives and two were wounded in a fierce encounter between the militants and security forces at Awatkul-Kralpora in Kupwara district last night.

The Tribune,1998-08-06 00:00:00,Govt to unravel 'whole truth' about Rajiv killing," In a categorical statement of its intent, the government today said it was determined to unravel the ""whole truth"" about the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, including aspects of ""wider conspiracy"" and involvement of foreign hand in it.

The Union Home Minister, Mr L.K. Advani, and the Urban Affairs Minister, Mr Ram Jethmalani, assured the Lok Sabha that the government would go all out to punish the culprits inside and outside the country. ""We will go into the depth of it to unravel the whole truth"", Mr Advani stressed.

Earlier, initiating a debate in the Lok Sabha on the Jain Commission findings on the conspiracy angle behind Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination, the Deputy Leader of the Congress, Mr P.Shiv Shanker, said his party had no reservation in accepting the Jain Commission report but it was not possible to accept the action taken report in any form.

Mr P. Shiv Shanker rejected the (ATR) of the Government on the findings of the Jain Commission of inquiry saying it was a political efforts to close the ranks of the ruling party and divide the Opposition.

Mr Advani assured the House that the government was committed to getting at the truth of the Rajiv Gandhi assassination and suggested that an executive body with statutory powers should be entrusted to follow up the report of the Jain Commission. Mr Advani was of the view that another judicial commission at this stage would not be useful.

In his introductory remarks, Mr Advani said the government would carry out further investigations to unravel the conspiracy behind the assassination of the Congress leader. The investigations would cover both the domestic and external angles, he added.

Mr Advani pointed out while preparing the ATR the government had ensured that it did not, in any way, upset the order of the designated court which had awarded an unprecedented capital punishment to 26 persons.

Mr Shiv Shanker, in his nearly 100-minute emotional speech, alleged that the ATR was more of an attempt by the bureaucrats to save themselves and expressed anguish over the fact that no bureaucrat had been punished or indicted in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case.

In a veiled criticism of former Prime Minister Mr P.V.Narasimha Rao, Mr Shanker said governments at the Centre after 1991 did not want the Jain Commission to find out the truth and put hurdles in its smooth functioning.

He alleged that certain forces within, including the Congress, and outside were against Rajiv Gandhi since the day he became Prime Minister and they wanted to replace him.

He said the Congress only wanted to arrive at the truth behind the assassination but the ATR did not lead it anywhere as only general observations had been made in it. He said the Jain Commission, despite doing an exemplary job, had not been able to find the other side of the dark tunnel.

He said there were several loose ends in the follow up and there was a need to go into several angles, including role of the bureaucrats, politicians, the alleged links of Godman Chandraswamy with the CIA and Mossad, and efforts by some people to wind up the Jain Commission.

He said the file regarding the winding up of the Jain Commission should be gone into.

Opposing the setting up of a multi-disciplinary monitoring agency (MDMA) under the CBI to further probe the matter, he pointed out that the CBI had not tried to investigate a single bureaucrat.

The debate generated considerable interest in the Congress circles and senior members, including Mr Arjun Singh and Mr M.L. Fotedar were seen sitting in the visitors galleries.

Mr Jethmalani, who was seen taking copious notes of Mr Shiv Shanker’s speech, assured the House that the government would sincerely probe the wider conspiracy in the assassination of the Congress leader and a possible foreign hand behind the LTTE.

He said the Ministries of External Affairs and Home and other agencies would examine the commission’s finding that involvement of a foreign hand with the LTTE in the conspiracy could not be ruled out.

He said the government would consider examining the ""conflicting evidence"" given by the then Prime Minister, Home Minister and Home Secretary before the Commission which he said could entail their prosecution on charges of perjury and destruction of evidence.

He defended the ATR tabled in Parliament along with the final report on July 31, and said the government had fully accepted the findings of the designated court and the commission’s report exonerating certain people, including former Prime Ministers.

Mr Jethmalani said the relaxation and withdrawal of security cover provided to Rajiv Gandhi would be one of the aspects of the probe and opined that the security cover for the former Prime Minister should never have been withdrawn.","The government pledges to uncover the ""whole truth"" behind Rajiv Gandhi's assassination, vowing to pursue both domestic and external angles. Home Minister L.K. Advani assures the Lok Sabha of a thorough investigation, rejecting the Action Taken Report (ATR) as inadequate. Congress Deputy Leader P. Shiv Shanker criticizes the ATR and calls for deeper scrutiny into bureaucratic and political roles. Urban Affairs Minister Ram Jethmalani promises a sincere probe into wider conspiracies and possible foreign involvement, advocating for examination of conflicting testimonies.

the tribune,1998-08-06 00:00:00,"Troops prepared, says Fernandes","The Defence Minister, Mr George Fernandes, today assured the Lok Sabha that the security forces guarding our borders in Jammu and Kashmir were in fine mettle and in full preparedness to meet every eventuality that might arise.

While making a statement in the House following his return from the forward areas of Jammu and Kashmir yesterday, the Defence Minister said Pakistan had always resorted to firing along the LoC to facilitate infiltration by Pakistani and foreign militants. These, he said, were organised, trained, equipped, financed, armed and finally infiltrated with active covering fire and support from the Pakistani army deployed along the LoC.

In recent months, especially since May 1998, our security forces had been able to intercept and reduce the level of infiltration, thereby frustrating Pakistan’s designs he said. As if to give vent to its frustration, Pakistan had started targeting not only our army posts but also civilian inhabited areas, with Batalik, Kargil, Kanzalwan, Tangdhar, Keren and Uri becoming the main targets.

These actions by Pakistan were in consonance with its calculated design to obstruct and stall peaceful bilateral dialogue and to create a sense of alarm by orchestrating incidents on the border which would project Jammu and Kashmir as a ‘flashpoint’. Pakistan’s desperation was becoming acute in view of the fast declining Kashmiri support in the valley to militancy, control of which had passed into the hands of Pakistani militant organisations, patronised by Pakistani political figures, and foreign mercenaries directed by Pakistan’s Inter Services Intelligence, he said.

""I do not have to emphasise that India had never engaged in any provocative action and had always desired that the international boundary and the Line of Control should be peaceful and tranquil. India has exercised the utmost restraint and will continue to do so. We expect Pakistan to reciprocate. We also expect that the established diplomatic and military channels will be effectively utilised to prevent such incidents.""

He informed that Pakistan had resorted to unprecedented and unprovoked firing of artillery and mortars on our posts and in the civilian areas of Batalik and Karkil from July 27. As a result India was compelled to retaliate appropriately and this resulted in casualties to civilians and troops, as well as damage to military and civilian property on both sides.

the tribune,1998-08-06 00:00:00,Govt to unravel 'whole truth' about Rajiv killing,"In a categorical statement of its intent, the government today said it was determined to unravel the ""whole truth"" about the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, including aspects of ""wider conspiracy"" and involvement of foreign hand in it.

The Union Home Minister, Mr L.K. Advani, and the Urban Affairs Minister, Mr Ram Jethmalani, assured the Lok Sabha that the government would go all out to punish the culprits inside and outside the country. ""We will go into the depth of it to unravel the whole truth"", Mr Advani stressed.

Earlier, initiating a debate in the Lok Sabha on the Jain Commission findings on the conspiracy angle behind Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination, the Deputy Leader of the Congress, Mr P.Shiv Shanker, said his party had no reservation in accepting the Jain Commission report but it was not possible to accept the action taken report in any form.

Mr P. Shiv Shanker rejected the (ATR) of the Government on the findings of the Jain Commission of inquiry saying it was a political efforts to close the ranks of the ruling party and divide the Opposition.

Mr Advani assured the House that the government was committed to getting at the truth of the Rajiv Gandhi assassination and suggested that an executive body with statutory powers should be entrusted to follow up the report of the Jain Commission. Mr Advani was of the view that another judicial commission at this stage would not be useful.

In his introductory remarks, Mr Advani said the government would carry out further investigations to unravel the conspiracy behind the assassination of the Congress leader. The investigations would cover both the domestic and external angles, he added.

Mr Advani pointed out while preparing the ATR the government had ensured that it did not, in any way, upset the order of the designated court which had awarded an unprecedented capital punishment to 26 persons.

Mr Shiv Shanker, in his nearly 100-minute emotional speech, alleged that the ATR was more of an attempt by the bureaucrats to save themselves and expressed anguish over the fact that no bureaucrat had been punished or indicted in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case.

In a veiled criticism of former Prime Minister Mr P.V.Narasimha Rao, Mr Shanker said governments at the Centre after 1991 did not want the Jain Commission to find out the truth and put hurdles in its smooth functioning.

He alleged that certain forces within, including the Congress, and outside were against Rajiv Gandhi since the day he became Prime Minister and they wanted to replace him.

He said the Congress only wanted to arrive at the truth behind the assassination but the ATR did not lead it anywhere as only general observations had been made in it. He said the Jain Commission, despite doing an exemplary job, had not been able to find the other side of the dark tunnel.

He said there were several loose ends in the follow up and there was a need to go into several angles, including role of the bureaucrats, politicians, the alleged links of Godman Chandraswamy with the CIA and Mossad, and efforts by some people to wind up the Jain Commission.

He said the file regarding the winding up of the Jain Commission should be gone into.

Opposing the setting up of a multi-disciplinary monitoring agency (MDMA) under the CBI to further probe the matter, he pointed out that the CBI had not tried to investigate a single bureaucrat.

The debate generated considerable interest in the Congress circles and senior members, including Mr Arjun Singh and Mr M.L. Fotedar were seen sitting in the visitors galleries.

Mr Jethmalani, who was seen taking copious notes of Mr Shiv Shanker’s speech, assured the House that the government would sincerely probe the wider conspiracy in the assassination of the Congress leader and a possible foreign hand behind the LTTE.

He said the Ministries of External Affairs and Home and other agencies would examine the commission’s finding that involvement of a foreign hand with the LTTE in the conspiracy could not be ruled out.

He said the government would consider examining the ""conflicting evidence"" given by the then Prime Minister, Home Minister and Home Secretary before the Commission which he said could entail their prosecution on charges of perjury and destruction of evidence.

He defended the ATR tabled in Parliament along with the final report on July 31, and said the government had fully accepted the findings of the designated court and the commission’s report exonerating certain people, including former Prime Ministers.

Mr Jethmalani said the relaxation and withdrawal of security cover provided to Rajiv Gandhi would be one of the aspects of the probe and opined that the security cover for the former Prime Minister should never have been withdrawn.","The Indian government has pledged to uncover the ""whole truth"" about the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, including allegations of a wider conspiracy and foreign involvement. Union Home Minister L.K. Advani and Urban Affairs Minister Ram Jethmalani assured the Lok Sabha that the government would punish those involved both inside and outside the country. Deputy Leader of the Congress, P.Shiv Shanker, rejected the Jain Commission's findings, claiming it was a political effort to divide the opposition. Advani assured the House that the government was committed to finding the truth and suggested an executive body with statutory powers to follow up the Jain Commission's report.

The Tribune,1998-08-06 00:00:00,11 killed in fresh Pak shelling," In the continued heavy shelling and firing by Pakistani troops along the Line of Control at least 11 persons, including eight securitymen, have been killed and 33 others injured since yesterday. With this the death toll due to Pakistani firing along the LoC in north Kashmir and Ladakh region has gone up to 48 since Thursday.

Defence sources here confirmed the death of Captain Gautam Groon in the Kupwara sector today. He was injured in the firing from across the LoC yesterday and succumbed to his injuries this morning. An Army jawan was also killed in Uri sector today.

Heavy damage to civilian property has been caused in various areas along the LoC in Uri and Baramula districts of north Kashmir. A large number of persons from more than 100 villages in these areas have moved to safer places. While some of these have shifted to the places of their relatives, others have shifted to the government installations with the help of the police and security forces.

At least eight Army men including one captain, were wounded in the firing by the Pakistani troops in Kupwara and Uri sectors between Tuesday and Wednesday morning. As many as 33 civilians were also injured in these two sectors till this morning, according to the reports here.

There have also been reports of firing in Siachen and Kargil sectors in the frontier cold desert region of Ladakh during the last night. However, there were no reports of any injury or damage to property in these incidents.

Defence sources here revealed that Pakistani troops fired 3000 to 4000 rounds of artillery in the Uri sector while 1200 rounds were fired in Kupwara sector yesterday. Last night the Pakistani troops fired 200 rounds of artillery and over 220 rounds of small arms in the Uri sector. However, there were no reports of any damage or casualty.

Three civilians, including two women, were killed in the Jabla area of Uri sector yesterday. They have been identified as Kounsar Ara, Shamima and Sattar Ali. At least 18 others were also injured due to Pakistani shelling in the village, reports said.

Four jawans of the BSF were also killed in the firing from across the Line of Control in the area. Two soldiers were killed in the Uri sector yesterday in Pakistani firing, while six jawans were also injured in the firing. One soldier and 15 civilians were injured in Kupwara sector.

Reports of firing by Pakistani troops have also come in from Kachchal, Machchil, Kanzalwan and Tangdhar sectors of Kupwara district. Defence sources here said that Pakistani troops fired at least 500 rounds of artillery in these sectors, while 2500 rounds of small arms were also fired. A captain was injured in the firing at Chamalkote in Kupwara sector.

Nine persons were injured in Paranda village of the Karna sector in Kupwara district while two others were injured in Machchil sector, the police here today said.

Indian Oil Company has been directed to shift its depot from Jammu. Over 18,000 filled cylinders have been removed from the town to prevent Pak troops from blowing up the depot.

Since yesterday the civil and Army authorities have been trying to stop further migration from Uri where several government offices and banks have been closed. More than 20 families of employees have been insisting on migration to safer places, but the civil and Army authorities have been persuading them to remain back and operate under security cover.

The Buniyar-Uri road is being kept under strict Army watch to keep the route open for movement of security forces and for carrying supplies to troops posted in forward areas. However, civilian movement has been restricted.

In Gurez, Tangdhar and Karnah areas people have migrated to safer places and more than 25 villages cleared of civilian population. All 35 families in Amori village in Tangdhar have migrated towards Bandipore.

The authorities have shifted the staff of Border Roads Organisation in Uri and that of the CISF to accommodate civilians, including government employees. Camps are being set up at Gantamulla and Sheeri in Baramulla for providing temporary shelter to migrants from Uri sector.

Reports said several border villages, including Kamalot, Gharkot Jabla, Salamabad and NS bridge, were hit by Pak shells in Uri sector. The Drass-Kargil road, which is within the Pak firing range, is under constant watch of the troops to prevent Pak shells from blowing up Army convoy or civilian trucks loaded with essential commodities.

URI (North Kashmir): The Army authorities have said the ""intensity’’ of the ongoing Pakistani shelling and firing on Indian positions in Baramulla sector is ""unusual’’ as missiles have also been fired.

""The firing used to be normal in this sector of North Kashmir but the intensity of the firing for the past six days is unusual’’, Brig U.S. Klair, Sector Commander of Baramulla said here on Tuesday.

Addressing mediapersons at the Baramulla headquarters before visiting Uri and forward areas, he said in all Pakistani troops fired 16,171 rounds and shells of artillery, mortars, rockets, 85 mm field guns and other weapons besides nine missiles on Indian positions and villages in the sector.

The missiles, anti-tank and guided missiles, having a range of 3,700 metres to 4 km, however, failed to hit any target, Brig Klair said.

Denying that Indian soldiers also fired missiles in retaliation, he said there was no need to fire missiles from this side but ""our response has been very adequate.’’

On the reasons behind the sudden escalation in the firing from across the border, he said Pakistan’s motive was to push in militants into Kashmir to sustain trouble here.

""Our retaliation was aimed at silencing their guns and in the process foil Pakistan attempts to send intruders’’, he said.

""We have targeted Pakistan’s military installation in retaliation only,’’ he said.

The Sector Commander said it began on July 30 when Pakistani troops resorted to unprovoked firing and shelling on Indian positions and forward villages all along the 150-km long Baramulla sector.

""We exercised restraint but responded when civilian villages got affected’’, Brig Klair said.

He said it was amazing that most people in the affected villages near the line of control had not migrated to safer areas and were bravely facing Pakistani firing and shelling.

Meanwhile, 10 militants, a security jawan and two women were killed and 32 wounded as militants intensified their activities in the Kashmir valley since last evening.

The security forces foiled militants' attempt to trigger explosions and arrested two militants. Another laid down arms, an official spokesman said.

In Kupwara militants clashed with security forces and carried out targeted attacks against civilians, resulting in the death of seven militants and three civilians, including a woman.

Three foreign mercenaries and an equal number of local militants were killed by search parties at Rangwar Gali-Kalaroos and Rashanpora-Dardpora, while a militant, Farooq Ahmad Mir and a woman, Beeb Jan lost their lives and two were wounded in a fierce encounter between the militants and security forces at Awatkul-Kralpora in Kupwara district last night.

Five assault rifles, a pistol, 16 grenades, 5 kg of explosives and some ammunition were recovered from the dead militants.

Militants killed two persons including a retired head constable of the Jammu and Kashmir police, Ghulam Qadir, at Tapendi and Lolab (Kupwara) late last night.

Three militants were killed at Poshbagh-Ahalan village in Gadool area of Anantnag district. A militant who was injured in the encounter was arrested.","At least 11 people, including eight security personnel, were killed and 33 others injured in continued heavy shelling and firing by Pakistani troops along the Line of Control, bringing the death toll to 48 since Thursday. Civilian properties were heavily damaged in Uri and Baramulla districts. Deployment of forces increased in Kishtwar. Pakistani troops fired thousands of rounds in Uri and Kupwara sectors.

The Tribune,1998-08-06 00:00:00,Bofors case: HC clears decks to arrest Quattrocchi,"Decks were cleared for the arrest of Italian businessman Ottavio Quattrocchi with the Delhi High Court today rejecting his plea for quashing an arrest warrant issued against him in the Rs 14.37-billion Bofors gun deal in which he allegedly got a kickback of $ 7.34 million.

A Division Bench comprising Mr Justice Devinder Gupta and Justice N.G. Nandi upheld the arrest warrant issued against Quattrocchi by the trial court and said it was up to the CBI to execute the arrest warrant in accordance with the law.

A special judge had issued on February 6 last year the non-bailable arrest warrant (NBW) against Quattrocchi, who at present is residing in Malaysia, on the request of the CBI which is probing the kickbacks paid in the 155 mm Howitzer field Bofors guns purchased from AE Services in Sweden.

The Bench in its over 70-page judgement also rejected the plea of Quattrocchi, who was allegedly close to the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, to quash the red alert issued by Interpol.

The Bench said the special judge had powers to issue the arrest warrants as he was satisfied from the records that there was ""prima facie evidence"" of Quattrocchi’s involvement in the gun deal kickbacks case.

The red corner notice was issued by Interpol on February 17 last year, 11 days after the issuance of the NBW.

Opposing the anticipatory bail plea of Quattrocchi, the CBI had informed the high court that it had plans to chargesheet the Italian businesman, former External Affairs Minister Madhav Sinh Solanki, former defence secretary S.K. Bhatnagar and Gopi Krishan Arora for their alleged involvement in the gun deal.

The agency had said investigations showed that the families of the then Prime Minister of India (Rajiv Gandhi) and Quattrocchi were ""on very intimate terms with each other"" and Quattrocchi was able to project himself as a person of great influence.

The CBI had said, ""It is clear from the documents received by the agency from Swiss authorities in January 1997 that he is the beneficiary of the moneys paid into AE Services account, the first instalment of which alone was US $ 7.34 million.""

Tracing the route of payment of commission by AB Bofors from the account of AE Services to two other joint accounts of Quattrocchi and his wife Maria, the CBI had said, ""It is therefore clear that AE Services is none other than Quattrocchi’s front company... investigation proceedings were launched to break the front of this company (Inter Investment Development Co.) to find out the ultimate destination of these funds"".","
The Delhi High Court rejected Italian businessman Ottavio Quattrocchi's plea to quash an arrest warrant in the Rs 14.37-billion Bofors gun deal. The court upheld the warrant issued by a special judge, allowing the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to execute it in accordance with the law. The arrest warrant, issued on February 6 the previous year, relates to kickbacks in the Bofors guns deal, where Quattrocchi allegedly received $7.34 million. The court also dismissed Quattrocchi's request to quash the red alert issued by Interpol. The CBI opposed Quattrocchi's anticipatory bail, revealing plans to chargesheet him, along with Madhav Sinh Solanki, S.K. Bhatnagar, and Gopi Krishan Arora, in connection with the gun deal. The CBI argued that Quattrocchi benefited from the funds paid into AE Services' account.",National News,127,426
THE TRIBUNE,1998-08-06 00:00:00,Butler’s talks with Iraq collapse,"DUBAI, Aug 4 (PTI) — A fresh UN-Iraq standoff loomed today as Chief UN Weapons Inspector Richard Butler cut short his visit to Baghdad following collapse of the talks on further investigations into Iraq’s alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction.

“My duty is to report what has happened to the security council and the United Nations,” television networks quoted Mr Butler as saying. “I’m going to New York to do that.”

Earlier after meeting Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, Mr Butler had said he did not know whether the talks would continue and that they could be suspended.

Mr Aziz on the other hand, said he did not see any point in deciding on a programme of action if UNSCOM was still up to its “old tricks”. Observers have no doubt that Mr Butler would report that Iraq had refused to cooperate with the UN weapons inspectors’ investigations, which may bring about yet another stand-off with the USA.

Reuters adds from Manama: Mr Butler said Iraq had rejected his proposal to extend his work on missile and chemical weapons for another month and instead demanded he close his files immediately.

Mr Butler, who cut short his Baghdad visit, said on arrival in Bahrain that the request was submitted to him by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz during talks in the Iraqi capital.","Chief UN Weapons Inspector Richard Butler cut short his visit to Baghdad after talks collapsed on further investigations into Iraq’s alleged weapons of mass destruction.

The Tribune,1998-08-06 00:00:00,Nuclear test ban talks on: PM," India is seeking international recognition for its declared moratorium on nuclear tests, which is akin to adherence to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), the Prime Minister, Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee, told the Lok Sabha today.

Ways and means for achieving ""de jure formalisation"" of the country’s voluntary undertakings are being explored through bilateral discussions with key interlocutors, the Prime Minister said while replying to a short duration discussion on the country’s foreign policy initiated in the House yesterday.

""India remains committed to this dialogue with a view to arriving at a decision regarding adherence to the CTBT,"" Mr Vajpayee said. ""These dialogues have been undertaken after satisfying ourselves that India no longer requires to undertake nuclear explosions. We can maintain the credibility of our nuclear deterrent in the future without testing,"" the Prime Minister said.

He said even while announcing a moratorium on further tests, India reserved the right to review this decision if in its judgement extraordinary events take place that jeopardise the country’s supreme national interests. The CTBT also gives the same right to every country.

Mr Vajpayee said in 1996, India stayed out of the CTBT because of national security interests and that remained unaltered.

The Prime Minister said it was not correct to say that India had got isolated in the international community after the Pokhran 11 tests. The importance India got at Manila, and SAARC meeting were a clear pointer to the fact that India had not been isolated.

He dismissed the insinuation that India had exploded nuclear devices to ensure a permanent seat in the U.N. Security Council saying it was India’s natural right.

In an apparent reference to the nuclear powers, the Prime Minister said those who preach should first look at themselves. A time-bound destruction of nuclear weapons was the only solution, he added.

He reiterated that India had not gone nuclear for the sake of aggression and it was done for the sake of the country’s safety and security. ""Deterrent and that too a minimum deterrent is the basis of our policy,"" Mr Vajpayee said.

On the contention of some of the Opposition members that economic might and not military might was the necessity of the day, Mr Vajpayee said there was no conflict whatsoever between economic prosperity and national security. He said it was his government’s endeavour that both economic prosperity and national security should go hand in hand.

The Prime Minister said there was no connection between the nuclear tests and the rising prices of essential commodities. It is ridiculous to link tomato prices with the Pokhran nuclear explosions, he said.

Speaking at length on Indo-Pakistan relations, Mr Vajpayee said the two countries should put contentious issues on the backburner and focus on other areas like economic cooperation to normalise relations.

He said such an approach with China had worked and there was no reason why it should not succeed with Pakistan. Mr Vajpayee felt that once relations normalise it would be easy to tackle contentious issues.

The Prime Minister also charged Pakistan with showing no interest in continuing bilateral talks for resolving outstanding issues. He said the Pakistan side had distributed statements during his talks with Mr Nawaz Sharif in Colombo and this showed they were not interested in the success of the talks.

He said Pakistan’s efforts to internationalise the Kashmir issue had failed as all the countries, including China, recognised India’s position that it was a bilateral matter. Its efforts to link Kashmir with nuclear weapons non-proliferation had also not cut ice as the two issues were poles apart. Mr Vajpayee rejected Islamabad’s suggestion that New Delhi should hold talks with the Hurriyat leaders.

He said Pakistan was not able to swallow the fact that a predominantly Muslim state was an integral part of India and all the efforts of its administrators were concentrated on internationalising the Kashmir issue.

He said in spite of Pakistan’s attitude, India would continue its efforts to improve relations with that country.

Mr Vajpayee said the talks with the Chinese representative at Manila some of the misunderstandings which had cropped up of late.

He said China had been told not to go merely by press reports. He denied that the Defence Minister, Mr George Fernandes, had said that China was a ""threat number one"" to India.

While admitting that there were some issues between the two countries which had to be resolved, Mr Vajpayee said India was committed to having friendly ties with Beijing.","Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee informed the Lok Sabha that India is seeking international recognition for its voluntary moratorium on nuclear tests, similar to adherence to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). Bilateral discussions are underway to explore ways for formalizing this commitment. Vajpayee emphasized India's commitment to dialogue on CTBT adherence and clarified that India reserved the right to review the moratorium if national interests were jeopardized. He rejected claims of isolation post-Pokhran II, highlighting India's significance at international meetings. Vajpayee urged normalizing Indo-Pak relations, emphasizing economic cooperation and dismissing Pakistan's efforts to internationalize the Kashmir issue.",Science and Technology,98,744
The Tribune,1998-08-07 00:00:00,SAD ultimatum to BJP on Udham Singh Nagar issue,"The Political Affairs Committee (PAC) of the Shiromani Akali Dal today unanimously decided to ""withdraw support"" to the Bharatiya Janata Party-led coalition government in New Delhi, if Udham Singh Nagar District was not excluded from the proposed hill state of Uttaranchal.

Briefing newspersons after a three-hour meeting of the PAC held at the SAD President's residence, Mr Parkash Singh Badal said the party was still ""hopeful"" that it would succeed in its efforts to keep Udham Singh Nagar district out of the new hill state. Along with other allies, the SAD would continue to make efforts till the very end to achieve what it had demanded, as per the wishes of the people of Udham Singh Nagar.

The SAD would continue to oppose ""tooth and nail"" the inclusion of Udham Singh Nagar in Uttaranchal with ""fierce determination"" and all force at its command. If despite all its attempts it failed, the SAD would have no option but to ""pull out"" of the 13-member coalition.

""Friendship"" he said, ""with the BJP is one thing. But commitment to our own people and duty to uphold their aspirations and wishes comes first and above everything else.""

Despite Mr Surjit Singh Barnala being a signatory to the Cabinet decision conveyed to the President on Uttaranchal state with Udham Singh Nagar district included, Mr Parkash Singh said he (Mr Surjit Singh) had endorsed the PAC decision taken today. What had happened was owing to a ""communication gap"".

Besides the PAC members several members of Parliament, including Mr Satnam Singh Kainth of Bahujan Samaj Morcha, attended the meeting.

Mr Parkash Singh said ""unconditional"" support to the BJP was meant to convey that ""petty issues"" would not be allowed to cloud the relationship between the two. Udham Singh Nagar issue was important. He said he did not deny that there were other ""equally important"" issues concerning Punjab. ""But then there is always a proper time for an issue to be taken up. The priority at present is Udham Singh Nagar,"" he added.

The PAC held detailed discussions. It had met in an atmosphere of ""shock and sadness"" given the attitude of the BJP though the SAD had repeatedly expressed its opinion and views, including furnishing the opinion of legal and constitutional experts.

The adamant attitude of the BJP has, perhaps, made the SAD take a somewhat tough stand. That it did not outright recall its two Ministers, Mr Surjit Singh Barnala and Mr Sukhbir Singh Badal, from the Union Council of Ministers indicates that the SAD will ""act and react"" logically; not in haste, despite the big challenge it faces to put up a brave face before its own political constituents.

Not only is the SAD determined on its demand but Mr Parkash Singh said even the people of Udham Singh Nagar district had held ‘bandhs’ and ‘dharnas’ and protested being included in the proposed hill state. Nearly 95 per cent village panchayats had passed resolutions to oppose being pushed into Uttaranchal. As many as 275 out of 328 panchayats were opposed to going into Uttaranchal.

The SAD had had several talks with BJP leaders including the Prime Minister and the Home Minister. Reasons why Udham Singh Nagar should be kept out were cogently given. Yet the Cabinet recommendation to the President did not taken cognisance of the SAD demand. This has piqued the SAD.

The SAD would align with regional parties within the coalition to demand status quo for Udham Singh Nagar. Mr Parkash Singh clarified that the SAD was not opposed to Uttaranchal state as such. But it was against the inclusion of Udham Singh Nagar. Therefore, at every step the party would work overtime against pushing Udham Singh Nagar into Uttaranchal state. That includes voting against the Bill in its present form.

The PAC comprises the following 13 members, including the Chief Minister, Mr Parkash Singh Badal, Mr Gurcharan Singh Tohra, Mr Ravi Inder Singh, Mr Surjan Singh Thekedar, Mr Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, Mr Balwinder Singh Bhunder, Mr Gurdev Singh Badal, Mr Ranjit Singh Brahmpura, Mr Parkash Singh Majitha, Mr Seva Singh Sekhwan, Mr Jagdev Singh Talwandi, Mr Surjit Singh Barnala and Capt Kanwaljit Singh.

This is the second time the PAC had met on the same issue — Udham Singh Nagar — earlier, it had met on July 5 when it had only ""warned"" the BJP of the ""consequences"" with countrywide ramifications. It had talked of ""grave concern"" and ""protested"" over the BJP approach and attitude to the issue. The SAD President had led a delegation to the Prime Minister and the Home Minister. There was no tangible result. That ""warning"" has now been converted into a ""decision"" vis-a-vis SAD support to the BJP-led coalition government.

The SAD was clear when it earlier told the BJP that in case the demand on Udham Singh Nagar was ignored or brushed aside it would be difficult for the SAD to ensure the same level of Sikh voters' support in other states. ""After all the SAD must have a face to show as to why it has aligned with the BJP"", said an insider. Thus, today's PAC decision signals the beginning of new ""turns and twists"" in the relationship between the two parties, say observers.

Meanwhile, the developments in Hardwar, which observed a ‘bandh’ on Wednesday has further strengthened the SAD stand. Hardwar is opposed to its inclusion in Uttaranchal.back

 	
No threat to govt, asserts BJP

Tribune News Service

NEW DELHI, Aug 6 — The Bharatiya Janata Party today asserted that the Vajpayee government was not in any danger stressing that the Udham Singh Nagar issue raised by the Akali Dal would be ""resolved amicably"".

Replying to a host of questions on the reported Akali Dal threat to withdraw support on inclusion of the district of Udham Singh Nagar in the proposed state of Uttaranchal, the BJP general secretary, Mr M.Venkaiah Naidu, said ""we have taken note of it and have conveyed to the Prime Minister"". The Prime Minister would take an initiative and talk to Akali Dal leaders for finding a solution to the problem, Mr Naidu said adding that ""we will not join issue publicly with any of our allies"". The issue may also figure at the coordination committee meeting which is scheduled to take place this month, he said.

""We are confident that we will be able to sort out the problem amicably"", the BJP leader said adding that ""nobody is threatening us"". ""It is an emotive issue for the Akali Dal"", he said.

Elaborating further, Mr Naidu said smooth functioning of the government was a joint responsibility of all of us and ""it will be our common endeavour to resolve all the problems"". We have to go by consensus, he said.

When asked if the BJP leadership was in touch with the Akali Dal on the Udham Singh Nagar issue drafting the proposed Uttaranchal Bill, Mr Naidu said:"" We are in regular touch. We have Akali Dal ministers.""

When asked about the Akali Dal’s threat to withdraw their ministers, Mr Naidu said the Prime Minister would talk to the Akali Dal leadership.

Other allies of the BJP,when contacted by TNS, declined to comment on the Akali Dal’s threat to withdraw support.

Asked to comment on newspaper reports that the Akali Dal might pull out of the government on the issue of inclusion of Udham Singh Nagar in proposed Uttaranchal, Mrs Sushma Swaraj said ""such an eventuality would not arise"" claiming the BJP and the Akali Dal were ""in full coordination"" on the issue","The Shiromani Akali Dal's Political Affairs Committee unanimously decided to withdraw support from the BJP-led coalition government if Udham Singh Nagar District wasn't excluded from the proposed hill state of Uttaranchal.

The SAD would align with regional parties within the coalition to demand status quo for Udham Singh Nagar. Mr Parkash Singh clarified that the SAD was not opposed to Uttaranchal state as such. But it was against the inclusion of Udham Singh Nagar. Therefore, at every step the party would work overtime against pushing Udham Singh Nagar into Uttaranchal state. That includes voting against the Bill in its present form.

The PAC comprises the following 13 members, including the Chief Minister, Mr Parkash Singh Badal, Mr Gurcharan Singh Tohra, Mr Ravi Inder Singh, Mr Surjan Singh Thekedar, Mr Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, Mr Balwinder Singh Bhunder, Mr Gurdev Singh Badal, Mr Ranjit Singh Brahmpura, Mr Parkash Singh Majitha, Mr Seva Singh Sekhwan, Mr Jagdev Singh Talwandi, Mr Surjit Singh Barnala and Capt Kanwaljit Singh.

This is the second time the PAC had met on the same issue — Udham Singh Nagar — earlier, it had met on July 5 when it had only ""warned"" the BJP of the ""consequences"" with countrywide ramifications. It had talked of ""grave concern"" and ""protested"" over the BJP approach and attitude to the issue. The SAD President had led a delegation to the Prime Minister and the Home Minister. There was no tangible result. That ""warning"" has now been converted into a ""decision"" vis-a-vis SAD support to the BJP-led coalition government.

The SAD was clear when it earlier told the BJP that in case the demand on Udham Singh Nagar was ignored or brushed aside it would be difficult for the SAD to ensure the same level of Sikh voters' support in other states. ""After all the SAD must have a face to show as to why it has aligned with the BJP"", said an insider. Thus, today's PAC decision signals the beginning of new ""turns and twists"" in the relationship between the two parties, say observers.

Meanwhile, the developments in Hardwar, which observed a ‘bandh’ on Wednesday has further strengthened the SAD stand. Hardwar is opposed to its inclusion in Uttaranchal.","The Shiromani Akali Dal's Political Affairs Committee (PAC) unanimously decided to withdraw support from the BJP-led coalition government in New Delhi if Udham Singh Nagar District was not excluded from the proposed hill state of Uttaranchal. The SAD, while still hopeful for a favorable outcome, stated it would oppose the inclusion of Udham Singh Nagar with determination. The party emphasized its commitment to the aspirations of the people of Udham Singh Nagar and prioritized their wishes over its alliance with the BJP.

The Tribune,1998-08-07 00:00:00,SAD ultimatum to BJP on Udham Singh Nagar issue,"The Political Affairs Committee (PAC) of the Shiromani Akali Dal today unanimously decided to ""withdraw support"" to the Bharatiya Janata Party-led coalition government in New Delhi, if Udham Singh Nagar District was not excluded from the proposed hill state of Uttaranchal.

Briefing newspersons after a three-hour meeting of the PAC held at the SAD President's residence, Mr Parkash Singh Badal said the party was still ""hopeful"" that it would succeed in its efforts to keep Udham Singh Nagar district out of the new hill state. Along with other allies, the SAD would continue to make efforts till the very end to achieve what it had demanded, as per the wishes of the people of Udham Singh Nagar.

The SAD would continue to oppose ""tooth and nail"" the inclusion of Udham Singh Nagar in Uttaranchal with ""fierce determination"" and all force at its command. If despite all its attempts it failed, the SAD would have no option but to ""pull out"" of the 13-member coalition.

""Friendship"" he said, ""with the BJP is one thing. But commitment to our own people and duty to uphold their aspirations and wishes comes first and above everything else.""

Despite Mr Surjit Singh Barnala being a signatory to the Cabinet decision conveyed to the President on Uttaranchal state with Udham Singh Nagar district included, Mr Parkash Singh said he (Mr Surjit Singh) had endorsed the PAC decision taken today. What had happened was owing to a ""communication gap"".

Besides the PAC members several members of Parliament, including Mr Satnam Singh Kainth of Bahujan Samaj Morcha, attended the meeting.

Mr Parkash Singh said ""unconditional"" support to the BJP was meant to convey that ""petty issues"" would not be allowed to cloud the relationship between the two. Udham Singh Nagar issue was important. He said he did not deny that there were other ""equally important"" issues concerning Punjab. ""But then there is always a proper time for an issue to be taken up. The priority at present is Udham Singh Nagar,"" he added.

The PAC held detailed discussions. It had met in an atmosphere of ""shock and sadness"" given the attitude of the BJP though the SAD had repeatedly expressed its opinion and views, including furnishing the opinion of legal and constitutional experts.

The adamant attitude of the BJP has, perhaps, made the SAD take a somewhat tough stand. That it did not outright recall its two Ministers, Mr Surjit Singh Barnala and Mr Sukhbir Singh Badal, from the Union Council of Ministers indicates that the SAD will ""act and react"" logically; not in haste, despite the big challenge it faces to put up a brave face before its own political constituents.

Not only is the SAD determined on its demand but Mr Parkash Singh said even the people of Udham Singh Nagar district had held ‘bandhs’ and ‘dharnas’ and protested being included in the proposed hill state. Nearly 95 per cent village panchayats had passed resolutions to oppose being pushed into Uttaranchal. As many as 275 out of 328 panchayats were opposed to going into Uttaranchal.

The Tribune,1998-08-08 00:00:00,Package for software industry,"The government today announced a banking and foreign exchange package for development of the information technology and software industry and to help strengthen its export potential. Under the package, several changes in the guidelines and procedures relating to provision of bank credit, access to foreign exchange for making certain types of payments and also for equity investments in companies abroad have been announced.

The changes have been made keeping in view the recommendations of the National Task Force for Information Technology and Software Development. Regarding bank credit support, the government said that working capital finance, irrespective of the turnover and business of the borrowers would be provided for the following categories:

Software services, staffing and programming services,
Project services, customised software development and systems solution and integration/maintenance software
Software products and packages and information technology related services.
According to the Finance Ministry, the working capital needs of borrowers would be assessed on the basis of 20 per cent of the projected turnover for those having working capital limits of upto Rs 2 crore. In respect of other borrowers, working capital limits would be decided on the basis of deficits shown in the annual cash budget system. Former category of borrowers has also been allowed to adopt cash budget system, if they so desire.
To facilitate overseas investment, Indian software companies would be granted blanked investment approval upto 50 per cent of their cumulative export/foreign exchange earnings in the preceding three years subject to a maximum of $ 25 million under the Fast Track Route of the RBI. This would provide greater flexibility to Indian software companies in terms of the choice of overseas investments. This ceiling would be inclusive of the $ 15 million under the Export Earned Foreign Currency (EEFC) fast track window and the Fast Track approvals would extend to software companies having cumulative actual export realisation in excess of $ 25 million over the preceding three years. Under the changes, the banks have been advised that equtiy investments in dedicated Venture Capital Funds meant for IT are also eligible for inclusion within the five per cent limit presently prescribed for investments in equity shares including PSU shares, convertible debentures of corporates and in units of Mutual Fund schemes, the corpus of which is not exclusively invested in corporate debt instruments.

Indian software companies have been permitted to offer ADR/GDR linked stock option schemes to their permanent resident/non-resident employees, including Indian and overseas working directors.

The government also announced relaxations in regard to the scheme of overseas investment in joint ventures (jvs) and Wholly Owned Subsidiaries (WOS) abroad under the EEFC Fast Track Window to facilitate investment abroad by Indian corporates:

Under the existing guidelines before approving the proposal, the authorised dealer has to ensure that the applicant has adequate balance in his EEFC account to fully cover the proposed investment as projected in the project/feasibility reports. Henceforth authorised dealers may approve proposals for overseas investment under the EEFC Fast Track Window even in cases where the balance in the EEFC accounts are not sufficient to fully cover the proposed investment at the time of approval, subject to the condition that future accruals in the EEFC account would be utilised to fund the proposed investments within the projected time frame.
As per the existing guidelines, overseas JVs and WOS have to satisfy certain conditions for setting up second and subsequent generation companies. Henceforth, Indian promoters can agree to their JVs and WOS to set up second and subsequent generation companies without fulfilling these conditions provided the first generation company was set up under the EEFC Fast Track Route.
Regarding use of international credit cards (ICCs) for import of software and other related items, the government has allowed authorised dealers in foreign exchange to obtain through internet reimbursement upto $ 15,000 against international credit cards used by software developers and exporters for making advance payment of cost of software.

They have also been allowed to avail through internet payment of fees in respect of training etc. of technical and scientific nature.The dealers have also been authorised to make remittances towards registration of internet domain name, hosting charges for websites etc.

Authorised dealers have also been advised they may arrange to issue ICCs for use of software engineers going abroad on software assignments subject to the condition that reimbursement would be provided out of funds held in software engineers’ bank accounts abroad and not from India.","The government announced a banking and foreign exchange package for the IT and software industry, aligning with recommendations from the National Task Force. Changes include easier access to bank credit for various IT services, blanketed investment approval for overseas ventures, and relaxation in investment guidelines. Indian software companies can offer stock option schemes to employees and invest in joint ventures abroad with flexibility. Further, the use of international credit cards for software imports is streamlined. Authorized dealers can facilitate reimbursements and payments for various IT-related expenses, enhancing ease of transactions for software developers and exporters.",Business and Finance,95,736
The Tribune,1998-08-08 00:00:00,"Teeth to VDCs may boomerang, fears NC govt","Senior Army functionaries in Jammu and Kashmir are said to be unhappy with the authorities, including ministers, ruling National Conference legislators and senior bureaucrats over the way they have been allegedly trying to hamper the functioning of village defence committees. Over 400 such committees have been formed to tackle militancy in Doda, Udhampur and Rajouri districts.

According to a highly placed official source, the state government does not realise the importance of these committees (VDCs) in containing the activities of militants. The Army authorities have explained to the ruling National Conference that militancy can be controlled by VDC members better than the troops as the members are local and well-acquainted with the people and the terrain.

During the past six months the VDC members have repulsed at least 25 attacks by militants on different villages in Doda district. Citing a Defence Ministry, survey the source said the situation in the Kashmir valley could register an improvement only after counter-insurgents or renegade militants carried out operations against the secessionists in the valley between 1994 and 1996.

It was the result of the efforts of the renegade militants that the assembly and Lok Sabha elections could be held in Kashmir in 1996.

However, soon after the National Conference assumed power a large number of renegade militants were killed. Others went into hiding and the remaining rejoined the militant groups. If there is an increase in insurgency in the state, it is because the counter-insurgent groups have lost their teeth.

Senior Army functionaries are worried that VDC members may meet the same fate. ""If this happens, the situation in the three districts of Jammu will be highly volatile when additional companies of security forces have not yet been deployed,"" according to another senior government officer.

Ruling National Conference circles argue that renegade militants indulged in extortion and excesses which led to a public outcry against them.

The National Conference has misgivings over the role of the VDC as a majority of the members belong to one community. This imbalance can be corrected. There are many in the state government who fear bigger trouble in case the VDC members are neither kept under check nor made answerable to a particular agency. There have been reports that some VDC members have acted beyond their brief.

Those who fear that the VDCs may ultimately prove a liability for the state, however, argue in support of the members being recruited either in the police or made part of a regular government-funded militia so that each member is answerable to the government and remain a disciplined lot.

The Army authorities envisage an important role for the VDC members and want the state government to give them better weapons and facilities. Instead of forcing the Army to be deployed for internal security, it will be better if the number of VDCs are increased by at least four times.

In Doda district, senior Army officers have watched with interest the ability of the VDC members to scale the hilly belts with greater speed than the soldiers.
The VDC members have one grievance. They say they are not getting the requisite support from the security forces.

Meanwhile, following a step-up in militant activities and escalation in Pakistani shelling on Indian border villages in West Kashmir and Kargil Sectors, at least 5,000 families from Kargil, Gurez, Karnah, Uri and Tangdhar have migrated to safer places.

The migration from several areas in Doda, Udhampur, Poonch and Rajouri districts in the Jammu region has assumed significant dimensions.

As many as 135 Sikh and Hindu families have migrated since last evening from Ghota and Chassana villages situated on the border of Rajouri and Udhampur districts. Reports said it is panic migration after the people witnessed large groups of armed militants, including foreign mercenaries, moving freely in the hilly belt that connects Poonch and Udhampur.

According to these reports, two buses carrying villagers left yesterday. Another group of migrants was on its way to safer areas in Udhampur.

At least 125 Muslim families have fled from Sailan village near Bafliaz in Poonch where 19 Muslims were killed recently. They are camping in Surankot.
Leaders and workers of the BJP staged a demonstration in Kishtwar, demanding that Doda, Udhampur, Rajouri and Poonch districts be handed over to the Army. Raising slogans against Pakistan and the state administration, the BJP activists called for immediate handing over of these four districts to the Army for eliminating militants.","Senior Army officials in Jammu and Kashmir are displeased with the state government's interference in village defence committees (VDCs), vital in combatting militancy. Over 400 VDCs exist in Doda, Udhampur, and Rajouri districts, repelling 25 militant attacks in six months. The Army stresses the VDCs' effectiveness and demands better support and weaponry. However, the ruling National Conference is wary, citing past abuses by renegade militants. Increased militant activity prompts mass migration from border areas. The BJP urges Army control over districts to tackle militants effectively.",National News,85,738
The Tribune,1998-08-08 00:00:00,HP - JK action plan on steps to fight terrorism,"Both Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh today drew up a joint strategy to fight terrorism and prevent a repeat of the Chamba massacre. For the proposed coordinated action plan, the Centre will provide all necessary tactical and infrastructural support.

Better communication and quick movement of security forces in the event of such an eventuality and making, the so far, inaccessible terrain accessible will also be ensured.

The strategy was discussed between the Chief Ministers of the two states, Mr Farooq Abdullah and Mr Prem Kumar Dhumal, who met at Punjab Raj Bhavan. The Union Home Secretary, Mr B.P. Singh, joined the talks between the two. The Chief Ministers were assisted by their respective officers.

There was no formal briefing for the waiting mediapersons, who sweated it out in the open, Nevertheless, Mr Abdullah said after the talks that any attack anywhere on innocent people was, in fact, an ""attack on the nation and its integrity"". In Pakistan, he said, it were not the politicians but the soldiers who called the shots.

Mr Abdullah said when he recently met some US Senators he pointed to them how day in and day out innocent people, men, women and children, were being killed by mercenaries from across the border. ""Pakistan is under the thumb of the USA , its protege. If the Clinton Administration raises its little finger all terrorism being perpetrated in Kashmir and elsewhere in India can be stopped"", he told the senators.

Both states have a 160-km-long border in Chamba, Doda and Kathua area. At today's meeting besides state-level coordination emphasis was on ""floor coordination"" at the district-level in terms of policing and exchange of intelligence information. Micro-level details would be worked out while the broad strategy had been agreed upon with the Centre assuring more paramilitary forces and help by way of communication, mobility and other support.

""Pakistan will never succeed in its nefarious designs"", said Mr Abdullah. Pakistan should understand the difficulty with which the people and their emotions were being kept under control by India. ""If the situation so warranted we can also cross the line.""

Only ""soft"" targets were being picked up for gunning down, as in the case of Chamba, where the terrain was difficult.

The Himachal Chief Minister, Mr Dhumal, did not say much except that more road network infrastructure was needed to be built. ""No comments"" was his crisp reply when asked if the Chamba killings were due to laxity on the part of the police and intelligence agencies despite the fact there were reports of such an incident taking place. ""We have asked for more security forces"", he added.

The Union Home Secretary, Mr B.P. Singh, said he was here to discuss the requirements of the two states and the Centre would do everything possible to contain terrorism. At this Mr Abdullah remarked: ""Pakistan will never succeed in its aim. J&K will remain an integral part of India. We are keeping peoples' emotions under control and God willing will not be forced into circumstances to cross the border.""

When some reporters referred to the ""failure"" of talks between the two Prime Ministers at Colombo and the continuing ""stalemate"" in resuming dialogue at the Foreign Secretary level and that only talks could end terrorism, Mr Abdullah said: ""You are mistaken. The talks did not fail.""

Among those present at the meeting were J&K's Chief Secretary, Mr Ashok Jaitely, and the Director-General of Police, Mr Gurbachan Jagat. From the CRPF Inspector-General, Mr A.S. Gill, was present from Himachal Pradesh were the Chief Secretary, Mr O.P. Yadav, the Home Secretary, Mrs Asha Swaroop, and the Director-General of Police, Mr B.S. Thakur.","The Chief Ministers of Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh, along with Union Home Secretary B.P. Singh, devised a joint strategy to combat terrorism, especially in areas like Chamba. They focused on enhancing communication, mobility of security forces, and coordination at both state and district levels. The Centre pledged support for infrastructure and paramilitary forces. Mr. Farooq Abdullah emphasized the need to counter Pakistan-backed terrorism, while Mr. Dhumal stressed the importance of road network development. Both CMs remained committed to curbing terrorism, rejecting talks with Pakistan until terrorism ceases. The meeting addressed security concerns and highlighted India's resolve against terrorism.",National News,100,607
The Tribune,1998-08-08 00:00:00,Riparian states reach accord on Cauvery water-sharing dispute,"A breakthrough was achieved today on the implementation of the contentious interim award of Cauvery water-sharing dispute, with the Chief Ministers of four basin states arriving at a ""broad agreement"".

After three rounds of talks spread over two days, the Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and Pondicherry had with the Prime Minister, Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee, an agreement was reached ahead of the August 12 deadline set by the Supreme Court for finalising a scheme to implement the interim award of the tribunal. The four-point agreement announced officially, envisages a scheme for giving effect to the interim award of the Cauvery Water Dispute Tribunal and all related subsequent orders.

Under it there shall be an authority which will comprise the Prime Minister and the Chief Ministers of the four states concerned. The authority shall frame rules and regulations for the conduct of its business and under it there shall be a monitoring committee consisting of designated officers of the Central Government and the state governments concerned.

The Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, Mr M. Karunanidhi and Mr J.H. Patel, respectively, expressed happiness at the agreement.

However, there was no unanimity about the nature, role and functions of the monitoring committee with Karnataka stating that the Committee should only assist the authority. Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry did not accept this position while Kerala reserved its views on the issue, it was officially stated.
To resolve the differences among the states, it was decided to constitute a drafting committee which will look into the powers, duties, functions and role of the monitoring committee.

The drafting committee will function under the chairmanship of the Union Cabinet Secretary and will include the designated officers of the state governments concerned. The first meeting of the committee is scheduled to be held shortly.

The Tamil Nadu Chief Minister, Mr Karunanidhi thanked the Prime Minister and the Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission, Mr Jaswant Singh for their efforts to help reach an agreement.

Mr Karunanidhi said he was happy that the 1991 Interim award directing Karnataka to release 205 TMC feet of water to Tamil Nadu would now be implemented under an amicable agreement.

The Karnataka Chief Minister, Mr J.H. Patel when asked if he was happy at the outcome, said any agreement was good in the interest of the nation or the state.

He said Karnataka requested the Prime Minister that the Supreme Court should be requested to direct the tribunal to give its final award at the earliest.

The Kerala Chief Minister, Mr E.K. Naynar, said the agreement would solve 80 per cent of the dispute over sharing of the Cauvery waters.

Opening the meeting yesterday, Mr Vajpayee had called for evolving a national water policy for optimum utilisation of the country’s water resources and hoped to bring forward a draft policy and guidelines for discussion with the states.

The BJP today expressed happiness at the breakthrough on the Cauvery water sharing dispute with the Chief Ministers of the four basin states reaching a ""broad agreement"" on implementation of the interim order of the tribunal and creation of a river valley authority with Prime Minister as its head ending a seven-year long tussle.

""We are happy that under Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee’s leadership, a breakthrough has been achieved on the Cauvery water dispute and we hope that before August 12 deadline of the Supreme Court, all four states (Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Pondicherry and Kerala) would come to an understanding keeping in view local and national interests"", party general secretary Venkaiah Naidu told newsmen here.

The accord was reached after nine hours discussions spread over two days between the Prime Minister and the Chief Ministers concerned for finalising a scheme to implement the award.

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi said that he had taken into confidence all political parties in the state while agreeing for a resolution of the Cauvery water dispute issue.

Asked whether today’s agreement had the support of AIADMK leader Jayalalitha, Mr Karunanidhi said ""I do not know her personal views on the matter but I tried to accommodate the views of all political parties"".
To a question whether the agreement had been reached only to placate the BJP’s ally, AIADMK, and not because of his effort, the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister shot back ""this may be your opinion"".

Addressing a press conference on the agreement, Mr Karunanidhi said it was a victory for the people of both Karnataka and Tamil Nadu and there was no war between the two states.

The DMK chief claimed that it was as a result of his persistent efforts as Chief Minister during the prime ministerial tenures of V.P. Singh, I.K. Gujral and Atal Behari Vajpayee that the scheme for implementation of the interim award had been conceived, framed and now being implemented.

(The agreement reached today assumes significance in the wake of Supreme Court's order last month directing the Centre to finalise the scheme before August 12 and report to the court. The court had also made it clear that it would not brook any further delay. The Centre had sought as many as nine adjournments in connection with this case during the last one year.)

During their interaction with newspersons after the meeting, both Mr Karunanidhi and Mr Patel skirted contentious issues like penal provisions in the original draft scheme including the possible takeover of reservoirs in Karnataka by the Centre if it failed to release water.

Briefing newspersons after the meeting Mr Patel said that Karnataka had said in clear terms that the monitoring committee could not function as a parallel authority and shall work under the Cauvery Basin Authority (CBA) which will be headed by the Prime Minister with the four chief ministers as its members.

The monitoring authority’s role shall be to assist and advise the CBA and collect facts for it, he said.

However, the monitoring authority shall not have independent powers to inspect the dams but would only provide facts to enable the CBA to evolve and take decisions, Mr Patel added.

He said that the state had stated that the decision of the authority shall be governed by consensus .

The Chief Minister said that the state had also agreed to the setting up of a drafting committee headed by Cabinet Secretary which will be assisted by Chief Secretaries of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Pondicherry. This in effect would mean that the drafting would start afresh. There was no time limit fixed for this, he said.","After two days of talks, the Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala, and Pondicherry, along with Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, achieved a broad agreement on the Cauvery water-sharing dispute.

The monitoring authority’s role shall be to assist and advise the CBA and collect facts for it, he said.

However, the monitoring authority shall not have independent powers to inspect the dams but would only provide facts to enable the CBA to evolve and take decisions, Mr Patel added.

He said that the state had stated that the decision of the authority shall be governed by consensus .

The Chief Minister said that the state had also agreed to the setting up of a drafting committee headed by Cabinet Secretary which will be assisted by Chief Secretaries of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Pondicherry. This in effect would mean that the drafting would start afresh. There was no time limit fixed for this, he said.","A breakthrough was achieved in the Cauvery water-sharing dispute as Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala, and Pondicherry reached a broad agreement on the implementation of the interim award. The agreement, reached ahead of the Supreme Court's August 12 deadline, involves the creation of an authority comprising the Prime Minister and Chief Ministers to frame rules for the interim award. However, there was no unanimity on the nature and role of the monitoring committee, leading to the formation of a drafting committee to address differences. The BJP expressed satisfaction with the resolution.",Local News,93,1085
The Tribune,1998-08-09 00:00:00,"Jaya, allies turn down Cauvery accord","A day after the Centre announced a breakthrough in the Cauvery dispute, hopes for an amicable settlement received a jolt, with AIADMK supremo Jayalalitha, the defiant partner in the BJP-led coalition, and three of her allies rejecting outright the agreement among the four states.

In a joint statement here, Jayalalitha, and leaders of the MDMK, the PMK and the Janata Party opposed the accord and instead demanded that a 1997 draft scheme prepared by the Gujral government be notified forthwith in the official gazette, and the Supreme Court apprised of it on August 12.

Striking a discordant note amidst all-round euphoria, the AIADMK front condemned Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi for accepting an uncertain mechanism for the implementation of the Cauvery tribunal’s interim award.

The signatories — Jayalalitha, MDMK general secretary Vaiko, PMK founder S. Ramadoss and JP president Subramanian Swamy — said the envisaged Cauvery river valley authority was only a political body with no clear-cut powers, while the monitoring committee would be a toothless panel.

They said their fears that Mr Karunanidhi’s participation in the Chief Ministers’ meeting in New Delhi on August 6 would jeopardise Tamil Nadu’s interests had come true, as he had now given the Centre an excuse to seek yet another adjournment in the apex court in the guise of taking more time to define the monitoring committee’s powers.

Ms Jayalalitha and others said the earlier draft scheme, envisaging a statutory authority to implement the tribunal’s interim award of 205 TMC ft of water to Tamil Nadu, was an ideal scheme, but it had been totally forgotten, and a new powerless authority was being sought to be created.

The AIADMK front condemned Mr Karunanidhi for ‘scuttling’ a solution to the dispute at an opportune time by settling for a far less satisfactory arrangement, which did not guarantee Karnataka’s acceptance and implementation of the final award.

Citing the differences between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu on the monitoring panel’s powers, they wondered how the ""broad agreement"" could be adhered to when the parties did not even concur on the constitution of the committee.

On the authority’s composition, they said the five-member body did not have the power to decide matters on majority, and even one member’s dissent could stultify its functioning.

The leaders recalled that at the all-party meeting called by Mr Karunanidhi on August 3, the AIADMK and allies had opposed his attending the New Delhi meeting, as it was an obvious ruse to delay matters. He had gone to the capital ignoring their opinion, after claiming unanimity on his participation.

Even in New Delhi, he had taken ""unilateral"" decisions to accept a diluted scheme, while his Karnataka counterpart J.H. Patel had consulted his party members twice in New Delhi itself, they said.

President of the Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC), G.K. Moopanar, today expressed his appreciation for the breakthrough achieved in New Delhi yesterday on the thorny Cauvery waters dispute.

""We feel that both Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have won a prize from mother India celebrating golden jubilee of her independence this year"", he said in a statement here.

He described as an ""important milestone"" the agreement reached between the two main contending states on ""some basic issues"", despite their ""political compulsions"" in the past which prevented a solution to the vexed issue. The spirit of ""give and take"" adopted by both Karnataka and Tamil Nadu deserved all appreciation, he said adding that yesterday’s agreement was only a ""beginning"" in the attempts to find a permanent solution to the problem, keeping the interests of the farmers in mind.

In another statement, general secretary of the MGR Anna DMK S. Thirunavukkarasu, welcomed the agreement and urged the Chief Minister to convene an all-party meeting to explain the decisions taken at the Delhi’s conference.

President of the Tamil Nadu RJD, K. Jagaveerapandiyan, in his statement, condemned the agreement saying the Chief Minister had failed to protect the state’s interests at the expense of getting some ""political gains"".

UNI: The All-India Anna DMK (AIADMK)-led front today rejected outright the Cauvery accord reached at the meeting of Chief Ministers of four riparian states in New Delhi yesterday.

The three-hour meeting, held at the residence of AIADMK supremo J. Jayalalitha, and attended by PMK founder leader Dr S. Ramadoss, MDMK general secretary Vaiko, MP, Janata Party president Subramanian Swamy, Union Law Minister M. Thambidurai and AIADMK chairman V.R. Nedunchezhiyan, rejected the accord as ""unacceptable"" as it was against Tamil Nadu’s interests.

Tamizhaga Rajiv Congress president and Union Petroleum Minister Vazhapadi K. Ramamurthy, who was away in Salem, did not attend the meeting although an invitation was extended to him.

Emerging from the meeting, Dr Ramadoss, Mr Vaiko and Mr Thambidurai said the accord was against Tamil Nadu’s interests and was therefore rejected.

A detailed joint statement released after the meeting and signed by the front partners gave a point by point account as to why the accord was unacceptable to the front.

NEW DELHI: Meanwhile the final hurdle in the way of clinching an accord on the Cauvery issue was overcome today with the major parties to the dispute, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, reaching an agreement on the role and functions of the monitoring committee.

Thus, the decks have been cleared for the implementation of the seven-year-old interim award of the Cauvery water tribunal.

The Chief Ministers of the four riparian states — Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and Pondicherry — had come to a broad agreement on all contentious issues barring the role and functions of the monitoring committee at a high level meeting convened by Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee yesterday.

Karnataka Irrigation Minister K.N. Nage Gowda told newspersons today that his state had accepted the formula suggested by the drafting committee. He expressed the hope that other states would follow suit since the accord was in the interest of farmers of all the riparian states.

Sources in Tamil Nadu government told UNI that they have also cleared the formula of the drafting committee.

According to the formula, the monitoring committee would render assistance to the authority to enable them to take decisions on issues under consideration.

The committee will assist in the collection of information and data and in monitoring the implementation of the decisions of the authority. In case any difficulty arose in implementation, the monitoring committee would report the position to the authority.

It will also assist the authority in setting up a well-designed hydro meteorological network in the Cauvery basin along with a modern communication system for transmission of data and a computer-based control room for data processing to determine the hydrological conditions of the basin.
Mr Nage Gowda said the agreement reached was a vindication of Karnataka’s stand that the dispute could be resolved only through negotiations.

Mr Nage Gowda said there would not be any problem with Tamil Nadu in a normal year and that the Prime Minister’s intervention may not be needed. All these elaborate arrangements are only meant for dealing with the situation during adverse natural conditions.

Meanwhile, an official committee headed by Cabinet Secretary Prabhat Kumar burnt midnight oil to finalise a scheme on the duties and functions of the monitoring committee on the implementation of the interim award.

Tamil Nadu and Karnataka are understood to have approved four proposals on the role of the monitoring committee which would only assist the authority and not have any independent executive or statutory powers.

The Chief Secretaries of four states, who approved the drafting committee’s proposals, decided that the committee would function under the authority.

A final decision on the monitoring committee’s role would be taken at the next meeting of the drafting committee on August 10 after which a notification on implementing the interim award would be published and the Supreme Court informed.

Mr Karunanidhi, who reached Chennai today, told reporters that the proposed authority would only implement the interim award of the Cauvery tribunal and not be a mechanism to enforce the final award.

His Karnataka counterpart J.H. Patel said in Bangalore that the monitoring committee would not have an statutory powers.

The four broad proposals of the draft on the role of the monitoring committee are:
1. The role of the monitoring committee will be to render assistance to the authority to enable them take decisions.
2. The committee shall assist the authority in collecting information and data.
3. The committee shall assist the authority in monitoring the implementation of the decisions of the authority and in case of any difficulty arising in implementation the committee shall report the position to the authority.
4. The monitoring committee shall assist the authority in setting up a well-designed hydro-meteorological network in the Cauvery basin along with a modern communication system for transmission of data and a computer-based control room for data processing to determine the hydrological condition.back


 	
Subtle moves to oust Sonia
From K.V. Prasad
Tribune News Service

NEW DELHI, Aug 8 — Subtle moves have been initiated by the Central Government to re-alter the current structure and control of the prestigious Indira Gandhi National Centre for Arts (IGNCA) which could well result in removal of the Congress President, Mrs Sonia Gandhi, as its life-trustee.

Founded in 1987, the IGNCA is one of the wealthiest cultural trusts in the country with a corpus of over Rs 50 crore and vast land spreading over nearly 23 acres in New Delhi’s prime area — parallel to Rajpath.

Mrs Sonia Gandhi was made a life-trustee of the IGNCA, through an amendment carried out in the original trust deed in 1995 during the time of P V Narasimha Rao Government and five prominent people were appointed trustees for life.

They included former President, R. Venkataraman, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, former Information Adviser to the Prime Minister, H.Y. Sharda Prasad, Dr Kapila Vatsyayan and late Pupul Jayakar.

The move began with the current government referring the amendment to the original trust deed carried out by then Human Resource Development Minister, Mr Madhav Rao Scindia, to the Attorney General for his comments. As per the deed the President whose term was originally for 10 years, was made President for life.

The Union Minister for Human Resource Development is an ex-officio member of the Trust.

By questioning the validity of the amendment in the eyes of law, the government has opened a channel that could result in ending the tenure of the current trustees who have either been Congress members or have been known to be close to the Nehru-Gandhi family, sources said.

Political circles see the move as yet another attempt by the BJP-led government to reconstitute important institutions of learning, arts and culture, after having stirred a controversy over the recent reconstitution of the Indian Council for Historical Research.

Apart from a substantial corpus, which earns interest, the IGNCA has a grant of nearly Rs 150 crore as building fund which can be drawn as per progress, the source said.

However, official sources state that as per the original deed there were no life trustees. The first appointment of all the trustees was to be made by the government. The government had also a role in the appointment of new trustees against the vacancies arising from the retirement of trustees. The amendment converted the tenure of the founder trustees for life with the government having no role in their appointment.

They say the original deed provided that the President of India shall be the visitor of the IGNCA and may set up a committee to review the working of the Centre from time to time. The recommendations of the committee as accepted by the Government in consultation with the Trust will be binding on it. This provision was also said to be deleted in the amendment.

The amendments were said to be carried out by the then Minister through an order whereas the original deed is said to provide for amendments, alterations or modifications to come into effect only after prior approval of the Government of India. The amended trust deed, it was said, has no stipulation.

The sources also said that as per available records there is little to indicate that the Law Ministry was consulted prior to approval to the amendments","Hopes for a Cauvery dispute settlement were dashed as AIADMK's Jayalalitha and allies rejected the agreement among riparian states, opposing the proposed monitoring committee's toothless role. They demanded notification of a 1997 draft scheme. Tamil Nadu RJD criticized CM Karunanidhi for accepting a diluted arrangement. However, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu reached an agreement on the monitoring committee's functions, clearing the way for implementing the Cauvery tribunal's interim award. The move to potentially oust Sonia Gandhi as a life-trustee of IGNCA emerged, with the government questioning amendments made during PV Narasimha Rao's tenure, signaling a shift in cultural institution leadership.",Local News,99,2025
the tribune,1998-08-09 00:00:00,Uttarakhand: Roorkee faces uncertain future,"This town which boasts of one of the oldest technical universities, is agog with political activity these days because of its uncertain future due to the proposed merger of Hardwar district in the newly proposed Uttarakhand state.

The announcement of the central government to include Hardwar in Uttarakhand took most of the people here by surprise. While most politicians, except those of the BJP, are opposed to the move, the business community is divided.

The state president of the Samajwadi Party, Mr Ram Sharan Dass, who hails from the nearby Saharanpur town has accused the BJP of “ playing with the sentiments of the people of this area”. Mr Dass maintained that the issue of the inclusion of Hardwar had been purposely raised by the BJP in order to delay the creation of Uttarakhand.

He announced here today that the SP would decide its course of action after the Lok Tantrik Morcha’s August 9 rally in Lucknow. He said even the residents of Vikas Nagar tehsil of Dehra Dun district did not want their area to be merged in the Uttarakhand .

Mr Harpal Sathi, BJP MP from the Hardwar (reserve) parliamentary seat, on the other hand, observed that the final decision regarding the inclusion of Hardwar would be taken after considering the sentiments of the people.

The opposition of the Lok Tantrik Congress and the Jan Tantrik Bahujan Samaj party to the move and withdrawal of support from the BJP-led government have further provided a fillip to the proposal. The Jan Tantrik Bahujan Samaj party at a meeting in Mohalla Sati, here, resolved today to oppose the proposal tooth and nail. Workers of the Lok Tantrik Congress are already up in arms because its state president, Mr Naresh Aggarwal, who is also a minister in the Kalyan Singh government has opposed the move in writing.

Many residents feel that they have little cultural and social affinity with the hill people. Just because the government is keen on keeping the Kumbh area intact, Hardwar was being transferred to Uttarakhand, they add."," It discusses the political turmoil and uncertainty in a town due to the proposed merger of Hardwar district in the newly proposed Uttarakhand state. The announcement by the central government regarding this merger has sparked various reactions among politicians and the business community. Opposition parties like the Samajwadi Party, Lok Tantrik Congress, and Jan Tantrik Bahujan Samaj party are against the move, accusing the BJP of playing with people's sentiments. Meanwhile, BJP leaders emphasize considering the sentiments of the people before making a final decision. The text also highlights the cultural and social differences between the town and the hill areas, which some residents believe are overlooked in the government's decision-making process.",Local News,112,341

Founded in 1987, the IGNCA is one of the wealthiest cultural trusts in the country with a corpus of over Rs 50 crore and vast land spreading over nearly 23 acres in New Delhi’s prime area — parallel to Rajpath.

The recommendations of the committee as accepted by the Government in consultation with the Trust will be binding on it. This provision was also said to be deleted in the amendment.

The amendments were said to be carried out by the then Minister through an order whereas the original deed is said to provide for amendments, alterations or modifications to come into effect only after prior approval of the Government of India. The amended trust deed, it was said, has no stipulation.

The sources also said that as per available records there is little to indicate that the Law Ministry was consulted prior to approval to the amendments","The Central Government is considering altering the structure of the prestigious Indira Gandhi National Centre for Arts (IGNCA), possibly leading to the removal of Congress President Sonia Gandhi as its life-trustee. Initiated by questioning an amendment to the original trust deed, the move aims to replace trustees associated with the Nehru-Gandhi family. It reflects a broader trend of reconstituting cultural and educational institutions by the BJP-led government. IGNCA, with significant assets and grants, faces potential restructuring amid controversy over procedural irregularities in the amendment process, including lack of consultation with the Law Ministry.",Politics,93,545
The Tribune,1998-08-09 00:00:00,"Jaya, allies turn down Cauvery accord","A day after the Centre announced a breakthrough in the Cauvery dispute, hopes for an amicable settlement received a jolt, with AIADMK supremo Jayalalitha, the defiant partner in the BJP-led coalition, and three of her allies rejecting outright the agreement among the four states.

In a joint statement here, Jayalalitha, and leaders of the MDMK, the PMK and the Janata Party opposed the accord and instead demanded that a 1997 draft scheme prepared by the Gujral government be notified forthwith in the official gazette, and the Supreme Court apprised of it on August 12.

Striking a discordant note amidst all-round euphoria, the AIADMK front condemned Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi for accepting an uncertain mechanism for the implementation of the Cauvery tribunal’s interim award.

The signatories — Jayalalitha, MDMK general secretary Vaiko, PMK founder S. Ramadoss and JP president Subramanian Swamy — said the envisaged Cauvery river valley authority was only a political body with no clear-cut powers, while the monitoring committee would be a toothless panel.

They said their fears that Mr Karunanidhi’s participation in the Chief Ministers’ meeting in New Delhi on August 6 would jeopardise Tamil Nadu’s interests had come true, as he had now given the Centre an excuse to seek yet another adjournment in the apex court in the guise of taking more time to define the monitoring committee’s powers.

Ms Jayalalitha and others said the earlier draft scheme, envisaging a statutory authority to implement the tribunal’s interim award of 205 TMC ft of water to Tamil Nadu, was an ideal scheme, but it had been totally forgotten, and a new powerless authority was being sought to be created.

The AIADMK front condemned Mr Karunanidhi for ‘scuttling’ a solution to the dispute at an opportune time by settling for a far less satisfactory arrangement, which did not guarantee Karnataka’s acceptance and implementation of the final award.

Citing the differences between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu on the monitoring panel’s powers, they wondered how the ""broad agreement"" could be adhered to when the parties did not even concur on the constitution of the committee.

On the authority’s composition, they said the five-member body did not have the power to decide matters on majority, and even one member’s dissent could stultify its functioning.

The leaders recalled that at the all-party meeting called by Mr Karunanidhi on August 3, the AIADMK and allies had opposed his attending the New Delhi meeting, as it was an obvious ruse to delay matters. He had gone to the capital ignoring their opinion, after claiming unanimity on his participation.

Even in New Delhi, he had taken ""unilateral"" decisions to accept a diluted scheme, while his Karnataka counterpart J.H. Patel had consulted his party members twice in New Delhi itself, they said.

President of the Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC), G.K. Moopanar, today expressed his appreciation for the breakthrough achieved in New Delhi yesterday on the thorny Cauvery waters dispute.

""We feel that both Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have won a prize from mother India celebrating golden jubilee of her independence this year"", he said in a statement here.

He described as an ""important milestone"" the agreement reached between the two main contending states on ""some basic issues"", despite their ""political compulsions"" in the past which prevented a solution to the vexed issue. The spirit of ""give and take"" adopted by both Karnataka and Tamil Nadu deserved all appreciation, he said adding that yesterday’s agreement was only a ""beginning"" in the attempts to find a permanent solution to the problem, keeping the interests of the farmers in mind.

In another statement, general secretary of the MGR Anna DMK S. Thirunavukkarasu, welcomed the agreement and urged the Chief Minister to convene an all-party meeting to explain the decisions taken at the Delhi’s conference.

Tamizhaga Rajiv Congress president and Union Petroleum Minister Vazhapadi K. Ramamurthy, who was away in Salem, did not attend the meeting although an invitation was extended to him.

Emerging from the meeting, Dr Ramadoss, Mr Vaiko and Mr Thambidurai said the accord was against Tamil Nadu’s interests and was therefore rejected.

A detailed joint statement released after the meeting and signed by the front partners gave a point by point account as to why the accord was unacceptable to the front.

NEW DELHI: Meanwhile the final hurdle in the way of clinching an accord on the Cauvery issue was overcome today with the major parties to the dispute, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, reaching an agreement on the role and functions of the monitoring committee.

Thus, the decks have been cleared for the implementation of the seven-year-old interim award of the Cauvery water tribunal.

The Chief Ministers of the four riparian states — Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and Pondicherry — had come to a broad agreement on all contentious issues barring the role and functions of the monitoring committee at a high level meeting convened by Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee yesterday.

Karnataka Irrigation Minister K.N. Nage Gowda told newspersons today that his state had accepted the formula suggested by the drafting committee. He expressed the hope that other states would follow suit since the accord was in the interest of farmers of all the riparian states.

Sources in Tamil Nadu government told UNI that they have also cleared the formula of the drafting committee.

According to the formula, the monitoring committee would render assistance to the authority to enable them to take decisions on issues under consideration.

The committee will assist in the collection of information and data and in monitoring the implementation of the decisions of the authority. In case any difficulty arose in implementation, the monitoring committee would report the position to the authority.

It will also assist the authority in setting up a well-designed hydro meteorological network in the Cauvery basin along with a modern communication system for transmission of data and a computer-based control room for data processing to determine the hydrological conditions of the basin.
Mr Nage Gowda said the agreement reached was a vindication of Karnataka’s stand that the dispute could be resolved only through negotiations.

Mr Nage Gowda said there would not be any problem with Tamil Nadu in a normal year and that the Prime Minister’s intervention may not be needed. All these elaborate arrangements are only meant for dealing with the situation during adverse natural conditions.

Meanwhile, an official committee headed by Cabinet Secretary Prabhat Kumar burnt midnight oil to finalise a scheme on the duties and functions of the monitoring committee on the implementation of the interim award.

Tamil Nadu and Karnataka are understood to have approved four proposals on the role of the monitoring committee which would only assist the authority and not have any independent executive or statutory powers.

The Chief Secretaries of four states, who approved the drafting committee’s proposals, decided that the committee would function under the authority.

A final decision on the monitoring committee’s role would be taken at the next meeting of the drafting committee on August 10 after which a notification on implementing the interim award would be published and the Supreme Court informed.

Mr Karunanidhi, who reached Chennai today, told reporters that the proposed authority would only implement the interim award of the Cauvery tribunal and not be a mechanism to enforce the final award.

The committee will assist the authority and report any implementation issues. Karnataka's Irrigation Minister expressed hope for other states' cooperation.

The Tribune,1998-08-10 00:00:00,PoK areas to be reclaimed: Fernandes Rules out LoC conversion,"Defence Minister George Fernandes has said that the areas of Jammu and Kashmir under Pakistani occupation have to be reclaimed and ruled out the conversion of the Line of Control (LoC) into international border.

“...There is a part of Jammu and Kashmir which is occupied by Pakistan, and that part has to be reclaimed”, Mr Fernandes told Eenadu TV in an interview.

Asked whether the Line of Control should be converted into an international border between India and Pakistan taking into account the ground realities, he said “that is not the position of the government and I don’t think that will be the position of the government (in future also)”.

According to the transcript of the interview, he said: “There is some part of Jammu and Kashmir which is lying with China. That is also a factor which can’t be lightly dismissed. That is the ground reality. Now if one talks, discusses and debates, what emerges out of that is too premature at the moment to guess even”.

On the recent massacres in Doda and Prankote in Jammu and Kashmir, the Defence Minister said “there seems to be a sinister design on the part of our neighbour, who has been sending mercenaries into this region of Kashmir and the effort seems to be to create a Hindu-Muslim confrontation in the Doda region. Fortunately, so far they have not been successful”

.“The government has planned special measures and is in the process of implementing these”, he said.

Spelling out these measures, Mr Fernandes said: “It is a question of inducting more forces, using local intelligence for the purpose of the identification of mercenaries and also having a very swift-moving striking force which can act with great speed in areas where the movements of mercenaries are noticed. We expect better results in the coming days”.

On the continuous heavy artillery firing by Pakistan along LoC, he said “Pakistan is orchestrating incidents on the border to create a sense of alarm and project Jammu and Kashmir as a flashpoint. Pakistan’s desperation is becoming acute in view of the fast-declining support in the valley to militancy”.

On the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), he said: “the discriminatory part is that it says that those of us who have (nuclear bomb) will have, and those of you who don’t have, will never have. Now we have said that we have”.

Asked what India expected from the USA in return for signing CTBT, he said: “There is no give and take involved. What is involved is the acceptance and realisation that India is a nuclear weapon state, in the same way as the USA, China, Russia or other nuclear weapon states only the right to go about their business. So do we have the right to go about our business”.

In an interview to Star TV tonight, he said nuclear deterrent did not have any place in resolving the situation along the LoC in Kashmir and India’s efforts were to bring Pakistan to the negotiating table on all bilateral issues.
If at all there is any conflict on Kashmir it would be a conventional one to be ""tackled in a way it is tackled"", he said.

However, it was ""premature"" to make any observation on the situation in the border, he said adding that the Prime Ministers of both countries were scheduled to hold discussions in Durban (South Africa) later this month. He hoped that talks between the two countries would continue.","
Defence Minister George Fernandes stated that the areas of Jammu and Kashmir under Pakistani occupation must be reclaimed and ruled out converting the Line of Control (LoC) into an international border. He highlighted the sinister design of Pakistan in sending mercenaries to create Hindu-Muslim confrontation in Doda. Fernandes outlined measures, including deploying more forces and utilizing local intelligence, to address the situation. He attributed Pakistan's heavy artillery firing along the LoC to desperation amid declining support for militancy in the valley. Regarding the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), Fernandes emphasized India's right as a nuclear weapon state and rejected any give-and-take expectations from the USA. He asserted that nuclear deterrents wouldn't resolve the Kashmir situation, and India aimed to bring Pakistan to the negotiating table.",International News,125,576
The Tribune,1998-08-10 00:00:00,Govt not to give in;' new scheme ready,"A statement from a senior BJP leader from Karnataka calling the AIADMK supremo, Ms J. Jayalalitha an ""extra-constitutional authority"" today caught the party Central leadership unawares as it was making a conscious effort to downplay her latest threat of review of support to the Vajpayee government.

While the BJP vice-president, Mr K.L. Sharma, stressed that there was no threat to the BJP-led coalition government at the Centre as the Prime Minister, Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee, would get the problem resolved, a senior leader from Karnataka, Mr H.N. Nanjegowda, said the central government would not be pressurised by the ""extra-constitutional authority"" of Ms Jayalalitha on the Cauvery issue.

Responding to newspersons' questions on Ms Jayalalitha’s ultimatum of reviewing her party’s support to the government, Mr Sharma expressed confidence that the Prime Minister would get the problem resolved through talks. Mr Vajpayee would hoist the National Flag at the historic Red Fort on August 15, Mr Sharma said in reply to a question.

The Vajpayee government was being run on consensus and decisions taken after consulting allies, the BJP leader said. ""We take our allies' concerns,views and suggestions seriously"", Mr Sharma said, adding ""We are confident that the Prime Minister would sort out all their problems"".

Earlier, Mr Nanjegowda said, ""Enough is enough. How long can we suffer this attitude? She is a nobody. She is only trying to make political gains. I am confident the government will not submit itself to such extra-constitutional authority on the Cauvery agreement.""

""Our government will not tolerate the blackmail tactics of anybody or the intervention of any exta-constitutional authority"", Mr Nanjegowda, who was one of the key advisers to the Centre on resolving the impasse regarding implementation of interim reward of the Cauvery tribunal, said. Mr Nanjegowda is a former Irrigation Minister of Karnataka.

Mr Nanjegowda further made an appeal to the people of all the basin states that they should not get carried away by vested political interests regarding the settlement of water sharing. He said that this was the right time to create a harmonious atmosphere so that the issue could be sorted outside the courts and in an amicable way.

The party’s central leadership, which had specifically instructed its state units and state leaders that they should exercise restraint on their expressions on allies, is declining to comment on Mr Nanjegowda’s statement today.

Mr Sharma, who acted today as the BJP’s official spokesman, evaded or circumvented newspersons' pointed and sharp questions on Ms Jayalalitha’s threat.

To a question on the subject, Mr Sharma quipped that there were threats from the AIADMK, Shiromani Akali Dal,Trinamool Congress and the Samata Party but ""no party has withdrawn support"". Mr Sharma also tried to deflect the issue by launching an attack on the Congress President, Mrs Sonia Gandhi. He said that she should concentrate on mending her own house first before trying to topple the government.

In an indirect reference to Mrs Gandhi, Mr Sharma said that ever since the leadership of the Congress has been passed into ""inexperienced hands"", it is ""hurting the Congress and the country"".

On the earlier threats from these parties, the BJP’s usual refrain during the past two months has been that ""we don’t join issue with our allies publicly"".

Mr Nanjegowda’s tough posture on Ms Jayalalitha ""cannot be and should not be seen in isolation"", a BJP leader said on conditions of anonymity. ""This is power politics and in this power game, such posturing is often done to achieve some objectives"", he said adding, ""After all, Ms Jayalalitha has also taken her stand keeping her political constituency in view""","
A senior BJP leader from Karnataka labeled AIADMK leader J. Jayalalitha as an ""extra-constitutional authority,"" surprising the central leadership that was attempting to downplay her threat of reviewing support to the Vajpayee government. BJP vice-president K.L. Sharma asserted no threat to the government, expressing confidence that Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee would resolve the issue. However, Karnataka leader H.N. Nanjegowda dismissed Jayalalitha as a ""nobody"" and emphasized that the government wouldn't yield to her ""extra-constitutional authority"" on the Cauvery issue. He urged basin states' people not to be swayed by political interests. The central leadership, cautious about public comments on allies, refrained from addressing Nanjegowda's statement, deflecting attention by mentioning threats from other parties. A BJP leader suggested Nanjegowda's stance was a strategic political move in power politics.",Politics,128,599
The Tribune,1998-08-10 00:00:00,PoK areas to be reclaimed: Fernandes Rules out LoC conversion,"Defence Minister George Fernandes has said that the areas of Jammu and Kashmir under Pakistani occupation have to be reclaimed and ruled out the conversion of the Line of Control (LoC) into international border.

“...There is a part of Jammu and Kashmir which is occupied by Pakistan, and that part has to be reclaimed”, Mr Fernandes told Eenadu TV in an interview.

Asked whether the Line of Control should be converted into an international border between India and Pakistan taking into account the ground realities, he said “that is not the position of the government and I don’t think that will be the position of the government (in future also)”.

According to the transcript of the interview, he said: “There is some part of Jammu and Kashmir which is lying with China. That is also a factor which can’t be lightly dismissed. That is the ground reality. Now if one talks, discusses and debates, what emerges out of that is too premature at the moment to guess even”.

On the recent massacres in Doda and Prankote in Jammu and Kashmir, the Defence Minister said “there seems to be a sinister design on the part of our neighbour, who has been sending mercenaries into this region of Kashmir and the effort seems to be to create a Hindu-Muslim confrontation in the Doda region. Fortunately, so far they have not been successful”

.“The government has planned special measures and is in the process of implementing these”, he said.

Spelling out these measures, Mr Fernandes said: “It is a question of inducting more forces, using local intelligence for the purpose of the identification of mercenaries and also having a very swift-moving striking force which can act with great speed in areas where the movements of mercenaries are noticed. We expect better results in the coming days”.

On the continuous heavy artillery firing by Pakistan along LoC, he said “Pakistan is orchestrating incidents on the border to create a sense of alarm and project Jammu and Kashmir as a flashpoint. Pakistan’s desperation is becoming acute in view of the fast-declining support in the valley to militancy”.

On the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), he said: “the discriminatory part is that it says that those of us who have (nuclear bomb) will have, and those of you who don’t have, will never have. Now we have said that we have”.

Asked what India expected from the USA in return for signing CTBT, he said: “There is no give and take involved. What is involved is the acceptance and realisation that India is a nuclear weapon state, in the same way as the USA, China, Russia or other nuclear weapon states only the right to go about their business. So do we have the right to go about our business”.

In an interview to Star TV tonight, he said nuclear deterrent did not have any place in resolving the situation along the LoC in Kashmir and India’s efforts were to bring Pakistan to the negotiating table on all bilateral issues.
If at all there is any conflict on Kashmir it would be a conventional one to be ""tackled in a way it is tackled"", he said.

However, it was ""premature"" to make any observation on the situation in the border, he said adding that the Prime Ministers of both countries were scheduled to hold discussions in Durban (South Africa) later this month. He hoped that talks between the two countries would continue.","Indian Defence Minister George Fernandes emphasized reclaiming parts of Jammu and Kashmir under Pakistani control, rejecting the conversion of the Line of Control (LoC) into an international border. He highlighted the occupied area by Pakistan and expressed reluctance towards transforming the LoC. Fernandes acknowledged the presence of Chinese-controlled regions in Jammu and Kashmir, discouraging premature speculation on potential outcomes. Addressing recent massacres, he accused Pakistan of a sinister plot to incite Hindu-Muslim tensions. Fernandes outlined strategic measures, including increased forces and local intelligence utilization, to counteract mercenaries. He attributed Pakistan's artillery firing to desperation amid waning support for militancy in Kashmir. On the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), Fernandes emphasized India's nuclear status and rejected the notion of bargaining with the USA.

RLM supports SAD on Udham Singh Nagar

LUCKNOW, Aug 9 (PTI) — The Rashtriya Loktantrik Morcha (RLM) today supported the Shiromani Akali Dal in opposing the Vajpayee Government’s decision to include Udham Singh Nagar in Uttaranchal state and demanded the exclusion of some plains of Garhwal division from the proposed state, giving a new twist to the controversy.

""The RLM would not allow the inclusion of Hardwar and Udham Singh Nagar in the proposed Uttaranchal state and at the same time would press taking some areas of the plains of Garhwal division into Uttar Pradesh,"" RLM president Mulayam Singh Yadav told a mammoth rally here.

He said ""we have already registered our protest with the President of India"" on the issue and threatened to take to the streets if the BJP-led government at the Centre did not reverse its decision to include Udham Singh Nagar in the proposed Uttaranchal to be carved out of Uttar Pradesh.

Mr Yadav’s remarks came two days after the Shiromani Akali Dal, a key constituent of the Vajpayee Government, threatened to withdraw support to it if the decision to include Udham Singh Nagar in Uttaranchal was not rescinded.

He attacked the United Front Government for not doing anything to dislodge or weaken the BJP coalition government and said the Vajpayee government was in the saddle because of the betrayal by a section of front leaders.

The RLM today reiterated its support to the Congress if it takes initiative in dislodging the Vajpayee Government at the Centre.

""It is high time the Congress comes forward and the morcha will come out openly to support it"", RLM president Mulayam Singh Yadav said expressing dismay at the reluctance of the Congress to initiate the removal of the Vajpayee Government.

Addressing a mammoth rally at the historic Hazratmahal Park, he described the BJP as ""dangerous"" and ""communal"", adding ""it would be a shame for the country if the National Flag is unfurled by fascist and communal forces on Independence Day"".

Speaking at the rally, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) President Laloo Prasad claimed the RLM would emerge as a ""political force to reckon with and would be able to defeat the communal and fascist forces"".

Asserting ""the Laloo-Mulayam combination would now lead the sarvahara samaj (proletariat) to the seat of power in Delhi, he asked ""is there anyone other than Mr Mulayam Singh Yadav who could be projected as the Prime Minister in the country?""

""We committed a mistake on this count earlier, but would not repeat it now"", he said.

The RJD President also criticised the BJP government for its failure on the diplomatic front.

Referring to the Srikrishna report which indicted the Shiv Sena and Mr Bal Thackeray for their role in the Mumbai riots in the aftermath of the Babri Masjid demolition, the former Defence Minister said ""if the Sena leaders are not put behind bars, the RLM would wage a long drawn agitation and ensure that they are punished"".

Referring to joining hands with RJD leader Laloo Prasad Yadav and forming the morcha, Mr Yadav said ""we would stand together like a rock and are prepared to lay down our lives if the guilty are not punished"".

Assuring full protection to the minorities, he criticised the Maharashtra Government for deporting and ill-treating the Bengalis, Muslims and those from other parts of the country from Mumbai by calling them as foreign nationals.

Mr Mulayam Singh criticised the United Front for letting him and the RJD President down. ""The present Vajpayee government was in the saddle because of the betrayal by a section of the front leaders"", he said.

""The front leaders were not doing anything to dislodge or weaken the BJP coalition government"", Mr Yadav said.

The RLM, Mr Mulayam Singh said ""would not allow the inclusion of Hardwar and Udham Singh Nagar in the proposed Uttaranchal state and at the same time would also press for some areas of the plains of Garhwal division into Uttar Pradesh.

We have already registered our protest with the President and will take the issue to the streets by launching an agitation if the decision is not reversed"", he said.

Alleging that ""jungle rule"" prevailed in Uttar Pradesh, he said ""innocent persons were being killed in fake encounters, atrocities on the backwards and the Dalits had increased and there was total chaos at all levels"".

Describing the anti-copying ordinance as a ""black ordinance"", Mr Yadav said if they came to power in the state, the ""draconian legislation"" would be repealed ""within 10 minutes of assuming power. A commission would also be set up to look into the circumstances in which the ordinance was issued"".

Others who addressed the rally included Bihar Chief Minister Rabri Devi, independent MP Buta Singh and Telugu Desam Party leader Lakshmi Parvathi.","Defence Minister George Fernandes reaffirmed India's stance on reclaiming areas of Jammu and Kashmir under Pakistani control, dismissing any conversion of the Line of Control (LoC) into an international border.

The Tribune,1998-08-11 00:00:00,Jaya threatens to ditch BJP Insists on original Cauvery draft," The AIADMK-led front in Tamil Nadu today threatened to withdraw support to the Vajpayee government if it did not notify the original draft scheme to implement the Cauvery water interim award by August 12 and said there was ""genuine doubt"" that the Centre had agreed not to prosecute Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case in return for the acceptance of a revised scheme.

The AIADMK chief Ms J. Jayalalitha told a news conference here that the support to the Vajpayee government would be reviewed after August 12 when the Centre has been directed by the Supreme Court to report on the contentious issue.

She said she had a ""genuine doubt"" that Mr Karunanidhi and the Centre had entered into a ""quid pro quo"" deal under which the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister would not be prosecuted on the basis of the Jain Commission report in return for accepting the new scheme.

She demanded a special session of Parliament to consider the details of the new scheme which had been rejected by the AIADMK-led front.

Asked why she had been threatening the withdrawal of support to the Vajpayee government from time to time, Ms Jayalalitha said, ""one could not expect it to happen overnight.""

""Even in boxing, one does not deliver the knock out punch early. There has to be a lot of sparring,"" she said.

Ms Jayalalitha also charged that the new scheme was not discussed in the Cabinet and so the AIADMK-led front was not guilty of flouting the collective responsibility as claimed by Mr Karunanidhi.

She, however, put the entire blame on Mr Karunanidhi saying if a Chief Minister was ready for a compromise it was ""natural for any Prime Minister to take the easy way out.""

She alleged that Mr Karunanidhi had abandoned the original scheme even though there was unanimity at the all-party meeting here on August 3 that there should be no dilution of the original draft.

She said the AIADMK and its allies would have pressured the BJP-led government to notify the original draft scheme if Mr Karunanidhi had stayed away from the New Delhi meet, she added.

Claiming Karnataka had had its way in the new scheme, the AIADMK chief said the state had insisted that the monitoring committee should not have any statutory powers and it should only assist the authority.

While Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry opposed this, Kerala remained neutral, she said.

However, subsequently Tamil Nadu ""tamely"" accepted this, Ms Jayalalitha added.

She said neither Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee nor any of his representatives talked to her during the Chief Ministers’ meeting on August 6 and August 7, Mr Vajpayee had however, talked to her on August 5 and asked her for her views.

Ms Jayalalitha said she told him that nothing short of the notification of the original draft scheme would be acceptable to her.

When Mr Vajpayee wondered why there should be a controversy on the Cauvery issue as the water position was comfortable this year, she said she insisted that the matter be settled immediately as the water position might not be the the same next year.

GAYA: The Defence Minister Mr George Fernandes, has said doubts raised by AIADMK over the settlement of Cauvery water dispute will ""soon be settled’’ and will ""in no way affect the health of the Vajpayee government’’.

""The coalition partners in the Vajpayee ministry have their separate agenda. But are one on the question of stability of the government, which will complete its full term"", said Mr Fernandes, who is also the national president of Samata Party.

The initiatives for a permanent solution to the long-standing Cauvery dispute is a ""major achievement"" of the Vajpayee government, he said yesterday.

NEW DELHI: The Chief Secretaries of four Cauvery riparian states on Monday finalised a scheme for the implementation of the interim award of the Cauvery tribunal over which the Chief Ministers had reached an agreement with the Prime Minister last week.

Chief Secretaries of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka A.P. Muthusamy and B.K. Bhattacharya, said after a meeting with the Cabinet Secretary Prabhat Kumar that ""an agreed formulation of the scheme has been prepared"".

The formulation was based on the agreed decisions taken at the Prime Minister’s meeting with the Chief Ministers, they said.

Asked when the notification for implementation of the interim award would be issued, Water Resources Secretary Z. Hasan said the Cabinet Secretary would decide on the notification.","The AIADMK-led front in Tamil Nadu threatens to withdraw support from the Vajpayee government if the original draft scheme for the Cauvery water interim award isn't notified by August 12. AIADMK's Jayalalitha suspects a quid pro quo between M. Karunanidhi and the Centre regarding the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case.

Asked why she had been threatening the withdrawal of support to the Vajpayee government from time to time, Ms Jayalalitha said, ""one could not expect it to happen overnight.""

""Even in boxing, one does not deliver the knock out punch early. There has to be a lot of sparring,"" she said.

Ms Jayalalitha also charged that the new scheme was not discussed in the Cabinet and so the AIADMK-led front was not guilty of flouting the collective responsibility as claimed by Mr Karunanidhi.

She, however, put the entire blame on Mr Karunanidhi saying if a Chief Minister was ready for a compromise it was ""natural for any Prime Minister to take the easy way out.""

She alleged that Mr Karunanidhi had abandoned the original scheme even though there was unanimity at the all-party meeting here on August 3 that there should be no dilution of the original draft.

She said the AIADMK and its allies would have pressured the BJP-led government to notify the original draft scheme if Mr Karunanidhi had stayed away from the New Delhi meet, she added.

Claiming Karnataka had had its way in the new scheme, the AIADMK chief said the state had insisted that the monitoring committee should not have any statutory powers and it should only assist the authority.

While Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry opposed this, Kerala remained neutral, she said.

However, subsequently Tamil Nadu ""tamely"" accepted this, Ms Jayalalitha added.

She said neither Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee nor any of his representatives talked to her during the Chief Ministers’ meeting on August 6 and August 7, Mr Vajpayee had however, talked to her on August 5 and asked her for her views.

Ms Jayalalitha said she told him that nothing short of the notification of the original draft scheme would be acceptable to her.

When Mr Vajpayee wondered why there should be a controversy on the Cauvery issue as the water position was comfortable this year, she said she insisted that the matter be settled immediately as the water position might not be the the same next year.

GAYA: The Defence Minister Mr George Fernandes, has said doubts raised by AIADMK over the settlement of Cauvery water dispute will ""soon be settled’’ and will ""in no way affect the health of the Vajpayee government’’.

""The coalition partners in the Vajpayee ministry have their separate agenda. But are one on the question of stability of the government, which will complete its full term"", said Mr Fernandes, who is also the national president of Samata Party.

The initiatives for a permanent solution to the long-standing Cauvery dispute is a ""major achievement"" of the Vajpayee government, he said yesterday.

NEW DELHI: The Chief Secretaries of four Cauvery riparian states on Monday finalised a scheme for the implementation of the interim award of the Cauvery tribunal over which the Chief Ministers had reached an agreement with the Prime Minister last week.

Chief Secretaries of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka A.P. Muthusamy and B.K. Bhattacharya, said after a meeting with the Cabinet Secretary Prabhat Kumar that ""an agreed formulation of the scheme has been prepared"".

The formulation was based on the agreed decisions taken at the Prime Minister’s meeting with the Chief Ministers, they said.

Asked when the notification for implementation of the interim award would be issued, Water Resources Secretary Z. Hasan said the Cabinet Secretary would decide on the notification.","The AIADMK-led front in Tamil Nadu has threatened to withdraw support from the Vajpayee government if it doesn't notify the original draft scheme for the Cauvery water interim award by August 12. AIADMK chief J. Jayalalitha expressed doubt about a possible deal between Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi and the Centre, suggesting a quid pro quo for not prosecuting Karunanidhi in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case. She demanded a special session of Parliament to discuss the new scheme rejected by the AIADMK-led front. Jayalalitha accused Karunanidhi of abandoning the original scheme and blamed him for compromising with Karnataka in the new scheme. The Defence Minister, George Fernandes, dismissed the AIADMK's concerns, stating that the doubts would soon be settled and wouldn't affect the stability of the Vajpayee government.",Politics,127,741

Jayalalitha an ""extra-constitutional authority"" today caught the party Central leadership unawares as it was making a conscious effort to downplay her latest threat of review of support to the Vajpayee government.

While the BJP vice-president, Mr K.L. Sharma, stressed that there was no threat to the BJP-led coalition government at the Centre as the Prime Minister, Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee, would get the problem resolved, a senior leader from Karnataka, Mr H.N. Nanjegowda, said the central government would not be pressurised by the ""extra-constitutional authority"" of Ms Jayalalitha on the Cauvery issue.

Responding to newspersons' questions on Ms Jayalalitha’s ultimatum of reviewing her party’s support to the government, Mr Sharma expressed confidence that the Prime Minister would get the problem resolved through talks. Mr Vajpayee would hoist the National Flag at the historic Red Fort on August 15, Mr Sharma said in reply to a question.

The Vajpayee government was being run on consensus and decisions taken after consulting allies, the BJP leader said. ""We take our allies' concerns,views and suggestions seriously"", Mr Sharma said, adding ""We are confident that the Prime Minister would sort out all their problems"".

Earlier, Mr Nanjegowda said, ""Enough is enough. How long can we suffer this attitude? She is a nobody. She is only trying to make political gains. I am confident the government will not submit itself to such extra-constitutional authority on the Cauvery agreement.""

""Our government will not tolerate the blackmail tactics of anybody or the intervention of any exta-constitutional authority"", Mr Nanjegowda, who was one of the key advisers to the Centre on resolving the impasse regarding implementation of interim reward of the Cauvery tribunal, said.

The Lok Sabha was prorogued today. This in effect means that for summoning a session of the House a statutory period of a fortnight has to be provided. Thus, in case the AIADMK and other Tamil Nadu allies decide to withdraw support in the next few days, the strength of the government can only be ascertained by a meeting of the Lok Sabha which can at best be called towards the end of August or beginning of September. (Had the House not been prorogued today, considering the fact that a joint session of Parliament is due on August 15, a meeting of the Lok Sabha could have been called next week itself.)","The Atal Behari Vajpayee government faces a challenging situation as two allies threaten to withdraw support over issues concerning land (Udham Singh Nagar) and water (Cauvery). With the Lok Sabha prorogued, a fortnight's statutory period is required to convene a session, delaying the government's ability to gauge its strength amidst potential defections. If the AIADMK and other Tamil Nadu allies proceed with withdrawal, the government's fate will only be determined by a Lok Sabha meeting towards late August or early September.

the pioneer,1998-08-13 00:00:00,Jaya races with rupee in shedding value,"Tamil Nadu’s “Iron Lady” has set a blistering pace in her race with the rupee. So far it is a neck-and-neck affair, both shedding value every few weeks. There are differences though between the two. The lady’s is purely a self-willed effort while the currency is a victim of outside manipulation. Two, the fortunes of the lady in question may not smile soon, but the rupee should get relief once the regional environment turns favourable.

For the AIADMK “strong man”, the latest fiasco is the most grievous. (It does not mean that she cannot cause herself a more serious wound.) Her action, rather over-reaction, had all the ingredients of a classic misjudgement. The Cauvery is the wrong issue. This is the wrong year. The timing was hopelessly wrong. The resort to a dire threat was self-destructive.

And, horror of horrors, she had no fall-back position. Retreating from the brink is the loudest proclamation of one’s self-doubt and surrender. In today’s world waverers don’t win and winners don’t waver. She has blinked first in an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation with the BJP. The present ruling combine is not the toughest of rivals and to invite a humiliating defeat at its hands!

No doubt, Ms Jayalalitha has lost the nimble political touch she showed in putting together a winning alliance in February. Perhaps she is sure-footed in dealing with her own Dravidian fans and foes but fumbles with non-Tamilians. If this be the case, it speaks volumes of her immaturity.

Let us start with her selection of the Cauvery issue for hurling a blood pressure-inducing threat at the BJP-led ruling combine. It is what may loosely be called a secular issue, in that any leader or any political party can take it up with any degree of vehemence either sincerely or to get electoral mileage.

For this reason it is a double-edged weapon, subject to the law of “winner takes all”. By the same token, the loser loses all. Given this inherent risk, Ms Jayalalitha should not have underestimated the political sagacity of her arch rival Karunanidhi or overestimated her own capacity to armtwist the Prime Minister and his advisers. She grossly miscalculated and is, therefore, gasping for breath under the debris.

Two, this is the wrong year to invoke the Cauvery to take out an insurance against electoral loss. The weather god has been very generous and there is ample water to please the kisan in both Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The demand for irrigation water is an emotional issue and no one, not even the mighty Jayalalitha, can whip up mass emotion when there is no crisis. She should know.

In 1995, as Chief Minister, she went on a theatrical hunger strike demanding a greater share of water to the state’s farmers and emerged as the sole voice and sword arm of the farming community. But 1998 is not 1995, and any melodramatic gesture of a repeat fast is likely to be misconstrued as an attempt to get rid of the so many kilos of accumulated fat.

In what will go down as an unpardonable snafu, she challenged three men who were desperate to score a victory, any victory, at this time. The Prime Minister wanted to tell the countrymen that he can do more useful things than ordering the Pokhran blasts. In other words, he was keen to prove that he is also a doer, not merely a poet. The Cauvery issue presented him with an excellent opportunity.

Karnataka Chief Minister J.H. Patel is caught up in one of his periodic crises. And the Cauvery interim award has gone badly against his state. He wanted several amendments to the old award and was ready to bargain. Of the three key negotiators, he is the biggest winner. He has managed to remove restrictive clauses from the interim award like the ban on improving the existing canal system or expanding the area under irrigation (11 lakh hectares), while also wresting veto power.

Mr Karunanidhi has been equally successful in inching back to the centre-stage of state politics. And by the same token in marginalising our tough lady. The last lingering opposition to the interim award has been overcome. The monitoring committee cannot offer much benefit but the high-powered Cauvery River Authority cannot cause damage either (the state weilds a veto).

In the days to come, Ms Jayalalitha would rue her haste in sounding the bugle before charting a retreat route. All agitationist politicians respect a golden rule: it is not necessary that one should win all battles but it is absolutely essential that one does not lose face. Ms Jayalalitha would learn this lesson the hard way and benefit the second time, if there is a second time.","The article discusses the recent political developments involving J. Jayalalitha, the leader of AIADMK (All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) in Tamil Nadu. It criticizes her handling of the Cauvery water-sharing issue, calling it a ""classic misjudgement"" and a ""horror of horrors."" The author argues that Jayalalitha's threat to withdraw support from the Vajpayee Government was a miscalculation, and she has lost the nimble political touch she displayed earlier. The timing of her actions is questioned, considering the favorable weather conditions and the absence of a water crisis. The article suggests that Jayalalitha underestimated her political rivals and overestimated her ability to influence the central government.

Cauvery scheme: SC decision on Aug 17

NEW DELHI, Aug 12 (PTI) — A five-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court will decide on August 17 whether Tamil Nadu’s suit seeking the implementation of the 1991 interim award of the Cauvery Tribunal survives in view of the Centre notifying a revised scheme on the sharing of the river waters.

Directing the placing of the matter before the Constitution Bench, a three judge Bench headed by Chief Justice M.M. Punchhi said the court was happy that a solution had been found to the vexed issue within the August 12 deadline.

Attorney-General Soli Sorabjee informed the court that the Centre had been able to frame the scheme in consultation with the four riparian states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and Pondicherry.

He said with the notification of the scheme prima facie the suit did not survive and could be disposed of. The scheme might now be placed before the five-judge Bench for appropriate orders.

Senior counsel for Karnataka F.S. Nariman submitted that the scheme was arrived at by the Government of India in consultation with all four states and not by a consensus. ""We wanted something different and we may not be happy, but the government has framed the scheme.""

When the judges asked senior counsel for Tamil Nadu K. Parasaran whether the state intended to withdraw the suit, he said he had no instructions in this regard.

Mr Nariman submitted that nothing probably would survive in the suit but still Karnataka might like to advance some arguments on the issue.

The judges observed that with the framing of the scheme the challenge in the suit virtually vanished. But the five-judge Bench would have to consider the matter before disposing of the suit.

When Mr Nariman told the judges that the scheme needed examination, the Bench observed that the homework done by the Centre and as reflected in the files showed that there had been consultations.

Mr Nariman, however, pointed out that though there were consultations, there was no concurrence on certain points in the scheme notified by the Centre.

The Attorney-General said though there was no consensus there was no opposition either to the scheme.

Mr Sorabjee thanked the Bench for giving time to the Centre to achieve the breakthrough in the vexed issue and in a lighter vein said the setting of a deadline helped reach a solution faster.

He said in due course and in accordance with the law, the scheme notified would be placed before Parliament for further deliberations.

The Centre notified a revised scheme for the implementation of the Cauvery Water Tribunal’s interim award yesterday unmindful of a threat from AIADMK leader J. Jayalalitha, who has opposed the agreement reached between the four riparian states.

The Tribune,1998-08-13 00:00:00,Congress waiting for govt to fall,"NEW DELHI, Aug 12 — As uncertainty crept in over the fate of the five-month-old Atal Behari Vajpayee government following the threat of withdrawal of support by the AIADMK, the Congress stated it was keeping a close watch on political developments.

The Congress, which does not want to be perceived as having triggered a political crisis, today claimed that some party leaders were in touch with the AIADMK.

""As a responsible political party, we are keeping a watch on the sequence of developments,"" the party spokesperson, Dr Gijra Vyas, said today.

Having stated that the party was ready to form a government in the event of collapse of the BJP-led coalition, the Congress preferred to remain a spectator.

Dr Vyas said that officially there was no contact with the AIADMK but some leaders have been in touch with the political party in Tamil Nadu, which threatened to review support to the ruling coalition at the Centre over the Cauvery water issue.

The Congress President, Mrs Sonia Gandhi, continued to hold informal discussions with senior party leaders and Congress Working Committee members on the latest political situation.

Party sources said that while some CWC members preferred to join the fray in formation of an alternate government another section advised that the time was not yet ripe for the Congress to strike.

The Congress leadership is likely to summon a meeting of the CWC at a short notice tomorrow in the event of the AIADMK carrying out its threat, the sources said.

Much would depend on the outcome of the meeting of the AIADMK and its allies scheduled to be held at Chennai tomorrow.

Many Congress members were of the opinion that the AIADMK supremo Ms Jayalalitha may take a strong stand specially in the light of the fact that even as Chief Minister, she had gone on hunger strike over the issue.

GUWAHATI (PTI): The Congress will ""step in"" if the AIADMK withdraws support and the Vajpayee government falls ""for which there is every possibility,"" senior Congress leader Rajesh Pilot said here today.

""According to my information, the AIADMK is going to withdraw support after tomorrow’s crucial meeting convened by Jayalalitha,"" Congress Working Committee (CWC) member, Mr Pilot told PTI.

""In that case do you think that the Congress will keep quiet? we will definitely step in"", Mr Pilot said.

Earlier, at a press conference, he said Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee was ""silent"" on the Srikrishna Commission report on communal riots in Mumbai in 1992-93 and said ""it is sad that the government had sidelined the report which amounts to attacking the judiciary"".

""The Prime Minister’s silence on it is intriguing,"" Mr Pilot said alleging that there was a ""move to shake the basic democratic values.""

Attacking the Prafulla Kumar Mahanta government in Assam, the former union minister said that they had ""failed"" on all fronts and the ""failure"" to contain insurgency was due to ""lack of any transparent policy"" on the matter.

""The Bodo accord is null and void and the economy was crumbling and that is why we have demanded President’s rule in the state,"" he said.

Mr Pilot, who was here to attend the state Youth Congress convention which ended yesterday, said he supported the Assam Government’s demand for central reimbursement for security-related expenditure in the state in line with Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab.

Former Lok Sabha Speaker P.A. Sangma said the North-East MPs forum had been formed under his chairmanship to adopt a common approach to the problems of the region and raise them in Parliament. A 10-member executive of the forum has been constituted with three members from Assam.

The forum had submitted a memorandum to the Prime Minister demanding implementation of the special package of Rs 7300 crore for the North-East as announced by former PM H.D. Deve Gowda.

The memorandum also demanded spending of 10 per cent of the budget allocation of each ministry for the North-East, reimbursement of security-related expenditure by the Centre and reorganisation of the North Eastern Council, Mr Sangma said adding that the Prime Minister had assured him that he would consider the demands and implement them.

Assam Pradesh Congress Committee President Tarun Gogoi held the CBI responsible for the Governor not according sanction to prosecute Chief Minister Prafulla Kumar Mahanta in the multi-crore LOC scam.

""It is surprising that the Governor refused permission. But the CBI should be responsible for their approaching the Governor to prosecute the Chief Minister. If there was no prima facie case why did the CBI approach the Governor at all,"" he said.","The AIADMK is threatening to withdraw support from the Vajpayee government, which could lead to its collapse. The Congress is watching the situation closely and is ready to step in if the government falls. The Congress is also critical of the Vajpayee government's silence on the Srikrishna Commission report and its handling of the economy. In Assam, the Congress is demanding President's rule and criticizing the Mahanta government for its handling of the insurgency and the economy. The North-East MPs forum has been formed to raise the region's problems in Parliament. The Congress is also criticizing the CBI for its role in the LOC scam.",Politics,105,760
The Tribune,1998-08-13 00:00:00,"No headway in talks with Jaya AIADMK, allies meet today","Suspense heightened tonight over the fate of the BJP-led coalition at the Centre as the AIADMK and its allies are meeting here tomorrow possibly to review their support to the Vajpayee Government after two rounds of talks between Prime Minister’s emissaries and AIADMK supremo J. Jayalalitha appeared to have made no headway.

Defence Minister George Fernandes and BJP leader Pramod Mahajan, who flew here this morning in a bid to mollify her in the wake of yesterday’s notification of the scheme for implementation of the Cauvery tribunal’s interim award, strongly opposed by her, met her twice and left for Delhi.

Speculation was rife that AIADMK and its allies are likely to announce the withdrawal of support after she decided to go ahead with tomorrow’s meeting. There was no authoritative version of what Jayalalitha discussed with the two emissaries, who also left for the Capital evading reporters.

An AIADMK source said that Jayalalitha stuck to her demand that the Centre should notify the original draft scheme of 1997 and expressed annoyance over the fact that the government had chosen to implement a revised scheme agreed upon by the chief ministers of four riparian states last week. ""The emissaries had nothing new to offer,’’ the source said.

Earlier, Mr Fernandes and Mr Mahajan deftly avoided the Press.

Reporters waiting to meet the two leaders at the airport on their arrival were disappointed when the two leaders did not meet them and drove out of the tarmac.

Intelligence personnel trailing the two leaders lost track when the vehicles carrying them sped the nearby Officers’ Training Academy complex which was inaccessible.

Mr Fernandes and Mr Mahajan travelled in hired taxis to Ms Jayalalitha’s Poes Garden residence in South Chennai.

They travelled in separate taxis, but arrived almost at the same time around 11 a.m. at her residence.

After the talks, the two leaders left Ms Jayalalitha’s residence at noon in the same taxis to an unknown destination, apparently to brief the Prime Minister on the outcome over the phone.

Scores of print and electronic media personnel virtually waylaid them when the two leaders came out of the huge iron gates of Ms Jayalalitha’s bungalow, but they again sped away.

On two occasions earlier when he had met Ms Jayalalitha to buy peace for the BJP-led coalition government, Mr Fernandes had briefed reporters outside the AIADMK leader’s house.","The fate of the BJP-led coalition government at the Centre is uncertain as the AIADMK and its allies are set to meet, possibly to reconsider their support. Prime Minister's emissaries, Defense Minister George Fernandes and BJP leader Pramod Mahajan, held two rounds of talks with AIADMK leader J. Jayalalitha, but the discussions yielded no apparent progress. There is speculation that the AIADMK and its allies might announce the withdrawal of support. Jayalalitha insisted on the notification of the original draft scheme from 1997, expressing displeasure over the government's implementation of a revised scheme agreed upon by the chief ministers of four riparian states. The emissaries, Fernandes and Mahajan, left for Delhi without providing new solutions. Media personnel were unable to get details as the leaders avoided interaction and left Jayalalitha's residence without addressing reporters.

Jayalalitha today refrained from withdrawing support to the Vajpayee Government though she was authorised by the front to take ""an appropriate decision at the appropriate time"" on the issue.

""The question of withdrawal of (our) ministers does not arise now"", Union Minister V.K. Ramamurthy told reporters at the end of a 90-minute meeting of the AIADMK and its allies with speculation rife that this was the minimum Ms Jayalalitha was expected to do to set the alarm bells ringing.

Today's meeting of the front at her residence after the failure of talks with the Prime Minister's emissaries yesterday turned out to be another round of ""sparring"" without a ""knock-out punch"" which Ms Jayalalitha had earlier hinted at as it merely resulted in her being authorised to decide on the issue.

Briefing reporters at the end of the 90-minute meeting, Mr Ramamurthy did not rule out the possibility of another meeting on the issue in the near future, saying ""if necessary, we will definitely meet again.""

Mr Ramamurthy said the AIADMK front had rejected outright the recent accord reached on the Cauvery waters issue.

The other leaders of the AIADMK's alliance parties were also present at the briefing.

The meeting was convened by Ms Jayalalitha to discuss the issue of reviewing support to the Vajpayee Government following the Centre's decision to notify the new scheme evolved in consultation with the chief ministers of four riparian states at a meeting with Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee last week.

The notification ignored the threat of reviewing support by Ms Jayalalitha who insisted on the acceptance of the original draft scheme, saying the new scheme was detrimental to the interests of Tamil Nadu.

AIADMK leader Nedunchezhiyan and leaders of alliance partners like Dr Subramanian Swamy (Janata Party), Dr S. Ramadoss (PMK) and Mr Vaiko (MDMK) were also present when Mr Ramamurthy briefed the press on the outcome of the meeting.

After the meeting, all leaders left in one car.

Meanwhile, two top Congress leaders, former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Janardhan Reddy and former union minister Jagdish Tytler, arrived in the city, strengthening speculation that they were here to give an assurance to Ms Jayalalitha about an alternative government at the Centre.

Mr Reddy told a private television channel here that the Congress would not shirk its reponsibility, if it was called upon to form a government after the fall of the Vajpayee Government.

Front sources said before the meeting that there was no unanimity among the allies on the issue of pulling out of the Vajpayee Government as some of the allies would not be ""comfortable"" in a set-up headed by the Congress.

Union Minister M. Thambidurai who along with Mr Kadambur M.R. Janardhanam was present at the meeting, declined to say anything on the nature of the deliberations.

Going by the briefing, it appeared that the Vajpayee Government had got a breather for the time being as a decision was only deferred.

The meeting heightened media interest with even Delhi-based correspondents of leading US papers descending on Poes Garden.

A large number of partymen and curious passersby stayed put outside Ms Jayalalitha's residence when the meeting was going on and refused to leave even after the formal briefing by Mr Ramamurthy.

NEW DELHI: The Congress today denied that it had sent any emissary to Chennai to meet AIADMK chief J. Jayalalitha seeking her party’s support in the formation of a Congress-led government at the Centre in case she decided to pull out of the Vajpayee Government.

Unofficial reports put the toll at more than 100. Rudraprayag Subdivisional Magistrate Lalitmohan Upreti told UNI that 15 bodies had been recovered.

The region has been lashed by incessant rain since Tuesday.

Most of the victims were either buried under the debris of the landslides which destroyed hundreds of houses or swept away by flash floods.

An entire village in Rudraprayag district, Raunlake, was wiped out.

Property worth crores of rupees was also destroyed.

Acting on a SOS sent by Rudraprayag District Magistrate Babulal Meena, several units of the army and para military forces started rescue and relief operations in the region.

Officials said rescue operations were being hampered by continuous downpour.

The death toll was expected to rise because many villages had not yet been approached by officials and rescue workers.

Uttar Pradesh State Minister Matbar Singh Kandri and Garhwal region Commissioner Brijmohan Vora visited some of the affected villages and assured all possible help to the victims.

Twentyone deaths were reported yesterday due to the incessant rain that caused widespread damage in the Ukhimath block of the district.

So far, the maximum number of deaths were reported from villages of Gaid, Gargu, Barua and Tiloji, sources said.

PAC and police jawans were also carrying out relief and rescue operations with top administrative officials supervising the work amidst adverse weather.

Traffic came to a halt at many points and the Rudraprayag-Kedarnath route was damaged at several places, the sources said.

While the bodies of most of the victims had been recovered, 10 seriously injured were admitted to hospital.

The sources feared the toll might shoot up to more than 100 as a number of people were reported missing.

Among the dead were 32 from village Rawalekh, seven from Gahar village, five from Pilaunji, five from Jaggi Bagawan, two from Bedala, three from Kalimath, three from Burba, three from Ransi, two from Kunjethe, two from Kawita and one each from Katama, Gondar and Uniyana, the sources said.

Torrential rain today continued to lash Ookhimath obstructing relief and rescue operations, the sources said.

In the landslides and heavy-rain hit areas of Ookhimath, potable water supply, electricity supply and telecommunication facilities were disrupted, the sources said.

Uttaranchal Development Minister Ramesh Pokhariyal ""Nishank"" had made an aerial survey of the affected areas by a helicopter.

In the neighbouring Bihar, the toll in the current spell of floods rose to 155 with eight more deaths reported today as the overall flood situation continued to be grim, official sources said.

State Relief and Rehabilitation Department sources said three deaths were reported from Saharsa during the day, while two others perished in the flood waters in Samastipur.

One death each was reported from Muzaffarpur, Sitamarhi and Gopalganj districts, the sources said.

The floods, the sources said, affected about nine million people in 23 districts in the state, washed away cattle, damaged crops, houses and property worth several crores of rupees.","At least 69 people are feared dead in landslides and flash floods caused by continuous rain in the Garhwal region of northern Uttar Pradesh, with some reports suggesting the death toll could be over 100.

""India and Pakistan, I think, now that both countries have these weapons, it would drive home to both, the inescapable need to settle the differences between them peacefully and through negotiations,"" the President said in a rare interview given to journalist, N. Ram.

Mr Narayanan dispensed with the message usually broadcast on the eve of Independence Day and instead chose the mode of conversation to convey his views on various topics.

The President said nuclear tests by India ""gave a very salutary shock to the complacency of the great powers and the world opinion, which was moulded by them,"" but did not agree with the view that the country had ""lost the high moral ground"" after the tests.

Replying to a question that India seemed to have a lot of difficulty at present in responding to the post-Pokhran situation, Mr Narayanan said, ""Well, difficulties there are, but I don’t think we have lost the moral high ground as you say. I think India has to be looked at as any other country. We cannot and we should not claim to occupy a higher moral ground than any other country.

""Certainly, we have had a tradition of high philosophy and great moral principles. So had Europe. Christ preached all these principles. But still they develop nuclear weapons and pile up such weapons. But nobody tells them they have fallen from the high moral ground,"" Mr Narayanan said.

The President felt that nuclear weapons were not necessary for the world and ""they should be abolished. But, as a pragmatist, I would say that they can be abolished not in parts but wholly. Because the weapons in the hands of any one country alone or a group of countries could be dangerous for the world as a whole and for the rest of humanity.""

He said the world had for the past 10 to 15 years seemed to have forgotten that this vast arsenal of nuclear weapons existed among the five great powers because they are quiet about it.

""But when we conducted the tests, then suddenly everybody has woken up and feels that there is such a threat,"" he said.

On the problems arising in Sino-Indian relations, Mr Narayanan felt that these were ""temporary"" and were the ""result of misunderstanding of India and Indian objectives in this region.

""There has been no change in India’s need for living in harmony and in cooperation with all our neighbours, including Pakistan and of course our big neighbour China, and others. This is India’s need, and if I may say so, and India’s policy also has been in that direction,"" he said.

The President felt that there was mutuality of interest between India and China in being friends and cooperating with each other fully.

""Of course, there are problems between us and these problems can be solved and we have been attempting to solve it, both countries, and that process will, I think, go on. Even with Pakistan, I don’t despair, in regard to our friendly relations,"" the President said.

On use of communalism as a political mobilisation strategy, Mr Narayanan said, ""I think we can bring it under control. In retrospect, I feel that we could have brought the earlier tragedy (demolition of the Babri masjid) also under control.

""Communal mobilisation in the long run will not succeed in India because Indian society cannot be mobilised communally. Even the last elections have shown that communities, religious communities, castes did not vote solidly for one party,"" he said.

The President said though there had been some mobilisation on caste and communal basis, this was not successful even in the past.

""The Hindu vote, the upper class Hindu vote was divided. The backward class vote was divided. The Scheduled Castes votes were divided. And as time goes on, it will become less and less appealing to the people. This is the trend as I see it,"" he said.

On economic reforms, Mr Narayanan felt that there was need to ""have a balanced approach to liberalisation and also to globalisation,"" since ""liberalisation is an irreversible process.""

He said economic liberalisation is a world phenomenon and all countries — socialist and capitalist — have to take to liberalisation.

""We have to adopt policies, dictated by the circumstances and the necessities of the time. We in India, as a result of our planned economic development, not central planning, but mixed planning, mixed economy, we have experimented with, we have moved to a stage of partial maturity of the economy, when we needed new forms of management, new forms of expression of the spirit of enterprise, so that the economy can move forward. The compulsion to liberalisation and globalisation arose from this,"" he said.

On the argument of political scientists that age of sovereignty was over and they wanted frontierless, borderless world, the President said it was a ""very dangerous philosophy which may suit the most developed and powerful countries of the world, and not those who are small and developing.

""That is why we are rather cautious in our liberalisation policy. We went ahead in certain sectors. We went rather slowly in other sectors. And this has helped us,"" Mr Narayanan said.

On the Women’s Reservation Bill which was stalled in the Lok Sabha at the introductory stage, Mr Narayanan said he had ""no doubt that even the women’s reservation question will be finally adopted"" in spite of ""this backward movement, sometimes, the movement is going forward, essentially. And it’s a very, very intricate problem.""

He said everybody loved his mother, sisters and relatives but still, with all this there was this callous attitude and ill-treatment towards women. ""So women’s movements are necessary.""

""One thing which is forgotten in India is the transformation of the attitude of men. It is in this field that active work has to be done. We all preach to women that they should assert themselves. But on the other hand, we don’t tell sufficient early, strongly, to the male that they should behave well. Their attitude should change,"" he said.

The President felt that land reforms were necessary as they would ""give a sense of economic liberalisation to the masses.

""I think the basic thing we have done or we attempted to do, in the beginning, and we have not yet completed that process, is that of land reforms,"" he said.","President K.R. Narayanan expressed optimism that possessing nuclear weapons would encourage India and Pakistan to settle differences peacefully. He dismissed the notion of a nuclear danger between the two nations, emphasizing the need for both countries to acknowledge the inevitability of having nuclear capabilities and resolve disputes through negotiations. Narayanan credited India's nuclear tests with disrupting the complacency of great powers, rejecting the idea that the country had lost moral high ground. Regarding Sino-Indian relations, he considered problems temporary and attributed them to misunderstandings. On communalism, Narayanan believed India's diverse society would resist communal mobilization, noting a trend of diminishing appeal. He advocated a balanced approach to economic liberalization and globalisation, emphasizing the need for policies dictated by circumstances. The President supported land reforms and stressed the necessity of transforming men's attitudes for women's empowerment.",Politics,135,1120
The Tribune,1998-08-16 00:00:00,"N-tech for peace, not war: PM Refuses to compromise to stay in power","Reiterating India’s readiness to talk to Pakistan on all aspects of bilateral relations anywhere and anytime, the Prime Minister, Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee, today assured that the country will never use nuclear weapons for aggression and stressed that no power on earth can force New Delhi to deviate from its chosen path of global disarmament.

In his first address to the nation from the historic ramparts of the Red Fort on the country’s 52nd Independence Day, Mr Vajpayee said India was all for a nuclear-weapon free world and, therefore, had immediately after the Pokhran tests announced a unilateral moratorium on further nuclear tests.

""We are not doing all this under someone’s pressure or any fear. We are doing it on our own to live up to our goals of world peace and global disarmament.We want to fulfil our dream of a nuclear-weapon free world"", the Prime Minister said, signalling to the western world that New Delhi would not sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in its present form. ""Our tests of May 11 and 13 were not meant for any war"", he pointed out.

Mr Vajpayee,who stressed on the country’s policy to have good relations with all its neighbours, including Pakistan, regretted not getting a positive response from the Pakistani Prime Minister, Mr Nawaz Sharif, during their meeting in Colombo on the sidelines of the SAARC summit. ""But I have not given up hope and will go to Durban, South Africa, to attend the Non-Aligned Movement summit with a fervent hope that Mr Sharif will give a response"", he said.

""I do believe that there is no problem which cannot be resolved through dialogue. Therefore, whether it is Pakistan or China, we will carry out friendly talks to find a way out for all bilateral problems"", the Prime Minister said.

Referring to the proxy war which was being aided and abetted from across the border, the Prime Minister said his government was firm on rooting out terrorism from Jammu and Kashmir. In the recent past, there has been a rise in terrorism, he said, and added that the massacre in Chamba district of Himachal Pradesh was ""part of a big conspiracy. We will fight terrorism with all our might"", and added that this would be crushed with a heavy hand.

Stating that India believed in ""peaceful co-existence"", the Prime Minister said it did not mean that ""we are not bothered about our frontiers"". Modernisation of the forces with the induction of state of the art technologies and weapons system would continue, he said. The unity and integrity of the country was on top of his government’s agenda, he said.

Exhorting the youth to dedicate at least one year of their precious life for the nation to make it an economic power in the world, Mr Vajpayee announced the launch of a communication satellite 3B within a year with totally indigenous efforts for spreading computer and Internet education. The proposed satellite would have six transponders, he said, adding that it was an era of space development and ""we will not lag behind"".

Congratulating scientists, technologists and armed forces for the recent nuclear tests, the Prime Minister said that it had made every Indian proud. But for few, all have appreciated the effort. The nuclear tests could not have been done overnight, he said, saying that it was the result of long years of efforts. ""Indira Gandhi had laid the foundations 25 years ago and I have tried to erect an edifice on it"", he said.

The Prime Minister said that though some countries had imposed sanctions after the tests, now they had started easing them. There was a better appreciation of India’s security concerns, he said.

Recounting the achievements of 50 years, the Prime Minister said India was proud of being the biggest and functioning democracy of the world. The country remained committed to freedom, national integration, democracy and secularism, he said adding that the participation of minorities in all national endeavours would be ensured. He lamented the behaviour of legislators and parliamentarians in state assemblies and Parliament.

Expressing concern over the prevailing inflation rate and price rise, Mr Vajpayee said the government would initiate steps, including stern action against blackmarketeers and hoarders, to bring down prices.

Announcing a Rs 550-crore scheme for providing free textbooks to girls up to the primary level, the Prime Minister said that two low premium insurance schemes to benefit women would be launched from Divali this year. The schemes — Rajrajeshwari for women and Bhagyashree for girls — could give up to Rs 25,000 on a monthly contribution of Re 1 only, he said.

Mr Vajpayee said that the government was committed to the empowerment of women and hence wanted to bring a legislation providing 33 per cent reservation for them in the Lok Sabha and state assemblies but could not do because of lack of support from the opposition parties.

The Prime Minister said a high-level task force would be constituted soon for suggesting ways to provide one crore jobs annually.

Underlining the importance of population control and literacy for the progress of the country, Mr Vajpayee said that the government would take appropriate steps.

Referring to suicides by farmers in some states, the Prime Minister said insurance schemes would be extended to cover more crops and more areas and announced that a high-level commission would look into various problems of the farming community.

Announcing the doubling of the provision of employment assurance schemes for the areas of Kalahandi, Koraput and Bolangir, Mr Vajpayee expressed grief over the continuing starvation deaths in these areas.

The government was committed to providing equal status to those belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and other backward classes and a body would be set up to ensure that all reserved vacancies were properly filled.

Defending the economic liberalisation policy, the Prime Minister said that it was necessary for India to compete in the world. He said that swadeshi did not mean being a ""frog in the well"". ""We should compete with the world in the economic field. The world is like a small village now and we should compete"", he said.

Stating his government’s resolve to fight corruption, Mr Vajpayee said that he had introduced the Lok Pal Bill with the Prime Minister in its ambit. He said that the special cell to fight corruption in the PMO would be activated.

The Prime Minister made it very clear that his government would not compromise to remain in power. ""I will accept whatever comes to me while doing my duty but I will not beg before anyone"", he said.

Mr Vajpayee said the country was passing through a sensitive phase and it was the duty of all political parties to cooperate.","In his Independence Day address, Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee reaffirmed India's openness to dialogue with Pakistan, expressing a commitment to never use nuclear weapons aggressively.

K. Bezbaruah transferred for which she was blamed and demanded cancellation of transfers of Bezbaruah and 17 other top officials including Revenue Secretary N.K. Singh.

Jayalalitha, who is on a war-path having threatened to review support of the AIADMK and its allies to the BJP-led coalition on the Cauvery issue, alleged that attempts were being made to put the blame on her for the transfers to make her a ""scapegoat to appease some quarters who are anxious to cover some vested interests who are the real culprits behind this whole farcical exercise.""

She demanded re-instatement of Bezbaruah as chief of Enforcement Directorate and cancellation of transfers of all other top officials announced on Friday, including Finance Secretary Montek Singh Ahluwalia saying these were effected ""without the consent"" of Union Minister of State for Personnel Kadambur M.R. Janardhanam, AIADMK nominee in the Ministry.

Jayalalitha said she had written to Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee seeking cancellation of the transfers as these were effected without even Janardhanam being consulted.

She alleged that press barons of a well-known publications group had paid hefty bribes to persons very close to Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee to get Mr Bezbaruah out of the Enforcement Directorate.

""It is no secret that the owners of a well known group of publications have been facing several FERA cases against them. Mr Bezbaruah was pursuing those cases very vigorously and the newspaper barons had to undergo imprisonment repeatedly"", she said.

She alleged that owners of a well known group of publications who had been facing several FERA cases were behind the transfer of Mr Bezbaruah and that these newspaper owners paid hefty bribes to persons close to the Prime Minister to get him transferred.

""They cleverly exploited the present situation to their advantage by making it appear that I had demanded Mr Bezbaruah’s transfer and achieved their objective by pinning the blame on me,"" she charged.

""There are no FERA cases against me. Some of my associates are facing FERA cases, but they are facing them legally in courts. I did not lay down any condition in this regard. My name has been unnecessarily besmirched and I am being blamed in the national media for something with which I am in no way involved"", she said.

The AIADMK supremo reiterated that she did not speak about such matters to Mr George Fernandes and Mr Pramod Mahajan when they met her here. She said she did not broach any subject other than the Cauvery water dispute at the meeting. Even Mr Fernandes himself had stated that no such issues were discussed during the meeting, she added.

Ms Jayalalitha continued to maintain her enigmatic silence on the issue of withdrawing AIADMK front’s support to the Vajpayee government over the Cauvery issue.

Barring a lengthy statement from her today, disclaiming any role in the transfer of Enforcement Director M.K. Bezbaruah and other central government officials, the AIADMK camp showed no ostensible signs of taking any dramatic decision on the withdrawal of support to the government.

The Tribune,1998-08-17 00:00:00,Two corporations replace HSEB,"Power-starved Haryana has given a quite burial to the Haryana State Electricity Board (HSEB) and has instead created two corporations — the Haryana Power Generation Corporation Limited and the Haryana Vidyut Prasar Nigam.

As the name suggests the Haryana Power Generation Corporation (or GENCO as it will be popularly known) will deal with the generation of power while the Haryana Vidyut Prasar Nigam (TRANSCO) will look after the transmission of power. Though it was proposed in the Haryana Electricity Reform Act to create another company, which would be in the joint sector, for present the distribution of power would be under the charge of TRANSCO.

The Chairman of the erstwhile HSEB, Mr Ranjit Issar, has been appointed the Chairman-cum-Managing Director of TRANSCO with Mr P.K. Verma, Member Technical (Operations) of the board; and Mr P.K. Aggarwal, Member Technical (Generation), as the Director (Operation) and Director (Transmission) respectively. Mrs Baljit Bains, Member Finance, will be the Director (Finance).

The Commissioner and Secretary, Power, Haryana, Mr S.Y. Quraishi, IAS, has been appointed as the Chairman of GENCO in addition to his present duties. Mr S.C. Munjhal, Engineer-in-Chief, Operation and Maintenance, Panipat Thermal Plant, has been made the Managing Director of the new corporation, while Mr Narinder Singh, Engineer-in-Chief, Operations, HSEB, Panchkula, will be the director in the rank of Member Technical. Mr Narinder Singh was also holding the charge of Secretary, HSEB.

The first meeting of the Board of Directors of GENCO is scheduled to be held tomorrow afternoon.

There is an interesting story behind the naming of TRANSCO. The Government wanted it to be named as the Haryana Power Transmission Corporation Limited. But this name was already registered with the Registrar of Companies. Hence the corporation's Hindi name was registered.

Initially the division of the employees between the two companies has been done on the basis of ""as is, where is"". However, official sources say this is a provisional arrangement. Anyone affected by it can make a representation which would be considered by a committee which will be formed in due course of time. Legal experts say transfers made in the past couple of years are subject to review.

The sources say a golden hand shake policy was planned for the employees of the board but it was shelved after certain apprehensions were expressed by certain quarters.

The chairman and two members of the Haryana Electricity Regulatory Authority will be sworn in by the Governor, Mr Mahavir Prasad, tomorrow at a function to be held in Raj Bhavan. While a retired bureaucrat, Mr V.S. Ailawadi, will be the Chairman Mr Ramesh Chandra, a former Deputy Comptroller General of India, and Mr R.K. Chander, a Chief Engineer with the Central Electricity Authority, will be Member (Finance) and Member (Technical), respectively.

The companies have been formed to obtain a loan of Rs 2400 crore from the World Bank to reform the power sector.

One wonders if the two companies would be able to do what the HSEB could not do in 30 years or will the companies and the authority provide additional openings to the bureaucrats and technocrats, making the top heavier.","Haryana has dissolved the Haryana State Electricity Board (HSEB) and established two corporations—Haryana Power Generation Corporation (GENCO) for power generation and Haryana Vidyut Prasar Nigam (TRANSCO) for power transmission. While a joint sector company was proposed for distribution, TRANSCO will manage it for now. Former HSEB Chairman Ranjit Issar heads TRANSCO, and S.Y. Quraishi, the Commissioner and Secretary, Power, leads GENCO. The division of employees between the companies is provisional, subject to review. The move aims to secure a World Bank loan of Rs 2400 crore for power sector reforms, prompting questions about their effectiveness compared to the HSEB's three-decade legacy.",Local News,101,519
The Tribune,1998-08-17 00:00:00,"Reinstate Bezbaruah, 17 others: Jaya"," Stepping up her war of attrition against the BJP-led government at the Centre, AIADMK supremo Jayalalitha today alleged that persons very close to the Prime Minister were paid ""hefty bribes"" to get Enforcement Director M. K. Bezbaruah transferred for which she was blamed and demanded cancellation of transfers of Bezbaruah and 17 other top officials including Revenue Secretary N.K. Singh.

Jayalalitha, who is on a war-path having threatened to review support of the AIADMK and its allies to the BJP-led coalition on the Cauvery issue, alleged that attempts were being made to put the blame on her for the transfers to make her a ""scapegoat to appease some quarters who are anxious to cover some vested interests who are the real culprits behind this whole farcical exercise.""

She demanded re-instatement of Bezbaruah as chief of Enforcement Directorate and cancellation of transfers of all other top officials announced on Friday, including Finance Secretary Montek Singh Ahluwalia saying these were effected ""without the consent"" of Union Minister of State for Personnel Kadambur M.R. Janardhanam, AIADMK nominee in the Ministry.

Jayalalitha said she had written to Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee seeking cancellation of the transfers as these were effected without even Janardhanam being consulted.

She alleged that press barons of a well-known publications group had paid hefty bribes to persons very close to Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee to get Mr Bezbaruah out of the Enforcement Directorate.

""It is no secret that the owners of a well known group of publications have been facing several FERA cases against them. Mr Bezbaruah was pursuing those cases very vigorously and the newspaper barons had to undergo imprisonment repeatedly"", she said.

She alleged that owners of a well known group of publications who had been facing several FERA cases were behind the transfer of Mr Bezbaruah and that these newspaper owners paid hefty bribes to persons close to the Prime Minister to get him transferred.

""They cleverly exploited the present situation to their advantage by making it appear that I had demanded Mr Bezbaruah’s transfer and achieved their objective by pinning the blame on me,"" she charged.

""There are no FERA cases against me. Some of my associates are facing FERA cases, but they are facing them legally in courts. I did not lay down any condition in this regard. My name has been unnecessarily besmirched and I am being blamed in the national media for something with which I am in no way involved"", she said.

The AIADMK supremo reiterated that she did not speak about such matters to Mr George Fernandes and Mr Pramod Mahajan when they met her here. She said she did not broach any subject other than the Cauvery water dispute at the meeting. Even Mr Fernandes himself had stated that no such issues were discussed during the meeting, she added.

Stepping up her war of attrition against the BJP-led government at the Centre, Ms Jayalalitha alleged that persons close to the Prime Minister were paid ‘hefty bribes’ to get Mr Bezbaruah transferred, for which she was blamed and demanded cancellation of transfers of Mr Bezbaruah and 17 other top officials.

Ms Jayalalitha, who is on a warpath having threatened to review support of the AIADMK and its allies to the BJP-led coalition on the Cauvery issue, alleged that attempts were being made to put the blame on her for the transfers to make her a ""scapegoat to appease some quarters who are anxious to cover some vested interests who are the real culprits behind this whole farcical exercise.""

Ms Jayalalitha continued to maintain her enigmatic silence on the issue of withdrawing AIADMK front’s support to the Vajpayee government over the Cauvery issue.

Barring a lengthy statement from her today, disclaiming any role in the transfer of Enforcement Director M.K. Bezbaruah and other central government officials, the AIADMK camp showed no ostensible signs of taking any dramatic decision on the withdrawal of support to the government.

With important leaders of her alliance like Mr Vazhapadi Ramamurthy (Tamizhaga Rajiv Congress), Mr Subramanian Swamy (Janata Party) and Mr Vaiko (MDMK) away from the city, there was a lull in political activity.","AIADMK leader Jayalalitha accused close associates of PM Vajpayee of accepting bribes to transfer Enforcement Director M.K. Bezbaruah and demanded the cancellations of transfers. She alleged scapegoating and interference by vested interests. Jayalalitha, amid tensions over the Cauvery issue, denied involvement in the transfers and maintained her silence on withdrawing support to the BJP-led government. With key allies away, political activity subdued. Jayalalitha's statement underscored her resistance against perceived scapegoating and interference, reflecting ongoing tensions within the coalition. The controversy highlights the complexity of political dynamics and allegations of corruption within the government's administrative decisions.",National News,95,688
