Indian Express,2020-06-01 00:00:00,Virus may be invisible enemy but COVID warriors invincible: PM Modi,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi Monday hailed the contribution of medical workers during the coronavirus pandemic. Addressing an event at the Rajiv Gandhi Health University in Bengaluru via video conference, Modi said, “The virus may be an invisible enemy. But our warriors, medical workers are invincible. In the battle of Invisible vs Invincible, our medical workers are sure to win.” He also said that the world is looking at them with gratitude, hope, and seeks both ‘care’ and ‘cure’.

“At the root of India’s brave fight against COVID-19 is the hard work of the medical community and our corona warriors. In fact, doctors and medical workers are like soldiers, but without the soldiers’ uniforms,” he added.
During the address, PM Modi also stressed that violence against COVID warriors will not be tolerated. “I want to state it clearly- violence, abuse and rude behaviour against front-line workers is not acceptable,” he said, during the inauguration of silver jubilee celebrations of Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences.","Prime Minister of India said that the Virus may be an Invisible enemy. but our warriors, medical workers are invincible.

A senior police officer and highly placed sources said 20 people died in the stampede that occurred at 7 pm when platforms no. 5 and 6 were packed with thousands of passengers.

Eyewitnesses said the stampede was triggered when the railing leading to the foot overbridge over platform no. 6 collapsed when several passengers rushed to board a train. They said there was a sudden surge of passengers after an announcement over the public address system about the arrival of a train.
The platform no. 6 was sealed by authorities. There were reports of a lathi charge which compounded the tragedy. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh condoled loss of lives and instructed railway ministry to provide all possible assistance.

The UP government ordered an inquiry and asked the railways to make proper arrangements to clear rush of devotees. Earlier in the day, two pilgrims were killed in a stampede at the Maha Kumbh here as over three crore people converged for a holy dip on the occasion of Mauni Amavasya, the most auspicious day during the 12-yearly congregation.

According to Divisional Railway Manager Harinder Rao, 20 people died and scores were injured in the mishap. The stampede occurred at 7 pm when platform no 5 and 6 were packed with thousands of passengers.
Eyewitnesses said the stampede was triggered when the railing leading to the foot overbridge over platform no 6 collapsed, when hundreds of passengers rushed to board a train. Three hours after the mishap, bodies of 20 victims were lying on the platform.

They said there was a sudden surge of passengers after an announcement over the public address system about the arrival of a train. Platform no 6 was sealed by authorities. Eyewitnesses claimed there was a lathi charge by the police, but Rao said the incident happened when passengers were being told to stand in a line to bring the movement of the crowd under control.
The injured have been rushed to various hospitals. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh condoled loss of lives in the tragedy and instructed ministry of railways to provide all possible assistance.
Singh also directed central government departments to extend all possible help to the Uttar Pradesh government in relief operations.

The stampede was caused after railing of an over bridge at the railway station collapsed. Officials, however, are yet to confirm the death toll.
Akhilesh Yadav announced a committee which will probe into the incident. ""We will investigate whether guidelines for managing the crowd was followed on the big day of Mauni Amavasya Snaan,"" said the state government in a statement. It also added that clear directions were given to local authorities that they should ensure that large number of people do not gather at one place. According to the initial reports, over two lakh people were present at the railway station when the stampede took place.

Over three crore people gathered in Allahabad on Sunday to take a holy dip on the occasion of 'Mauni Amavasya' - considered the most auspicious day during the 12-yearly congregation. ""As per our estimates, three crore people have taken a holy dip till 3 pm. The influx of visitors has slowed down a bit since then but the turn-out has already exceeded our expectations,"" Kumbh Mela Officer Mani Prasad Mishra had said earlier in the day.

Through the day devotees kept surging towards Sangam - the confluence of the holy rivers Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati - while the 13 'akharas' (sects) of sadhus took out their processions for the second 'Shahi Snan' (royal bath) during the Maha Kumbh. Amid chants of 'Har Har Gange', devotees including a fair sprinkling of foreigners, watched awestruck as 'naga sadhus' with their matted hair, ash-smeared naked bodies adorned with garlands of marigold and 'rudraksh' moved in processions with their 'Shri Mahants' and 'Mahamandaleshwars' (seers) perched atop decorated chariots, horses and elephants.

A number of VIPs, including political heavyweights, film stars and business tycoons have visited the Kumbh over the past few weeks. However, the administration had banned any film promotional activity in the Kumbh area to prevent any situation which could lead to a stampede.

The ritual of bathing started on Saturday afternoon itself when 'Mauni Amavasya' began according to the Hindu almanac and reached its crescendo on Sunday morning. A steady stream of devotees was seen at railway stations and bus stations where people from nearby as well as far-off places took to roads and pathways all of which seemed to be leading towards the Sangam on this day. A railway station in the neighbouring district of Pratapgarh was vandalised on Sunday morning by people angry over non-availability of a special train for a trip to the holy Sangam.

Tight security arrangements were in place with more than 15,000 security personnel drawn from central paramilitary forces like ITBP, CRPF, BSF and RAF besides the Uttar Police and its Provincial Armed Constabulary and Anti-Terrorist Squad keeping a close vigil. Besides, the Army conducted aerial surveys every few minutes.","At least 20 people killed and 20 people are injured due to stappled at railway station in Kumbh Mela Uttar Pradesh.

Too often, he remarked, do we judge others by their worst actions and ourselves by our best principles. This double standard, often adopted without due self-awareness of it, is worth a mull-over in various contexts today. In the context of India’s religious diversity and the social dynamics thereof, for example, Mahatma Gandhi’s caution should apply to all public discourse on the issue of Khalistan. Links of this fringe separatist drive with terrorism do have a past record, as New Delhi’s spat with Ottawa reminded us, but care must be taken that the Sikh faith and community are not cast in negative light. Since the risk of this has heightened, all deliberations on separatist violence demand reiteration by our leaders and diplomats, both globally and within India, that Indian statehood is not founded on religious belief. As the language deployed tends to encode signals of inclusion and exclusion, statistically invalid conflations of terror with any group of people must be eschewed. Let principles predominate.","In this article, the author reflects on Mahatma Gandhi's wisdom regarding ""us-versus-them"" thinking and its damaging impact on judgment.

This calls for a spring-back not just from covid, but also from a slump that began about five years ago and led to sub-4% expansion in 2019-20. While a big fiscal and monetary push has been made, we also face the adverse after-effects of relief measures taken globally.

the mint,2022-06-06 00:00:00,Crux of the matter,"
The significance of last week’s speech by Mohan Bhagwat will go up should its call for moderation be heeded across India. As chief of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the ideological mentor of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, he endorsed the value of unity in diversity, as also the validity of various paths of faith, including Islam, and asked for a dial-down of disputes over places of worship to lay out a case for global guruhood based on humanist Hindu ideals aided by state power. A war-torn world, in his view, had made space for a pluralist pax-Sanatana of dharmic truth.

This address of 2 June was significant in our home context of Hindu-Muslim tension not just for its Gyanvapi nudge towards either talks or the law but for sensitivity to the broader flashpoint potential in today’s schism. While its Muslim outreach alluded to an asymmetry of threats, in clarifying that the Sangh was not opposed to non-Hindu forms of devotion, it held out an implicit promise to support freedom of religion. Living up to our Constitution on this crucial point would reduce misgivings and thus also the risk of conch shells being misheard by members of a minority group with little political voice left.","Mohan Bhagwat's recent speech, as the chief of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, holds great significance if his call for moderation is embraced across India.

The Hindu,2023-10-15 00:00:00,"Balancing policy: On Israel, Palestine and India’s line","Within hours of the massacre of Israeli citizens by Hamas fighters last Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted India’s solidarity with Israel. While the histories of their conflicts and the scale of violence have been very different, India has faced terror attacks all too often to not feel the pain in Israel where teenagers at a concert, children in a park, grandparents at home, and even babies in cribs were gunned down, amidst other atrocities Hamas carried out, including taking dozens hostage. The sentiments were repeated when Mr. Modi spoke to Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, condemning terrorism in all its forms. India’s second big concern has been the safety of its citizens, especially as Israel began retaliatory strikes on Gaza. Around 18,000 Indians work or study in Israel, in addition to about 85,000 Israelis of Indian origin (from Maharashtra, Manipur, Mizoram, Kerala, and West Bengal). The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has chartered flights to bring them home. New Delhi has also added nuance to the initial position, with the MEA delivering the government’s first formal statement. While repeating the condemnation of the Hamas attacks, the statement reminded Israel about the “universal obligation to observe international humanitarian law”, as it carries out “global responsibility to fight the menace of terrorism....” In addition, the MEA reiterated its “long-standing and consistent” position on the Palestine issue.

The statement is a reminder of the tightrope India has walked since 1992, when New Delhi established full diplomatic ties with Israel, while continuing to support the Palestinian cause. There has been a shift towards Israel’s position, given increasingly close bilateral relations, trade, technological assistance, military procurement, and counter-terrorism cooperation. In 2017, Mr. Modi became the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Israel, while in 2018, Mr. Netanyahu visited India. However, Mr. Modi was also the first Indian Prime Minister to make an official visit to Palestine. In 2017, India voted against the U.S. and Israel for an attempt to declare unilaterally all of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital. The policy lines New Delhi is continuing to draw seem clear: to abhor terrorism, but not to condone indiscriminate reprisal bombings, even as it holds its consistent position on Palestine. No claim to righting historical grievances can possibly be used by Hamas to explain its inhuman attacks on Israel. However, a responsible state cannot behave like an insurgent group, and Israel’s latest demand, that more than a million Gaza residents must evacuate as it continues to pound the city and plans a possible ground offensive, will make Delhi’s challenge at balancing policy even more complex.","As we Know that from Gaza Patti, Hamas terrorist attacked on Israel with 5 thousand missiles causes this attacked suffered country announced for war.

In the US, prices last month were 8.6% above their year-ago level, an upshoot so sharp that it will probably take a policy-induced recession to get it back down to its target of an average 2%. India’s data for May, released on Monday, puts our retail inflation at 7.04%, down modestly from April’s reading of almost 7.8%. Given our tolerance limit of 6%, it is less disastrous an overshoot than America’s, but that should not serve as a fig leaf for central bank failure.

Talking about a supply shock from overseas as the sole cause of the crisis would be to wilfully ignore the inflationary impulses brought about by an unprecedented monetary and fiscal expansion in response to the covid crisis. As an extended era of cheap oil had no guarantee to begin with, the Ukraine war can at most be blamed for bringing existent risks to a head. Broadly, price stability is a function of the priority we give it. Remember, inflation is the unkindest cut of all, for it acts as a regressive tax. It mostly hurts those who have the least to get by. As it also has its set of gainers, it results in reverse redistribution—from the poor to the rich.

Sri Lanka economic crisis: 10 updates
The island nation of 22 million people is grappling with rolling blackouts for up to 13 hours a day as the government scrambles to secure foreign exchange to pay for fuel imports.

Sri Lanka is currently experiencing its worst economic crisis in history. With long lines for fuel, cooking gas, essentials in short supply and long hours of power cuts the public has been suffering for weeks.

The Sri Lankan government has said it is seeking a bailout from the International Monetary Fund while asking for fresh loans from India and China.

A foreign exchange crunch in Sri Lanka has led to a shortage of essential goods such as fuel and cooking gas. Power cuts that last up to 13 hours a day.

Rajapaksa has defended his government's actions, saying the foreign exchange crisis was not his making and the economic downturn was largely pandemic driven where the island’s tourism revenue and inward remittances waning.

Sri Lanka's currency has been also devalued by almost SLR 90 against the US dollar since March 8.

The latest official data released Friday showed inflation in Colombo hit 18.7 percent in March, the sixth consecutive monthly record. Food prices soared a record 30.1 percent.

Colombo imposed a broad ban on imports in March 2020 in a bid to save foreign currency needed to repay nearly $7.0 billion this year to service its $51 billion debt.

Sri Lanka President Gotabaya Rajapaksa Friday declared a state of emergency giving security forces sweeping powers a day after hundreds of people tried to storm his residence amid an unprecedented economic crisis.

the mint,2022-06-21 00:00:00,How the rupee’s slide will impact India’s economy,"Multiple forces have been pulling the Indian rupee down, including the exit of foreign portfolio investors, the rising cost of international crude oil prices, and a strong dollar. Mint explains the implications of the decline in the Indian currency.
How low can the rupee go?

The rupee was falling till the middle of December 2021 over concerns about the economic fallout from the omicron wave, elevated crude oil prices, and expectations of quicker rate hikes by the US Fed. Subsequently, as covid cases declined, the currency showed signs of appreciation. The rupee came under pressure from late February in the wake of the war in Ukraine and the surge in crude oil prices. On 13 June, the rupee hit an all-time low of 78.29 to the dollar. Market participants expect it to trade in the range of 79-80 to a dollar going ahead, and touching 80 by the end of December.
What is the impact on inflation?

The Reserve Bank of India’s April monetary policy report made the assumption that the rupee will trade around 76 per dollar during FY23, adding that a 5% decline from this would raise inflation by 20 basis points. The rupee has already declined 2% from this assumption, signalling a worsening of inflation ahead. RBI said that given the high volatility in financial and commodity markets, the pass-through of currency weakness to inflation will not be linear and will vary with time. India’s inflation was earlier expected to moderate this year due to RBI’s measures, but the eroding rupee will deny this benefit.
What does a weaker rupee mean for businesses?

One, higher import costs. Second, Indian firms have been borrowing from the offshore dollar market, and the stock of commercial borrowing stood at $226.4 billion at the end of December 2021. Interest repayments are, therefore, expected to swell. Fund-raising through external commercial borrowing is likely to moderate too.
Will current account deficit worsen?

Current account deficit (CAD), or when the imports are more than exports, is expected to worsen. For a net importer like India, a weak currency isn’t good news. This worsens CAD especially at a time of heavy FPI outflows. The CAD could touch 3% of GDP (vs CAD of 1.2% in April-Dec 2021) due to higher import bills and a fall in forex reserves, since it is being used to finance the deficit. Forex reserves stood at $596.45 billion as on 10 June. However, over the next year, reserves could rise if exporters benefit from the cost advantage.
What are the options before RBI?

India’s central bank has been selling dollars from its reserves and buying rupee, which leads to the supply of dollar going up and that of the rupee falling.

At the beginning of October, one dollar was worth a little over ₹74 and it is currently around ₹78. If RBI hadn’t intervened, dollar could have touched ₹80 already. That said, RBI cannot keep selling dollars as its forex reserves will deplete at a faster pace. Since October last year, India’s forex reserves have fallen by around $40 billion.","The Indian rupee has been declining due to several factors, including the exit of foreign portfolio investors, rising international crude oil prices, and a strong US dollar. As a result, the rupee hit an all-time low of 78.29 to the dollar on June 13, and market participants expect it to trade in the range of 79-80 to a dollar, possibly reaching 80 by the end of December.

The impact on inflation is significant, as a weaker rupee is expected to worsen inflation. The Reserve Bank of India assumed that the rupee would trade around 76 per dollar during FY23 and noted that a 5% decline from this level would raise inflation by 20 basis points.

For businesses, a weaker rupee means higher import costs, and Indian firms that have borrowed from the offshore dollar market will face increased interest repayments.

The current account deficit (CAD) is also expected to worsen due to the weak rupee, especially at a time of heavy foreign portfolio investment (FPI) outflows. The CAD could reach 3% of GDP, compared to 1.2% in April-December 2021.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been intervening by selling dollars from its reserves to support the rupee. However, this approach has its limits, as depleting forex reserves at a rapid pace is not sustainable. RBI will need to carefully manage its interventions to stabilize the rupee without depleting its reserves too quickly.

A majority of urban Indians said their cost of living has gone up to some extent as compared to 12 months ago, as prices of daily essentials rose. Among the 1,013 urban respondents polled online during 7-10 June, 46% said their cost of living has gone up “a lot” compared to 12 months ago, while 33% said it has gone up “a little”.

“With inflation at its highest level in the past eight years, petrol prices spiralling and wholesale price inflation at a 30-year high, cost of living in India has gone up in the recent past,” YouGov said.

Retail inflation measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) grew sharply to an eight-year high of 7.79% in April, before cooling to 7.04% in May. As a result, households are trimming expenditure they deem unnecessary.

Consumers in tier I cities are feeling the impact more, with half of them claiming that their cost of living has gone up a lot compared to the 44% and 43% of residents in tier II and III cities.

Clothing tops the list of cutbacks, with more than a third saying they have reduced spends on apparel and accessories. Almost as many (31%) have reduced their spending on hobbies or leisure activities such as going to the cinema.

With the recent rise in fuel prices, 29% claim to have cut expenses on petrol or diesel, while 28% have decreased spending on eating out.

This behaviour is more pronounced in tier I cities than other cities, the survey showed.

Around a quarter have cut down expenses on streaming services, but this is notably higher in tier I cities where 32% have claimed to do so in the last six months.

However, consumers continued to spend on various categories such as essential food items, food deliveries, home broadband subscriptions, insurance, alcohol and tobacco and monthly mobile phone bills.

Fewer cutbacks have been reported on essential food items (12%), broadband subscriptions (15%) and household essentials (18%), perhaps because these are more of a necessity, according to the survey findings.

However, two in five urban Indians expect their household situation to improve in the next 12 months.A third (32%) expect no change and only 17% think it will become worse.

","Urban Indian consumers have reduced their spending on apparel, fuel, and dining out over the past six months due to rising inflation, according to a YouGov survey. A majority of urban Indians feel that their cost of living has increased compared to a year ago, with 46% stating it has gone up significantly and 33% saying it has increased slightly. This rise in the cost of living is attributed to factors like high inflation, soaring petrol prices, and a 30-year high in wholesale price inflation. Consumers in tier I cities are feeling the impact more than those in tier II and III cities. The survey also revealed that spending on essential items like food, insurance, and mobile phone bills has continued, while cutbacks were more prominent in non-essential areas such as clothing and leisure activities. Despite these challenges, a significant number of urban Indians expect their household situation to improve in the next 12 months.",Business and Finance

Take the BRICS business forum that is currently underway. With India-China ties going through a rough patch, it’s hard to say how much this club can achieve. The meeting is taking place in the backdrop of a war in Ukraine, and China’s stand on it seems guided more by its rivalry with the US than closeness with Russia. India has been far better balanced, having maintained independent ties with Russia on the one hand and upheld the value of relations with the US on the other.

New Delhi’s stance will leave Beijing peeved as it tries to rally other countries to its anti-US position. With economic recession risks now staring all in the face, a post-covid recovery may need some policy coordination. Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his BRICS address on Thursday spoke of a similar disposition among its five members towards how the global economy is governed to emphasize the role it could play. Yet, common ground may prove elusive. The founding logic of the five’s dynamism as economies has weakened. And India must stay wary of Chinese dominance.

the mint,2022-06-30 00:00:00,Gig workers and the long road to employee status,"Many countries are pushing digital platform companies employing gig workers to treat them as ‘employees’. Now, India’s federal think tank Niti Aayog has joined the debate, recommending social security policies for such workers. Mint explains.
hat is Niti Aayog’s recommendation?

The think tank has recommended that platforms or startups provide gig workers with more support in the form of pension, provident fund, paid sick leave, and medical and life insurance. It has also recommended creating a social security fund to account for injuries and emergencies. It has also suggested the government create ‘platform initiatives’—along the lines of Startup India— which will carry out a census of gig workers to survey and identify them. It wants this framework to upskill them and help them access loans with generous timelines in case of an emergency, and open credit lines for their own ventures.
Why are these proposals important?

The gig economy is expected to triple in size to 23.5 million workers by 2030, according to Niti Aayog’s estimates. The gig economy, therefore, can potentially alleviate unemployment, and provide opportunities to women and marginalized workers. The federal think tank also feels that the platform economy can lead to greater formalization of work. Nevertheless, there are concerns. The think tank noted that long hours and low earnings could result in exploitative work practices. The recommendations come at a time when gig workers at several platforms have protested against harsh work conditions.
How are gig workers treated in other countries?

Last year, the UK Supreme Court said Uber drivers are entitled to minimum wages and holiday pay. In 2020, the US Congress extended unemployment insurance to gig workers as part of covid relief steps. The US government has recommended classifying some gig workers as  ‘employees’. Recently, a Swiss court ruled that Uber drivers were employees.
Do startups provide any support today?

Most startups provide medical, accidental or life insurance policies, but not provident fund or pension benefits. Some companies offer on-job training and benefits such as loans or scholarships for workers’ children. In some cases, a loyal gig worker, one who has spent years on a platform, may be absorbed as a permanent employee. But that’s rare. A new discussion is doing the rounds—startups contributing towards a common government corpus for workers who have been employed for a minimum amount of time.


","Niti Aayog, India's federal think tank, has recommended that digital platform companies employing gig workers provide them with more support. This includes benefits like pensions, provident funds, paid sick leave, and medical and life insurance. The recommendation also suggests creating a social security fund to address injuries and emergencies. Niti Aayog proposes the establishment of ""platform initiatives"" to identify and upskill gig workers, provide access to loans with generous terms in emergencies, and open credit lines for their entrepreneurial ventures.",Business and Finance

PM Modi also said India’s G20 presidency has been the most ambitious and action-oriented in the history of all the G20 presidencies.


Talking about the new ""geopolitical paras"", Kant tweeted, ""They are a powerful call for Planet, People, Peace and Prosperity in today's world. It demonstrates PM Modi's leadership in today’s world.""

Kant's remarks came in the backdrop of a deadlock among G20 member states, as they disagreed on the wording to describe Russia's war on Ukraine. The G20 member countries ""reached a compromise"" after much deliberation, news agency PTI earlier reported. India circulated a reworked draft of the joint declaration among member states.

Amitabh Kant listed the key features of the New Delhi Declaration: Strong, Sustainable, Balanced, and Inclusive Growth; Accelerating Progress on Sustainable Development Goals; Green Development Pact for a Sustainable Future; Multilateral Institutions for the 21st Century; and Reinvigorating Multilateralism

The declaration also shows concern about human suffering and the adverse impact of wars and conflicts around the world. ""India maintains that all states must refrain from the threat or use of force to seek territorial acquisition against the territorial integrity and sovereignty or political independence of any state,"" the declaration states.

The declaration notes that G20 is not a platform to resolve geopolitical and security issues, but also acknowledges that these issues can have significant consequences for the global economy.

On the other side, Hamas, a key Palestinian faction, has been discouraging civilian evacuations, which is raising concerns for the well-being of Gaza's residents.
Unfortunately, this conflict has already resulted in a tragic toll, with around 1,500 civilian casualties and the destruction of some 7,000 housing units, as reported by Palestinian authorities.

Indian Express,2023-10-10 00:00:00,"Canada enabled Khalistan extremists to use violence, says Indo-Canadian","A prominent Indo-Canadian community member has voiced deep concern over the ""ecosystem"" in Canada that has enabled Khalistan extremists to use violence, threaten and bully those opposing their ""nefarious agendas''.

Amidst the diplomatic standoff between Canada and India over the killing of a pro-Khalistan separatist in Surrey in British Columbia province in June, he cautioned that political appeasement for short-term gains is not in the interest of Canada's future.

""Freedom of expression should be for everyone. We have unfortunately created that kind of ecosystem in Canada where these people are very vocal, very violent, very aggressive, and they don't let anybody.... come out against them. They will bully, they will threaten, they will use every possible illegal means... to counter any sanity,"" he said, adding that Sikhs across the US, Canada and the UK have come out and said that they don't believe or endorse the Khalistan ideology.


""These (are big issues) that worry us as Canadians, in the long-term interest of Canada. We feel worried about the future of our children, about the rifts between communities,"" he said, adding that leaders in government and officials in policy and advocacy should take up those issues for the larger interest of Canada.

India and Canada are embroiled in a diplomatic standoff following allegations by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the Canadian Parliament last month that ""Canadian security agencies have been actively pursuing credible allegations of a potential link between agents of the government of India and the killing"" of Khalistani extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar on Canadian soil on June 18 in British Columbia, a charge angrily rejected by New Delhi as ""absurd"" and ""motivated"".

Malik referred to the bombing of Air India Flight 182 in 1985 and said people and families of victims to date feel they have not got justice.

The Montreal-Delhi Air India 'Kanishka' Flight 182 exploded 45 minutes before it was to have landed at London's Heathrow Airport on June 23, 1985, killing all 329 people on board, most of them Canadians of Indian descent.

The bombing was blamed on Sikh militants in retaliation to the 'Operation Blue Star' to flush out militants from the Golden Temple in 1984.

""As a Canadian, I have no hesitation in admitting that we haven't been able to call out the ideology and people who were responsible for that. We've seen them flourish. We've seen them grow, that ideology has grown, got beyond control. People have suffered. Within (the) Sikh community also, there are people who've suffered because of this ideology. They have not got justice for over 40 years now,"" he said.

""This ideology has been flourishing and growing, with whatever patronage or whatever support. That is not Sikh ideology. That is not what Sikh people believe in,"" he said.

He questioned what prompted Prime Minister Trudeau to conclude within four months in Nijjar's case and noted that there are diplomatic ways for countries to deal with issues behind closed doors.

""It looks to us, as Canadians, it's more like appeasement politics or a political move than anything else,"" he said, adding that the issue should have been dealt with in a different way to ensure the already strained relationship between the two countries due to the matters left unresolved for decades now, is not further spoilt.

Malik added that Canada has been facing challenges, including economic recovery after the Covid-19 pandemic and cost of living. ""We need countries like India, partners like India,"" whose economies are growing, he said. ""It is in our interest as Canada, and as Canadians, to work closely with countries like India, and if there are issues, they need to be resolved in a way that it does not hamper Canadians' chances to get economic benefit from opportunities which India presents today,"" he added.

""Both these countries have a great future. People on both sides are very progressive. They want the relationship to flourish, they want exchanges to take place, students to come here, people come here to set up businesses, people to go (to India) to explore opportunities,"" he said.

With the Lander accomplishing a ‘soft landing’ on the Moon’s south pole, India becomes the only country to have ever done so. A rover, which is a small vehicle that is meant to move around on the Moon’s surface, then came out of the Lander. On August 24, ISRO released a video of how this happened on X.
When Chandrayaan-3 took off for the Moon on July 14, we explained the basics of the mission – how a mission launches into Space, what the Chandrayaan-1 and Chandrayaan-2 missions were, etc. You can click here to read it. Here, we further explain why a ‘soft landing’ was crucial to the mission, what makes landing on the south pole a difficult feat, and what is to happen after the landing.
What is a soft landing, and why did Chandrayaan-3 land on the south pole?
According to ISRO, the mission’s three objectives were to demonstrate a safe and soft landing on the lunar surface, to demonstrate a Rover roving on the Moon and to conduct in-situ scientific experiments.

Soft landing simply means landing at a gentle, controlled speed to not sustain damage to a spacecraft. Amitabha Ghosh, a scientist for NASA’s Rover mission to Mars, explained it in The Indian Express thus: “Imagine a spacecraft hurtling through space, at 10 times the speed of an airplane, having to nearly come to a standstill in order to land gently on the Earth — all in a matter of a few minutes and, more importantly, without any human intervention. This, in a nutshell, is a soft landing.”","The Chandrayaan-3 Lander carried more fuel than Chandrayaan-2. This was done to ensure that the Lander is able to make a last-minute change in its landing site if it needs to.

The Chandrayaan-3 Lander has solar panels on four sides, instead of only two in Chandrayaan-2. This was to ensure that the Lander continued to draw solar power, even if it landed in a wrong direction, or tumbled over. At least one or two of its sides would always be facing the Sun, and remain active.",Science and Technology

The Hindu,2010-10-02 00:00:00,A ray of hope,"The results of a vaccine trial for preventing breast cancer in mice have raised hopes of finding an effective vaccine for use in humans. Breast cancer is one of the biggest killers in several countries. With nearly 100,000 new cases reported every year in India, it has overtaken cervical cancer as the number one cancer afflicting women. The results published online in the journal Nature Medicine (“An autoimmune-mediated strategy for prophylactic breast cancer vaccination,” by Ritika Jaini et al , of Cleveland Clinic, Ohio) show that none of the genetically breast cancer-prone mice vaccinated with a single dose of alpha-lactalbumin protein developed the cancer while those that received a placebo did. Except for a couple of studies, research has shown the significance of using this protein as a potential antigen for breast cancer. Alpha-lactalbumin is normally not present in non-breast human tissues. Hence to be chosen as a preventive vaccine candidate antigen to prime the immune system, the protein should satisfy certain conditions. It should be expressed by a majority of breast tumours at significant levels that allow its detection. Secondly, its production by normal breast cells should be restricted to certain easily traceable situations. In this case, alpha-lactalbumin, a lactation-dependent milk protein, is expressed only by lactating mothers. Also, there appears to be less likelihood of the prophylactic vaccine causing any harm to vaccinated women because, the authors note, the availability of the protein is “insufficient in normal non-lactating tissue.”","Promising results from a mouse trial for a breast cancer vaccine have raised hopes for human use. Breast cancer is a major health concern, particularly in India. The study, published in Nature Medicine, found that mice genetically prone to breast cancer, when vaccinated with alpha-lactalbumin protein, didn't develop the cancer, unlike those given a placebo. The protein, not found in non-breast tissues, meets essential criteria for a preventive vaccine candidate. It's primarily present in lactating mothers, making it unlikely to harm non-lactating women. This development is a significant step in the quest for an effective breast cancer vaccine.",Health and Wellness

For deciding cases questioning constitutional validity, the minimum number of judges shall be seven and the decision should be taken by a majority of two-thirds.

The Plumpang fuel storage station, operated by state-run oil and gas company Pertamina, is near a densely populated area in the Tanah Merah neighborhood in North Jakarta. It supplies 25% of Indonesia's fuel needs.
At least 260 firefighters and 52 fire engines were struggling to contain the blaze in the nearby neighborhood, fire officials said.
Video of the fire broadcast on television showed hundreds of people in the community running in panic while thick plumes of black smoke and orange flames filled the sky and firefighters battled the blaze.
A preliminary investigation showed the fire broke out when a pipeline ruptured during heavy rain, possibly from a lightning strike, said Eko Kristiawan, Pertamina's area manager.
He said the fire would not disrupt the country's fuel supply.
Satriadi Gunawan, who heads Jakarta's fire and rescue department, said people living in the residential area were still being evacuated and were being taken to a nearby village hall and a mosque.
""The fire caused several explosions and quickly spread to residential houses,"" Gunawan said.
He said at least 17 people were dead, including two children, and 50 had been hospitalized, some with severe burns.
Indonesia's minister of state-owned enterprises, Erick Thohir, expressed his condolences to the victims and their families and ordered Pertamina to thoroughly investigate the fire and focus on quickly assisting the community.
""There must be an operational evaluation in the future. I'll continue to monitor this case,"" Thohir said in a video statement.
Friday's fire was the second large blaze at the Plumpang fuel depot. In 2014, a fire engulfed at least 40 nearby houses but no casualties were reported.
Fahmi Radhi, an energy analyst, urged Pertamina and the government to immediately move the depot away from the nearby community settlements.
""Pertamina has been negligent by not using international standard security systems,"" he said in an interview with KOMPAS TV. He said that since the 2014 fire there had been no efforts to put such a system in place and that regular inspections should be conducted to avoid future fires.
""Pertamina's board of directors should be held responsible for this deadly fire by being dismissed immediately,"" Radhi said.
An oil spill in 2018 caused a fire that killed five people and sickened hundreds in the port city of Balikpapan.
Authorities said it came from a broken pipe that Pertamina was using to transfer crude oil.

Chidambaram was able to keep the fiscal deficit for 2012-13 within the target he had set himself because total spending by the government was around ₹ 60,000 crore less than budgeted.
One would have expected him to build on this austerity, even though it was led by curbs on capital spending rather than subsidy cuts. However, in the budget he presented on Thursday, the finance minister has indicated he will increase public spending faster than the underlying economy is expected to grow in nominal terms.
There are no prizes for guessing why we have seen a strategic switch from austerity to profligacy: there is a national election due in 2014.","A noteworthy paradox emerges in the fiscal strategy of Finance Minister P. Chidambaram for the year 2012-13. He managed to keep the fiscal deficit within his set target by underspending government funds by approximately ₹60,000 crore.

However, in the latest budget presentation, the finance minister signaled an intention to increase public spending at a rate faster than the expected nominal economic growth.

""the scare is unfounded."" but scientists in the cess itself, john mathai and s. sidhardhan, have pointed out that the issue had been well studied in china where tremors are part of life. disturbances in groundwater are a sure indication of tectonic activity occurring in the western part of indian plate. this place is spread from gujarat to the southern tip of kerala. increase in pore pressure due to heavy rain in a few hours could be a contributing factor, not a causatory factor, it is argued. ""there is increasing tectonic stress building up from within due to reactivation of pre-existing fault zones,"" asserted mathai. the cess team has, however, explained away the red rain in changanncherry, kottayam and some other districts last week. the brownish red colour of the water was owing to the burst of a meteor, the cess team said after examining the rain water collected from these areas. the scientists, in a press release said, ""based on the analysis of the samples of sediments obtained from changanacherry and the information from the residents, preliminary hypothesis as to the cause of the colour has been derived. a meteor dashed from the west to the east and exploded over changanacherry. this happened at 5.30 am. the burning meteor threw fine dust into the atmosphere that came down as red rain. the total dust throwing out is estimated to be some 1,000 kilograms."" however, the scientists are yet to answer another question that is dogging the the public: what caused the yellow, black rain as was reported from kozhikode and palakkad districts of north kerala.","Well collapses in Kerala and Tamil Nadu have raised concerns, with some fearing another major earthquake similar to Gujarat.

""talk of appointment of teachers, principals, revision of courses... all academic matters get coloured in a political light,"" said an academic council member. the role: the four delhi university teachers' associations are all politically affiliated. while the national democratic teachers' front is affiliated to the bjp, the democratic teachers' front has a leftist leaning. the indian national teachers' congress and the academics for action and development have ties with the congress. student issues invariably get stumped, despite the fact that several independent candidates also make it to the council. ""no group fields more than four to five candidates for the 26 elected seats in the ac,"" duta president and aad chairman s.s. rathi said. the rest of the seats are cornered by independent candidates. the consequences: poor quality of teaching is one of the most obvious outcomes. ""the group in power influencing appointment of teachers is common,"" said ndtf member manoj sinha. dtf vice-president vijendra sharma agreed. ""even meritorious candidates require help from these groups,"" he said. take the instance of an east delhi college. it was alleged that the principal favoured the induction of teachers owing allegiance to a particular group. the issue of the principal's suspension developed into a full-scale war. similar were the cases of two other principals who were accused of financial irregularities. some groups even supported them. the machinations come into play even in the appointment of principals. ""there was a disagreement between the university nominees and other governing body members over the principals' appointment,"" said a teacher representative in a governing body. the two nominees allegedly preferred teachers with a certain ideological orientation. the posts were re-advertised in two of the colleges. it's a telling fact that varsity officials refused to comment on the issue of teachers' politics, terming it 'sensitive'. admitting helplessness in the face of policy towards teaching and non-teaching staff, officials seemed at a loss for words. but the direct impact of politics is felt when classrooms go empty due to strikes. last year's marathon strike lasted 45 days. recently, the teachers threatened to boycott examinations to press their demand to implement a promotional scheme. ""it is self-interest versus student interest which now reflects on the perception of teachers,"" said du registrar k k panda. the teachers, on the other hand, blame their higher-ups. ""according to rules, the academic council meeting should be held every month, but in the past 14 months, only three regular meetings have been held,"" said rekha dayal, an aad member. ""how do we raise issues if meetings are not held?"" she asked. however, there have been occasions where groups have been divided, ostensibly over student interest issues. take the instance of bit/bis courses. the academic council in its meeting held in october decided to downgrade the four-year courses. there were groups which opposed as well as supported the decision. ""this, despite the fact that the courses were being recognised in student interest,"" a teacher said. interestingly, there have been instances where upgradation of courses have suffered due to ideological differences. another conflict began brewing with talks of revising the history course, with some teachers claiming that it was a bid to 'saffronise' the curriculum. ""by and large, teachers have not done enough to alleviate the suffering of students, especially in terms of accountability,"" said sharma. teaching is also about inspiration and acting as a role model, he added. but is there a way out? ""what the teachers can do is participate actively in the university-industry interaction cells. this will not only encourage research, but also increase academic involvement,"" panda said.","In Delhi University, students often find themselves caught in the political crossfire, where teachers, affiliated with various political groups, have moved beyond academics into the realm of politics. The influence of political groups within the academic council is noticeable, affecting matters like teacher appointments and course revisions. The impact of this political interference can be seen in the quality of teaching and frequent strikes that leave classrooms empty. While some groups may claim to act in students' interests, the situation remains complex, with ideological divisions even affecting course upgrades. However, some argue that teachers should focus on active participation in academic activities, like university-industry interaction cells, to improve the educational landscape.",Politics
Farmers unhappy with new land acquisition rates,2001-08-04 00:00:00,Farmers unhappy with new land acquisition rates,"new delhi: the announcement of new land acquisition rates brings farmers a step closer to long-awaited compensations. bawana landowner, ram niwas sehrawat, who has been sitting on a protest dharna outside his village along with dozens of farmers for the past 40 days, says: ""we were protesting to get a compensation of rs 23 lakh per acre for our fertile land. we will end the dharna in two days but there are a number of issues that remain unaddressed."" sehrawat says the farmers should be given either a flat or a plot on the land which has been acquired. he says: ""we are demanding this as farmers often blow-off the money they get as compensation. also, these farmers have been agriculturists for as long as they can remember and cannot take up other professions for a livelihood."" a retired sub-inspector of the delhi police said: ""we want the government to change its policy on acquisition. our land was acquired in 1997 for which we will get paid now. the government merely announces in newspapers that it is acquiring a particular piece of land and does not inform individual owners about the acquisition. even if the land has a ripe crop or vegetables on it, we are not allowed to harvest it. local officials come and level the field along with the crop, the trees and the vegetables."" sujinder singh of khera khurd village, who also sat on the dharna, said: ""the government acquired all the eight acres which our family owned. now that we do not have anything to fall back on, we are scouting for land in bareilly or sonepat."" but not every farmer is as wise. bawana mla surender kumar says: ""i wish the government would teach money management to the farmers. otherwise, they will blow up the hefty compensation in buying white elephants and acquiring cars. i have seen farmers enter into a rat race because of this windfall. also, the government can train them so that they invest their money in another profession or business."" bhagat singh of ghazipur village said: ""this compensation amount is adequate. earlier the farmers were being short-changed. sheila's stand on acquisition is right and jagmohan should not have interfered."" but not all farmers think this way. many bawana farmers feel that the congress has merely implemented a position held by leaders like former deputy prime minister devi lal and delhi mp sahib singh.","The announcement of new land acquisition rates is a positive step for farmers seeking compensation. Ram Niwas Sehrawat, a farmer from Bawana, led a 40-day protest to secure fair compensation. He and others are now advocating for plots or flats on the acquired land instead of a lump sum, as they've been agriculturists for generations. Farmers are also concerned about the government's land acquisition process, where they often lose their crops to field leveling. While some see the compensation as adequate, others suggest financial management training to ensure wise investments. Opinions on the government's position vary among farmers.",Farmmer
Indian Express,2001-08-05 00:00:00,IN BLACK AND WHITE Can NDA survive without Vajpayee?,"as long as the nda is around and he is around, with his faculties in good order, he will head it. vajpayee has been the cementing factor for two reasons. one: for what he is, his experience and his statesmanship. and two: he heads the largest party in the nda whose membership is more than all other nda partners put together. in the three years that he's led the country, he has amply demonstrated his capabilities, and through the initiatives he has taken, he has made himself virtually indispensable. a high watermark was his initiative to hold a dialogue with the pakistan leadership. i believe the agra summit was a landmark achievement in that it paved the way for a future dialogue on a whole lot of issues which need to be resolved. i do not believe that without him this would have been possible. in 1977, in morarji desai's government where i was industry minister and vajpayee was the external affairs minister, he had taken initiatives to create channels of communication between india and pakistan. in a sense, in the area of external relations, the country has never reached a point where we stand today, with good relations with most countries of the world. i am narrating all this to make the point that he was the natural leader when the nda was formed and he continues to hold that position of pre-eminence in the alliance. the trust which various components of the nda have in him also makes him the indispensable leader. this has to do with the rapport he has established with every component of the nda as well as his sensitivities, which make him a kind of father figure. he also has the capacity to take a lot of beating where occasionally some individuals or groups act out of turn. he is a good listener. that makes everyone in the nda repose immense faith in him. i do not agree that he has either been imposed from the top or has failed in cementing differences within the nda. go back to 1967. on a call from ram manohar lohia, parties shed their mutual distrust and came together. even though the communists helped the congress to survive at the centre, a number of non-congress governments came up in the states. but lohia died soon after. deprived of his leadership, and unable to withstand the manipulative pressures of the congress, these coalitions fell apart. but lessons were learnt from the mistakes and seeds of future non-congress governments were sown. the point i am making is that we have evolved. in the aftermath of the jp movement and the emergency, the time was ripe for a non-congress government at the centre. this experiment may have lasted longer if the parties had kept their identities and formed a genuine coalition. but jp used his moral and political authority to forge a single party. also, the way morarji desai was selected by jp and acharya kripalani, bypassing the democratic process, led to the fall of the government. two leaders — as powerful, if not more, than desai — jagjivan ram and chaudhary charan singh, never reconciled to this. mistakes were made, but lessons were also learnt from them. so, many of us who had learnt from earlier mistakes were determined not to repeat them when the nda was formed. a national agenda for governance was formulated, overriding ideological tendencies and sectoral agendas. we have done well in three years and as nda's convenor, i have absolutely no doubt that this government will complete its full term. dissent occurs even in single party governments. it's in the handling that your management skills count. (george fernandes is convenor, nda. he spoke to mahendra ved)","As long as the NDA exists and Atal Bihari Vajpayee remains active and in good health, he will continue to lead it. Vajpayee has been the unifying force for two crucial reasons: his experience and statesmanship, and the fact that he leads the largest party in the NDA, which has more members than all other NDA partners combined.

During his three years as the country's leader, Vajpayee has demonstrated his capabilities and taken initiatives that have made him virtually irreplaceable. A significant milestone was his effort to initiate a dialogue with Pakistan, notably through the Agra summit, which paved the way for future discussions on a range of issues. His leadership and rapport with NDA components make him indispensable, akin to a father figure. He can withstand challenges and is known for being a good listener, which fosters trust among NDA members.

It is incorrect to claim that he was imposed from the top or has failed to address differences within the NDA. The political landscape has evolved, and lessons have been learned from past experiments in forming non-Congress governments. The NDA was created with a national agenda for governance, transcending ideological differences and sectoral interests. Despite occasional dissent, the NDA government is expected to complete its full term.

Indian Express,2006-02-03 00:00:00,IIM-B runs into second Hurdle,"BANGALORE: There's a new hurdle the Indian Institute of Management-Bangalore has to clear before going global: the Karnataka government.
With the Union HRD minister Arjun Singh giving the go-ahead for IIMs to set up campuses abroad after amending the Memorandum of Association (MoA), the IIM-B will have to get necessary approvals from the state government to make necessary amendments.
Reason? IIM-B is registered under the Mysore Societies Registered under the Mysore Societies Registration Act XVII of 1960
An amendment in its memorandum can be done only by a general body meeting, which will then have to be approved by the Centre and the respective state government.
..The Centre and the state govt are members of the IIM-B Society.
The Karnataka government had granted 100 acres of land for the IIM-B campus on Bannerghatta Road. Three officials representing various departments of the state government are members of the IIM-B Society. The Bangalore University V-C is also a member of the general body.
As per the existing rules, the IIM-B Board of Governors with the approval of the Centre has to submit a proposition to amend the MoA in a written/ printed form and convene a special general body meeting for the purpose.
Members have to be informed of the meeting at least 21 days before the GBM by registered post.
Once the proposition gets a majority vote, another special general meeting has to be convened by the Board after 30 days from the previous meeting. ""Since the state government is part of the Society, its approval is necessary.""
Apart from amending the MoA, we will frame our own by-laws so that we don't have to go back to the government for everything,"" Shyamal Roy, dean (academic), IIM-B, said.

","The Indian Institute of Management-Bangalore (IIM-B) wants to expand internationally, but the Karnataka government has created a new obstacle. To make this happen, the IIM-B needs to change some of its rules. However, because it is registered under a specific law in Karnataka, any changes need approval from both the central government and the state government. The Karnataka government has given land for the IIM-B campus, and its officials are part of the decision-making group. This means their agreement is essential. The IIM-B is working on making its own rules, so they don't have to ask the government for permission every time they want to make a change.",Local News

Indian Express,2010-01-17 00:00:00,Date or place of birth will not be part of UID,"BANGALORE: Whatever else the Unique ID might have, it shouldn’t have these — date and place of birth and your native state/district. All children too will get a UID number.
These are among the guidelines laid down by the Demographic Data Standards and Verification Procedure (DDSVP) committee headed by former Central Vigilance Commission chairman N Vittal in its report to the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI). This to ensure demographic data is captured in a standardized manner so that the identity information works across all systems. ‘‘The date/place of birth/ residence and other attributes should not be embedded in the UID number. When state/ district IDs are embedded, the number faces the risk of becoming invalid and misleading the authenticator when people move place to place. It can also lead to profiling or targeting based on region, state or a district from where the person hails. There can be centralized database management systems which can index the records for rapid search and access without having to section data by location or date of birth,’’ the committee said in its report, a copy of which is available with TOI.The Centre set up UIDAI and appointed Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani as chairman with a mandate to issue a unique identification number to all Indians. UID for children: The committee said all children will be assigned a number. ‘‘Since children’s fingerprints are not fully formed, during enrolment, details of the parents should be captured to link the child to established UIDs so that either of the parents can be used to authenticate the child.’’ Interestingly, the committee said when the child’s biometrics are well-formed, biometrics will be captured and the child will be de-duplicated to ensure the uniqueness of the child. Leverage mobiles: Given the rapid penetration of mobile phones and landlines across the country and across economic groups, the phone could become an enabling device used to authenticate a person, especially in villages where internet penetration is still low. Introducer concept: Coming to the aid of lakhs of Indians, specially the poor who don’t have any supporting documents to prove their identity, the committee told UIDAI to start an ‘introducer’ system where those Indians with a valid UID can validate these persons.","The Demographic Data Standards and Verification Procedure (DDSVP) committee, led by former Central Vigilance Commission chairman N Vittal, has issued guidelines for the Unique Identification (UID) project in India. The committee recommended that the UID should not include date and place of birth, as this could lead to issues when people move, profiling, or pointing based on their place of origin. It also stressed that children should receive a UID, linking them to their parents initially and capturing their biometrics once fully formed. The use of mobile phones for authentication and the introduction of an 'introducer' system for identity validation were suggested.

Indian Express,2010-01-17 00:00:00,Railways sets date with petitioner opposing Kashmir-link project,"NEW DELHI: Cornered by judicial intervention, the Railway Board has invited a PIL petitioner to make a presentation on the safety risks that have remained despite the apparent improvements decided by it in August in the ambitious project of linking the Kashmir valley with the rest of the country. Following an order passed last month by the Delhi high court to review its decision on the Kashmir-link project, the board asked the counsel for Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL), Prashant Bhushan, to present his viewpoint to it on January 19. The board has been forced to hold this special meeting with Bhushan even after he had, in a letter dated January 8, accused two of its members, Rakesh Chopra and Shri Prakash, of suppressing the safety risks inherent in the “slope skirting alignment” advocated by them. In his PIL, Bhushan also pointed out that Chopra, member engineering, had undone the corrective action initiated by his predecessor S K Vij in 2008 of scrapping the much-touted plan to build the world’s tallest arch bridge on Chenab and thereby paving the way for adopting a straighter and shorter alignment based on the modern technology of tunneling through mountains. Vij’s corrective action was based on the proposal of switching from the slope-skirting alignment to a straighter and shorter alignment as the latter was designed to reduce exposure of the railway line to land-slides in the geologically fragile Himalayan mountains from Katra to Banihal in the Jammu region. Since the focus of the PIL is on the deficiencies of its August decision to retain the slope-skirting alignment, the board will be hard pressed to justify its failure to implement the assurance given by railway minister Mamata Banerjee in her Budget speech two months earlier that the “foremost concern” of the review of the Kashmir-link project would be “the safety of the passengers”. The PIL has accused the board of working against the interests of the nation by overlooking the “fundamental flaws in the alignment” which prevented the project from progressing more than 10% in seven years. Though the project was due to be completed in 2007, all that has been opened so far is the section in the flat terrain of the Kashmir valley while making little headway in dealing the engineering challenge of crossing the Himalayan barrier.
According to the PIL, Chopra went out of his way to persuade the board to retain the flawed alignment because he had been involved in its planning and execution in the crucial first four years of the project.","The Railway Board has found itself compelled to address safety concerns regarding the Kashmir valley connectivity project due to judicial intervention and a Public Interest Litigation (PIL). A Delhi High Court order prompted the board to invite the petitioner, Prashant Bhushan from the Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL), to present his safety-related viewpoints on the project. Bhushan had previously accused two board members, Rakesh Chopra and Shri Prakash, of concealing safety risks associated with their preferred ""slope skirting alignment."" Bhushan's PIL emphasized the need for a straighter, shorter alignment to mitigate landslide risks in the Himalayan terrain, as initially proposed by S.K. Vij in 2008 but later reversed by Chopra. The PIL criticized the board for failing to address fundamental alignment issues, causing significant delays in the project's completion. The Railway Board now faces scrutiny over its decision to retain the contentious alignment, despite earlier assurances regarding passenger safety made by Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee. The PIL argues that the board's actions have hindered the project's progress, which was originally scheduled for completion in 2007. While a portion of the project in the Kashmir valley has been completed, challenges associated with crossing the Himalayan terrain remain largely unresolved. The PIL contends that Chopra's involvement in the project's planning and execution during its initial stages influenced the board's decision to maintain the problematic alignment. The board must address these concerns in response to judicial directives.

The university normally conducts the convocation and awards degrees to the graduates latest by November every year. However, there is no word on the convocation for the 2008-09 batch of students, although it is the fag end of January now. ""Many of our students who graduated in the previous batch keep calling us to find out if we have any news about the convocation. We are unable to answer them. Our staff had approached the university but the authorities merely informed them that the convocation could not be scheduled due to some technical reasons,"" said a principal of a leading self-financing engineering college in Kancheepuram district. The scene was more or less similar in many other colleges too. ""The delay is intriguing. I find no reason for not conducting the convocation,"" observed a dean of a college. Students, particularly, tho-se who have gone abroad for higher studies are the worst hit as some universities there insist that they furnish the degree certificate at the earliest for verification. ""Although I had produced the provisional certificate and the consolidated marksheet for the four-year study period, the university officials are insisting on the convocation certificate since most Indian students receive it by December,"" said Balakumar, who is pursuing an MBA programme in a US university. Inquiries with senior professors of the Anna University revealed that the event was being delayed as the office of the governor-chancellor has not yet given the mandatory date for conducting the convocation. ""As per rules, the date for the convocation can be finalised only with the consent of the chancellor of the university. Only after getting this date can the university go ahead and print the 70,000-odd graduation certificates, which have to be then manually signed by the controller of examinations or the registrar.

We don't know if Raj Bhavan officials are upset over something or if the university has failed to toe their line on some issue,"" a senior professor and syndicate member of the university told Times of India.

Of the 90 Assembly seats, the Congress won 68 in 2018 and the BJP won 15. After several bypolls, the Congress’s tally is 71 present and the BJP’s is down to 13.

Of the 14 heavyweights whose candidature have been declared are Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel (Patan), Deputy CM T S Singh Deo (Ambikapur), Speaker Charan Das Mahant (Sakti), and Cabinet ministers Amarjeet Bhagat (Sitapur-ST), Umesh Patel (Kharsia), Jai Singh Agarwal (Korba), Shivkumar Dahariya (Arang-SC), Anila Bhendia (Dondi Lohara-ST), Tamradhwaj Sahu (Durg Rural), Ravindra Choubey (Saja), Guru Rudra Kumar (Nawagarh-SC), Mohammad Akbar (Kawardha), Mohan Markam (Kondagaon) and Kawasi Lakhma (Konta).
There are some big names among the eight MLAs denied tickets. In Kanker, former IAS officer Shishupal Shori has been replaced by former MLA Shankar Dhruv while in Dantewada the party has replaced Devati Karma, the wife of Mahendra Karma who had started the Salwa Judum anti-Naxal militia, with their son Chavindra. Maoists killed Mahendra and several senior Congress leaders in the 2013 Jhiram Ghati attack in Sukma. Devati won the 2013 election but lost to the BJP’s Bhima Mandavi five years later. But after Mandavi was killed in a 2019 Naxal attack, Devati won the ensuing bypoll against Mandavi’s wife.","The Congress on Sunday declared its first list of 30 candidates in Chhattisgarh, including 19 of the 20 constituencies at stake in the first phase on November 7.

The Virat Kohli vs Sourav Ganguly feud was out in the open for public consumption after India's most successful Test captain was sacked from ODIs. Although Kohli had given up T20I captaincy, he was keen to continue in one-dayers hoping to win the World Cup at home. But Ganguly and BCCI had other plans, and Kohli eventually succumbed, his thoughts not aligning with the board's.

With India fresh off a World Cup elimination, the baton passed to Rohit Sharma. He was expected to give India what Kohli couldn't – an ICC silverware – but pretty soon, even the most successful IPL captain realised that leading India is far more challenging than Mumbai Indians. Rohit and Rahul Dravid were given a team Kohli and Ravi Shastri nearly raised from scratch, so when most of them went absent due to injuries, India were not ready for the repercussions – such as failing to qualify for last year's Asia Cup final and a defeat to Bangladesh which no one saw coming.

When Kohli left, Mohammed Siraj was giving Ishant Sharma stiff competition as India's third pacer in Tests, Kuldeep Yadav was away in the wilderness and Jasprit Bumrah was fatigued. Two years down the line, all three of their fortunes have swung the entire arc. Siraj is the world's No. 1 ODI bowler, Kuldeep is this year's second-highest wicket-taker and Bumrah is even more menacing than before. India at their full strength can ransack oppositions at will, and after a testing year-long-wait, Rohit is finally at a space where he can enjoy this luxury. But he wouldn't have been in this position had he not played a role in nourishing the emotionally-damaged, mentally-wrecked Kuldeep and making a full-of-promise Siraj realise his ODI pedigree."," The Virat Kohli vs Sourav Ganguly feud was out in the open for public consumption after India's most successful Test captain was sacked from ODIs  Although Kohli had given up T20I captaincy, he was keen to continue in one-dayers hoping to win the World Cup at home.

Financial Express,2014-11-01 00:00:00,Black money: ‘Supreme Court needs to be on same page for better global cooperation’,"Amidst various countries raising concerns over co-operating and sharing confidential taxpayer information with the Indian government in the wake of the Centre handing them over to the Supreme Court, an official said that the move was necessitated ?in order to bring the judiciary on the same plank as the government? so that they can continue to receive co-operation from other countries.
Stating that the government took a measured risk, the official said that it ?asked the Supreme Court to reconsider its interpretation so that the judiciary is on the same plane as the executive at the international fora and that further co-operation is obtained without any problems of interpretation of treaties.?
The official said that there is difference in interpretation of confidentiality clause (meaning of ?public court proceeding?) by the Supreme Court and how they are interpreted internationally. While the SC interprets that information received from foreign countries can be used in hearings too, the international interpretation of confidentiality clause is, ?information received from countries can only be used for tax purposes and tax assessment/enforcement?, said the official.
He further said that if the SC?s interpretation of the confidentiality clause remains different from the international interpretation then ?there may be delays in signing the Inter-Governmental Agreement with the US for automatic exchange of information?.","The Indian government wants the Supreme Court and the government to agree on how they handle confidential taxpayer information. This is important because other countries are worried about sharing this kind of information with India. The government wants both sides to understand the rules the same way, so they can work together smoothly with other countries. Right now, there's a difference in how the Supreme Court and the international community interpret the rules. The government wants them to see it the same way to avoid problems, especially with agreements like the one with the US about sharing tax information.",Business and Finance

Market speculation of a special dividend also propped up the stock.
Analysts said the company announces a special dividend every four-five years. Before the lockdown, the company had revised its dividend policy — increasing its payout to 80-85 per cent of earnings for FY20 from 56 per cent in FY19.According to reports, the company, which has cigarette manufacturing plants acoss Kolkata, Munger, Saharanpur, Ranjangaon and Bengaluru, has resumed production and distribution.“Cigarette factories are now functional.

The implied PE (FY21 basis) for the cigarettes business is 7 times — lower than  even most global tobacco stocks,” said JM Financial in its report.","ITC's shares witnessed a 7.5% surge to Rs 188.90 due to attractive valuations and optimism surrounding the resumption of cigarette production. ITC holds a significant share in India's tobacco industry, and market rumors of a special dividend also contributed to the stock's rise. The company traditionally announces special dividends every four to five years, and prior to the lockdown, it revised its dividend policy to increase payouts to 80-85% of earnings for FY20. Reports indicate that ITC has resumed cigarette production and distribution, which has led to increased investor interest.

The Tribune,1998-07-30 00:00:00,Punjab cuts power tariff hike,"In a politically tactical move, the Punjab Government today considerably reduced the power tariff, which had been enhanced by 33 per cent, across the board, on July 20.

The Chief Minister, Mr Parkash Singh Badal, who announced the revised tariff, said this had been done after obtaining the views of business, trade and industry, whose representatives met him here on July 27.

Instead of across the board reduction in the tariff, there would now be variation in the power rates for different categories of consumers. But on an average, the ""revised"" but ""lowered"" tariff comes to about 16 per cent hike against 33 per cent earlier.

The new tariff comes into effect with immediate effect; today itself.With this concession to consumers, the revenue of the Punjab State Electricity Board (PSEB) will be reduced to Rs 425 crore from the envisaged Rs 900 crore, which would have accrued to the board from the 33 per cent uniform hike. The junior partner, the BJP, however, will have a talking point in its urban political constituencies vis-a-vis the Congress by saying it had sided with the trade.

Mr Parkash Singh reiterated that ""free"" power to the agriculture sector would continue. It was not being used to compensate the PSEB by cross-subsiding the same by effecting hike in the power tariff in respect of other categories of consumers.

The PSEB, it was explained by the Chairman, Mr S.K. Tuteja, had taken a loan of Rs 3,400 crore from the government, which resulted in payment of Rs 457 crore annually by way of interest, which the PSEB owes to the government. A sum of Rs 300 crore, which the PSEB loses on ""free"" power to the farm sector was, thus, adjusted from the interest money to be paid.

Another important decision announced by Mr Parkash Singh was on constitution of a ""tariff regulatory authority"".

The PSEB had been directed to ""economise"" to the extent of 3 per cent of its expenses, subject to a minimum of Rs 100 crore during 1998-99. Mr Tuteja pointed out that 3 per cent economy would be effected by tightening administrative and financial controls, besides, ensuring there were no ""overdrawals"" of power.

The PSEB, the Chief Minister said, would not make any fresh appointments in any category of employees.

Mr Tuteja said postings and transfers were already banned. The same order would be strictly adhered to.

The BJP minister, Mr Balramji Das Tandon, was also present at the press briefing called at short notice at the Chief Minister's residence. He expressed his ""satisfaction"" over the revised hike: ""If industry is happy, so are we"". Both Mr Tandon and Mr Parkash Singh denied any differences between the coalition partners on the power tariff issues.

When a correspondent remarked that the CPI was agitated over the power hike, Mr Parkash Singh retorted by saying ""Should we introduce the power tariff prevailing in West Bengal."" The PSEB chairman, read out the comparative rates between Punjab and West Bengal. He stressed that Punjab still had the lowest power tariff in the country.",The chief minister of Punjab reduces the price of power which were earlier hiked by 33 percent. Now there will be difference in power price for different consumers. Overall there is 16% hike as compared to before 33% hike. This will immediately come into effect from today itself.,National News

The Economic Times ,2022-10-22 00:00:00,"Bumrah can't be replaced, but Arshdeep can deliver the same results with a different approach","Arshdeep Singh was the first Indian player to walk out to the nets in India’s optional training session at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, two days before their match against Pakistan.For India and Indians, the Pakistan clash is the pinnacle, still, despite genuine aspirations of going all the way.Arshdeep is the most inexperienced player in India’s squad, with only 13 T20 Internationals under his belt. He has not played 50-over cricket for India and has not even come close to selection for the Test squad.Going forward a little more, Arshdeep has played only six first-class matches and 17 List-A (or domestic 50-over matches) so far.And yet, he is a gun bowler.There is no reason to believe Arshdeep cannot do well in other formats, but there is enough evidence to show that he is a T20 gem.At 1.9m height, he brings a vertical element that is challenging, in that he can hit a slightly shorter length and still get the ball to kick and surprise batsmen.Wiry and sinewy, Arshdeep can bang the ball in on a length, to contain, if that’s what the situation and conditions demand.But, most crucially, he is a banker in the death overs. Arshdeep has a yorker that he can control and, for now, bowl almost at will.This has been India’s biggest challenge — the death overs— and there is no indication that it has been solved.Bhuvneshwar Kumar is a fine swing bowler up front, but his 19th over stats in T20 cricket recently make for sad reading. Mohammad Shami, back in the team despite not figuring in this format for a year, was a bit of a wild card. Shami nailed his yorkers, bowling just one over, the final one, in a practice match, but that was a time and place when there was no pressure.With Jasprit Bumrah out of action, India are short of options at the death. Hardik Pandya bowled himself at all times when taking the Gujarat Titans to the Indian Premier League title, but he has not yet been trialled as a death bowling option by India.In a World Cup, teams will be flexible about their playing XI. Rishabh Pant one day and Dinesh Karthik another, depending on whether you want to be top heavy or finisher ready.But when it comes to bowling the final few overs, either the 18th and 20th or the 17th and 19th, you need to be very clear.In T20 matches, whether defending a total or chasing, these are critical overs that decide the game.Make or break.In comes Arshdeep. He sets his mark far, far away, runs in from well outside the 30-yard circle, but his mind is engaged in the last few strides when he extends his left arm and lets the ball go.
Arshdeep’s yorkers are usually yorkers. They do not end up as full tosses that get smacked.Arshdeep, while being young and inexperienced, thinks like a T20 bowler. He has variations, but does not use them for fun.In many ways, Arshdeep is a return to cricket as it was once played. After all, what ball from a quick bowler is more lethal than a yorker? A bouncer might send you to hospital, but if you can’t keep the toe-crusher out, you’re gone and so is your team.India’s challenge in this World Cup is death bowling.At the top of the innings, you’ve got Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul and Virat Kohli, who have all seen the light and are approaching this format for fun, with skills. Suryakumar Yadav is a stunner who has taken T20 batting to another playful and unexpected level.In the spin department you have Yuzvendra Chahal, an IPL stud, R Ashwin, all-time great, and Axar Patel, a gun replacement for Ravindra Jadeja.There are riches galore in this Indian squad, no doubt. But, when it comes to picking the final eleven, there will be tricky choices. But, Arshdeep must be the first name on the team list after Jasprit Bumrah was ruled out.The strong arm of Bumrah, his punchy shoulder and sinewy back, cannot be replaced. But, Arshdeep can deliver the same results, with a completely different approach.
","Arshdeep Singh, despite his relative inexperience, stands out as a T20 gem in India's cricket squad. His strength lies in his effectiveness during the death overs, an area where India has struggled. Arshdeep's skillful yorkers make him a reliable choice for these crucial overs, which often determine the outcome of T20 matches. Unlike some other bowlers, Arshdeep consistently delivers accurate yorkers, showcasing a thoughtful and methodical approach. With the absence of Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep becomes a key figure in addressing India's death bowling challenges. While Bumrah's unique style cannot be replicated, Arshdeep offers a different yet effective approach to the game. This makes him a vital asset in India's T20 World Cup campaign.",Sports

This discharge is the body’s natural way of cleaning itself. You just have to be alert, if you notice something unusual in this discharge seek help from your doctor immediately to avoid infections. Keep your vagina clean: If you notice that your discharge is too heavy, then you need not wash it too frequently. Washing too frequently can lead to irritation and further cause infection. Hence, prefer wiping it with a clean tissue instead of washing it abruptly. Always wipe your vaginal area, from the front to the back, with a clean tissue after using a toilet. Wiping the other way can lead to bacteria transfer from the anus to the vagina. Here are some must-do tips for better vaginal health

Indian Express,2012-03-10 00:00:00,India defers decision on ‘cotton ban’,"India will keep a controversial ban on its cotton exports for now after ministers failed to agree its fate on Friday, even after top buyer China had criticized the move, which boosted global prices. Indian exporters, who have some 2.5 million bales outstanding for overseas sales, are left with the limited consolation of shifting a maximum of 500,000 bales that have already been cleared by customs. The meeting was inconclusive. Further discussion is needed. The next meeting will be held as soon as possible, Kiran Dhingra, the top civil servant at the textile ministry, told reporters. India, the world’s second-biggest cotton producer, unexpectedly banned exports on Monday after a record 9.5 million bales had been shipped since Oct. 1,saying it wanted to ensure adequate supplies for domestic textile mills. Traders said delaying the decision on the ban would unsettle global markets. It will lead to uncertainty, and we could see volatility in prices in the coming days, said Ghanshyam Ladha, a trader based in the western city of Jaipur. China’s cotton industry association also had said the ban was irresponsible and would disrupt the global market. Farm Minister Sharad Pawar, a key ally for the ruling Congress party and an influential voice in previous export decisions, demanded the ban be lifted because it hurt cotton farmers, saying he had been kept in the dark about the move. PARTIAL RELIEF- The commerce ministry earlier on Friday said it would allow cotton cleared by customs before March 4 to be exported, giving some relief to stretched traders, even though 2 million bales remain in limbo – registered for export but not shipped. What the government has done will trim the inventory by a very small amount. It is not a significant price booster, said Pradeep Jain, a trader based in Jalgaon, in western Maharashtra state. Government sources have said India may decide to allow limited exports of cotton above this to cover existing sales commitments and avoid defaults or costly foreign replacements. The benchmark New York cotton future on ICE was down 1.06 percent at 88.61 cents per lb by 1418 GMT, largely reacting to U.S. Agriculture Department monthly supply and demand data. Spot prices for Shanker-6 cotton on India’s domestic market rose 500 rupees per candy to 33,500 rupees as the ban continued. The key March cotton contract on India’s Multi Commodity Exchange closed broadly flat before the meeting at 16,860 rupees per bale of 170 kg. Cotton ended 2011 as the worst-performing commodity of the year, falling 37 percent from 2010 after record prices had boosted output and decimated demand, while a shaky global economy scared off investors. If India’s ban persists, major cotton exporter Australia is poised to benefit the most, analysts said. India’s official export total … has already exceeded the country’s exportable surplus, analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a research note. This bodes poorly for U.S. export demand for the balance of the season. Globally, cotton production is expected to exceed consumption this year and again in 2012/13 despite low prices, according to the International Cotton Advisory Committee. Morgan Stanley said that if the ban continued, it could have a negative impact on Indian domestic prices and planting prospects next year.","India has decided to maintain its controversial ban on cotton exports, despite opposition from China and concerns about its impact on global prices. The ban, unexpectedly imposed after India had shipped 9.5 million bales of cotton since October 1, aims to secure adequate supplies for domestic textile mills. This move left Indian exporters with only limited options, allowing them to shift a maximum of 500,000 bales that had already cleared customs. The delay in the decision regarding the ban has unsettled global cotton markets, causing uncertainty and potential price volatility. India is the world's second-largest cotton producer, and the ban's continuation may benefit major cotton exporter Australia. The ban's persistence could also negatively impact Indian domestic prices and planting prospects for the following year.",Business and Finance

The Statesman,2023-10-15 00:00:00,"In Israel’s ground assault plan, a clear goal on Hamas, uncertainty over Gaza city","The Israeli military is in the final stages of its preparations for a full-scale, coordinated ground, air and sea assault on Gaza and tens of thousands of its troops have already massed near the border of Hamas-controlled region. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF), according to a New York Times report, have been given clear orders to capture the Gaza city and destroy the current leadership of the Palestinian Islamic militant group Hamas.

According to the unclassified details of Israel’s ground assault plan as outlined by three senior Israeli military officials, the main goal of the mission will be to wipe out the top political and military leadership of Hamas, a Palestinian militant group that controls Gaza.

However, the report said, the military officials were uncertain what Israel will do with the Gaza city if they capture it. The officials also didn’t elaborate what they meant by destruction of Hamas’s military and political leadership.The Israeli military has officially confirmed they are preparing for a coordinated ground, air and sea attack on Gaza. However, some experts believe that if Israel captures the Gaza city, it may remain there for some time to ensure the vast underground tunnel network of Hamas is fully destroyed and restore order.

There are some speculations that Israel may consider giving the control of Gaza to Fatah, which dominates the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and rules in the West Bank. However, there appears no sign of it so far, let alone any official word.Both Hamas and Fatah are political rivals to each other in the Palestinian political scene. While Hamas followed armed resistance against Israel, Fatah has chosen negotiations over violence.

The officials acknowledged the war against Hamas risks Israel locking into months of “bloody urban combat, both above ground and in a warren of tunnels”. The assault would be Israel’s biggest ground operation since 2006 when it invaded Lebanon and the first since 2008 Gaza conflict.

Israel declared a war against Hamas and vowed to wipe it off the face of the Earth after its militants led a massive terrorist attack on Israel last week that killed more than 1,300 people, including women, children, elderly, and soldiers.

The IDF has warned nearly 1.1 million Gazans to flee their homes in the north and evacuate to safer areas south of the Wadi Gaza. The Israeli military Saturday gave them a 24-hour deadline to leave and extended it by three more hours on Sunday even as the UN warned of “devastating humanitarian consequences”.","The Israeli military defended the mass evacuation orders, saying its war is against Hamas and not the Gazans civilians and that it was giving them a chance to save themselves and their family members.The officials acknowledged the war against Hamas risks Israel locking into months of “bloody urban combat, both above ground and in a warren of tunnels”.

The sangai Express,2023-10-15 00:00:00, 2 village volunteers hurt as Kuki militants launch heavy attack,"By Our Staff Reporter
IMPHAL, Oct 12: Two village volunteers sustained splinter and bullet injuries in a fierce attack by Kuki militants while as many as nine Meira Paibis suffered injuries of varying degrees as they were lathi-charged by army and paramilitary forces in Yaingangpokpi and Seijang area, Imphal East this afternoon.
Kuki militants have been attacking Meitei villages located in the periphery of Lamlai Assembly Constituency and Saikul Assembly Constituency since the last couple of weeks.


Even though Meitei families of these villages stay at their homes during daytime, women and children have been taking refuge at safer places during night in view of the sporadic firing by Kuki militants.
Two days back, Kuki militants attacked Sabung-khok Khunou, Yaingang- pokpi Shantikhongbal, Thamnapokpi, Sanasabi and other adjoining Meitei villages by firing innumerable rounds from multiple directions.        
They intensified their attack early this morning using bombs and sophisticated weapons.
At around 3.10 am, Kuki militants from Twichin Kuki village and Monomphai village came up to a brick-field located in between Sabungkhok Khunou and Twichin Kuki village and opened indiscriminate fire toward Sabungkhok Khunou.
State security personnel, BSF and village volunteers who are stationed in the area in view of the present unrest in the State retaliated.
Notwithstanding the presence of Central security forces in the area, Kuki militants continued firing toward the Meitei village till 9 am although there was a gap for a few minutes.


The Kuki militants ceased firing at around 9 am only to resume it with more intensity at around 1 pm.
 In their bid to push back the Kuki militants, the village volunteers and security forces fired several rounds of bullets in retaliation.
During the gunfight, one village volunteer sustained a splinter injury on his right buttock.
He is presently undergoing treatment at Raj Medicity and his condition is said to be stable.
Another village volunteer also sustained bullet injury on his lower chin. He has been admitted to Little Clinic for treatment.
An ambulance which rushed in to evacuate the injured village volunteers was stopped by the army at Sabungkhok Khunou.
Immediately, the local Meira Paibis intervened and urged the army troops to give passage to the ambulance.
Although there was a brief stand-off, the army troops finally allowed the ambulance to move ahead and evacuate the injured victims.
However, the army personnel snatched the mobile phone of a reporter from Impact TV News who was covering the incident. They gave back the mobile phone after deleting all the photographs of the stand-off.
Meanwhile, heated arguments broke out between army, paramilitary forces and Meira Paibis who were on the road at Yaingang-pokpi, Sabung-khok, Sabungkhok Khunou and Seijang village.
To disperse the Meira Paibis who were on the road, army and paramilitary forces first used smoke bombs and stun grenades and but later the army and paramilitary forces lathi-charged the womenfolk, inflicting injuries to as many as nine Meira Paibis.
They were evacuated to CHC Sawombung and Raj Medicity for treatment.
Out of the nine Meira Paibis, four admitted to Raj Medicity have been identified as Nepram Thabatombi (48) of Nongada Shantipur, Taorem Meme (41), Nameirakpam Nanao (46) and Pebam Basanti (45), all from Seijang Awang Leikai
The situation is still very tense in the area.
DIG Range-I  N Herojit and other senior officers of Imphal East District Police and commando personnel are presently stationed in the area.
On the other hand, according to an unconfirmed report, five weapons were reportedly seized by paramilitary forces from village volunteers

The space agency said Vikram Lander has been set into sleep mode around 8 am Monday. Payloads have been switched off while lander receivers are kept on.
Before going into sleep mode, in-situ experiments by ChaSTE, RAMBHA-LP and ILSA payloads on lander were performed at the new location. The data collected was received at the Earth.

ISRO sources said that the payloads and ramp of the lander were folded back before performing the hop test.

Further, it was elevated by firing its engines and making it hop once on the lunar surface.

""On command it (Vikram lander) fired the engines, elevated itself by about 40 cm as expected and landed safely at a distance of 30 to 40 cm away,"" ISRO said in an update on 'X'.


""Vikram soft-landed on the moon, again! Vikram Lander exceeded its mission objectives,"" ISRO added.

After the successful hop test, Vikram and Pragyan payloads are now in a power-off mode until the south pole of the lunar surface is back in the range of the Sun again.

ISRO said that Vikram will fall asleep next to Pragyan once the solar power is depleted and the battery is drained. The space agency said it was ""hoping for their (Vikram and Pragyan's) awakening, around September 22, 2023.""

Scientists at ISRO said that after the Chandrayaan 3 mission landed on the lunar surface on August 23, Vikram and Pragyan performed all their planned experiments within one lunar day or approximately 14 earth days and finally after a hop test, have been put on sleep mode.

THE Hindu ,2021-10-01 00:00:00,Dangerous precedent: On Sikkim CM's disqualification,"The Election Commission (EC)’s order reducing the period of Sikkim Chief Minister Prem Singh Tamang’s disqualification from electoral contest is morally wrong and a dangerous precedent that may end up reversing the trend towards decriminalising politics. Under Section 11 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, the EC indeed has the power to remove or reduce the disqualification attached to a conviction. However, this has been used rarely, and seldom in a case involving a conviction for corruption. Mr. Tamang was convicted under the Prevention of Corruption Act for misappropriating ₹9.50 lakh in the purchase of milch cows for distribution in 1996-97. His one-year prison term was upheld by the High Court and the Supreme Court. He went to jail and was released on August 10, 2018. He was controversially — and in brazen disregard of the Supreme Court’s 2001 ruling in the case of late Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa — appointed Chief Minister by the Sikkim Governor earlier this year. Mr. Tamang did not contest, but was elected legislature party leader by the Sikkim Krantikari Morcha (SKM), which won the election. His appointment as Chief Minister was challenged in the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, he approached the EC for removing his disqualification. His main argument was that the law prevailing at the time of his offence entailed disqualification only if the sentence was for a term of two years or more; and that the amendment in 2003, under which any conviction under the anti-corruption law would attract the six-year disqualification norm, should not be applied to him.Disqualification from contest is a civil disability created by electoral law to keep those convicted by criminal courts from entering elected offices. It is not a second punishment in a criminal sense. Mr. Tamang cannot argue that disqualification for a one-year term amounts to being given a punishment not prevalent at the time of the offence. The EC decision also goes against the grain of a series of legislative and judicial measures to strengthen the legal framework against corruption in recent years. The apex court has described corruption as a serious malady and one impinging on the economy. In 2013, the protection given to sitting legislators from immediate disqualification was removed. Further, common sense would suggest that disqualification should be more strictly applied to those convicted for corruption. Legislators handle public funds, and there is good reason to keep out those guilty of misusing them. Mr. Tamang, even by virtue of the order reducing his disqualification to one-year-and-a-month, was not eligible to be sworn in, as his disqualification continued till September 10. Yet, he is now eligible to contest a byelection and retain his post. The EC is already battling a perception that its actions are partisan. Its order in favour of Mr. Tamang, coming just a day after the BJP struck an alliance with the SKM for bypolls to be held on October 21, is bound to further strain its credibility.","The Election Commission (EC) has reduced the disqualification period for Sikkim Chief Minister Prem Singh Tamang from electoral contest, a move that could potentially reverse the trend towards decriminalising politics.

The SlS Plant was inaugurated by Tata Steel vice-president (raw materials) Rajeev Singhal.

Singhal said as a responsible corporate, Tata Steel is undertaking several such initiatives that contributed towards sustainability of the environment.

The SlS Plant, besides conserving water, would prevent water from sludge pits percolating into ground and contaminating groundwater, the statement said.

Installed at a cost of nearly Rs 8 crore at FAP, Joda, the SlS Plant is an environment-friendly initiative, set to recover manganese-rich solid from the wet gas cleaning plant slurry.
Water recovered by the processing of GCP slurry will be fully recycled, leading to water conservation to the tune of 15 cubic metre per hour.
Also, the recovery of manganese-rich solids makes it possible to recycle the same, for production of Ferro Manganese. It helps conserve valuable high-grade manganese ore and use lower grade of Fe-rich manganese ore. Manganese-rich solid cakes from the new SlS Plant will be used for production of ferro manganese after suitable agglomeration.
FAP-Joda, set up in 1958 with an installed capacity 36 KMT, presently produces 50 KMT of High Carbon Ferro Manganese per annum.
Among others, Tata Steel Ferro Alloys and Minerals Division (FAMD) executive in-charge MC Thomas and Tata Steel general manager, Operations, FAMD RR Satpathy were present.",Country's first SIS pant was launched by Tata Steel for Gas Cleaning Plant at FAP at Joda by Tata steel vice president Rajeev Singhal.

Admitted to a London hospital in 1972 when he was doing his Masters, he saw the heart-wrenching sight of a toddler undergoing a painful catheterization - and invasive procedure -- to determine an oxygen leak in the heart. I didn''t like hospitals and I don''t like children crying. That was the day I decided to work on non-invasive diagnostic tools and techniques,"" Dr Mohapatra told TNN in an interview on Monday, hours after he had been penciled in as the next CEO of the $4.5 billion Quest Diagnostics Incorporated, the world''s leading provider of medical diagnostics.The change-over, announced by outgoing CEO Kenneth Freeman, will see Mohapatra take charge next May of a company ranked 391 in the Fortune 500. He will be one of the very few India-born top executives of Fortune 500 company, an honour he says he never really expected when he began life as one of seven children of an Orissa government employee. It all began, he says, when Mohapatra Sr. returned to India after a MS in public health engineering from Johns Hopkins University in 1949. He was a contemporary of Susheela Nayar and he wanted to return to India and work on providing clean water to the people. The Family learning pedigree and commitment ethos saw the first three Mohapatra siblings achieve academic excellence - one of his brothers is a senior scientist at Orissa''s Rice Research Institute and another is a mathematics professor at Central Florida University. Following a masters in medical electronics and a doctorate in medical physics from London, Surya Mohapatra joined Leigh Instruments, a firm that specialized in making avionics black boxes. It was the kind of company where if they made three perfect black boxes out of 100 (97 were discarded), everyone was happy because failure is not an option in such instrumentation, he says. That gave him the grounding in standards. Expertise in cardiac pacemakers, defibrillators and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) followed. By the time he had worked his way through Britain''s GEC and Picker International (now part of Phillips), he had a host of papers and patents that marked him to be one of the top authorities in non-invasive cardiovascular tools and techniques. He joined Quest in 1999 and went on to become its President and Chief Operating Officer before the board of directors made him the CEO-designate. In his time at Quest, the company has turned around from touch near junk bond status to creating a $6 billion shareholder value. It has gone on to become America''s leading provider of diagnostics, serving approximately half of the physicians and hospitals in the US, performing more than a million tests every business day. ""It is an exciting time in an exciting field because today 70 per cent of medical decisions are based on diagnostics,"" says Mohapatra. ""In times to come I believe knowledge of our genetic pre-disposition combined with diagnostic images will change the way we live."" Mohapatra believes medical diagnostics is still very scattered and disorganized in India, although it has improved in recent times. Quest, he says, has no plans just yet for India because the company is at the moment focused very much on the US and ""business models that work in the US may not work in India.""","Surya Mohapatra, an electrical engineering graduate, unexpectedly rose to become the CEO of Quest Diagnostics, a Fortune 500 company specializing in medical diagnostics.

The Mint,2013-02-28 00:00:00,The paradox in Chidambaram’s budget,"Here is a paradox worth paying attention to. Finance minister P. Chidambaram was able to keep the fiscal deficit for 2012-13 within the target he had set himself because total spending by the government was around ₹ 60,000 crore less than budgeted. One would have expected him to build on this austerity, even though it was led by curbs on capital spending rather than subsidy cuts. However, in the budget he presented on Thursday, the finance minister has indicated he will increase public spending faster than the underlying economy is expected to grow in nominal terms. There are no prizes for guessing why we have seen a strategic switch from austerity to profligacy: there is a national election due in 2014. The good news is that Chidambaram has promised a sharp increase in development spending while bringing down the subsidy bill as a percentage of the gross national product, by around 0.6 percentage points. The budgeted increase in the food subsidy bill is also modest given the fact that the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) is banking on the proposed food security Act as a vote catcher. The committee of fiscal consolidation headed by Vijay Kelkar had quite correctly pointed out in its report that subsidies pose the greatest risk to fiscal fitness.

The big question that hangs over the latest Chidambaram budget is how the surge in spending will be financed in an economy that has lost momentum, especially if the promise of a further reduction in the fiscal deficit is indeed to be met. The budget is on wobbly ground here. The assumption that tax revenues will be up by a fifth is a brave one, but even more questionable is the fact that the finance minister has budgeted for a massive 32.79% increase in non-tax revenue, including a very ambitious ₹ 55,814 crore disinvestment programme.


It seems that the arithmetic depends on two factors: the ability of the government to control subsidies and the success of the proposed disinvestments. Together, these are worth 1.1% of gross domestic product (GDP). I also think the 28.39% increase in Plan expenditure will act as a sort of buffer for Chidambaram in case his revenue assumptions go awry. Plan expenditure can easily be sacrificed at the altar of fiscal prudence, a tactic that most finance ministers have used in the past two decades.

Besides the coming general election, Budget 2013 was also framed for an economy trapped in a host of structural problems that were analysed with welcome candour in the Economic Survey released on Wednesday. Growth is down to its lowest level in a decade, inflation is still too high, the record current account deficit exposes the Indian economy to global shocks, private sector investment has collapsed, the national savings rate is dropping and households are putting their money in gold rather than the financial system.","In the 2012-13 fiscal year, Finance Minister P. Chidambaram managed to keep the fiscal deficit within his target by spending approximately ₹60,000 crore less than budgeted, primarily through restrictions on capital spending rather than subsidy cuts. However, in the latest budget, he plans to increase public spending faster than the expected nominal economic growth. This shift from austerity to increased spending is driven by the upcoming 2014 national election. The positive aspect is a boost in development spending and a reduction in subsidies as a percentage of the gross national product by around 0.6 percentage points, though the food subsidy increase is modest despite banking on the proposed food security Act as a vote-catcher. Fiscal fitness is still threatened by subsidies, as highlighted by the Vijay Kelkar-led fiscal consolidation committee",Politics

""IB inputs indicate that terrorists may use a small aircraft or chopper to strike at the busy Mumbai airport. Though the threat is specific to the Mumbai airport, the Centre has also alerted neighboring Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Goa as terror elements may take off in small planes from unmanned airstrips or less-used helipads in these states to access the Mumbai airport,"" a senior CISF official told ET.
The alert does not identify the source of the threat. It is also not time-specific. However, security agencies are taking no chances, given the recent bomb blasts in Mumbai and Delhi, and have heightened the security arrangements at the Mumbai airport as well as at airstrips and helipads across Maharashtra and its neighbouring states.
In general, security has been beefed up at the airport, with the Central Industrial Security Force, Bureau of Civil Aviation Security and the Mumbai Police in charge of security. Flight operations are normal,"" an airport spokesperson told news agencies in Mumbai.
The Intelligence Bureau alert, sent to the five states on September 9, asked state police and agencies to keep an eye on those hiring small private aircraft or choppers as well as agencies leasing them.
Vigilance has been advised at unmanned airstrips and less-used commercial helipads in the states concerned to prevent terrorists from using them to take off in small planes to hit the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport. The Mumbai Police and CISF have been asked to step up surveillance at all access points to the Mumbai airport.

The court martial looked into the extra-judicial killing of five people after a unit of the Punjab Regiment picked them up along with four others from different places in Tinsukia between February 17-19 in 1994. Those found guilty are Major General A K Lal, Colonels Thomas Mathew and R S Sibiren and JCOs and NCOs Dilip Singh, Jagdeo Singh, Albindar Singh and Shivendar Singh. “It is a welcome judgment. The judgment will strengthen people’s faith in judiciary and the Army,” Sonowal told PTI. He said the verdict, which was delivered Saturday, will be a deterrent to people in authority not to engage in unlawful acts and to behave responsibly and in a fair manner. The verdict will give solace to the families of the victims, who were innocent students and youths, the chief minister added. The summary general court martial, held at the 2 Infantry Mountain Division at Dinjan in Dibrugarh district of Assam, held the seven army personnel guilty and sentenced them to life imprisonment. Sonowal said the judgement is a reflection of India’s democratic values where human rights and fairness are respected. “The Army has also worked in a fair manner without any prejudice,” he said. During the 1994 fake encounter at Dangori in Tinsukia district of Assam, Sonowal was president of the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) and had sought an impartial probe into the case. “The long wait of the families for justice has come to an end and I hope the higher authorities will uphold the judgement,” he said.

Indian Express,2003-11-23 00:00:00,Nepal links: A question mark,"The CBI headquarters may have sought the intervention of the Nepal government to seek custody of Madhumani on grounds of reports that she was being sheltered by two MPs of the Himalayan kingdom, but is Madhumani still on the other side of Mount Everest? Well, the CBI is yet to establish this.
Sources said that the CBI had clues about Madhumani being in safe heavens of Nepal and hence sought the help of the Nepal government and the Royal Nepal police to extradite her.

But the premier investigative agency was now working on possibilities that she might have sneaked back into India and be very much present in UP itself.

As there was no extradition treaty with Nepal, a memorandum of understanding (MoU) was the only pact between India and Nepal on deportation of their respective citizens at the request of the parent nation. Here, neither lengthy formalities of deportation through extradition are required, nor is it mandatory for any country to hand back the people.
The same problem emerged when a dozen of Maoist rebels were traced in UP, undergoing treatment at various private nursing homes for injuries suffered during their ongoing war with the Nepal government.
After a pact between the two countries was signed, they were simply handed over to the Royal Nepal Police at the borders. Sources said that this simple exchange of outlaws was one mode which would facilitate the return of Madhumani, More so because the CBI in India is the nodal agency which co-ordinates with the Interpol for across the border investigations and as Madhumani was wanted by the CBI itself, there was not much that was to be done to get her back.
But then, is Madhumani still in Nepal or she was there when the CBI collected the proof of her availability at the houses of the two MPs and, thereafter had returned to India? This is one question which the CBI says was worth more than a million dollars.","The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has been attempting to secure the custody of Madhumani, who is believed to be in Nepal with potential shelter from two MPs. However, the CBI is still uncertain about her current location. They initially sought Nepal's assistance for her extradition but are now considering the possibility that she might have returned to India, specifically Uttar Pradesh. Since there is no extradition treaty between India and Nepal, an MOU facilitates the deportation of individuals at the request of their home country. This process was previously used when Maoist rebels were found in Uttar Pradesh, leading to their handover to the Royal Nepal Police at the border. The CBI, being the coordinating agency with Interpol for cross-border investigations, is working towards bringing Madhumani back. However, the question of her current whereabouts remains a significant concern for the CBI.",National News

The Economic Times,2020-04-25 00:00:00,Infectious diseases experts divided over May 3 lockdown exit ,"Mumbai: As India approaches the May 3 deadline for lifting the nationwide lockdown, top epidemiologists are divided over the future course of Covid-19 management and the strategy to be followed in getting the country back to work.
Two veteran infectious diseases experts — Jayaprakash Muliyal and T Jacob John, who were at the forefront of the leprosy eradication and pulse polio immunisation programmes, respectively — feel it’s time to end the lockdown, with one of them describing a long-term shutdown as akin to ‘burning the house to kill a rat’.
Experts from the official health establishment, however, advocate phased relief, with strict containment measures guided by surveillance mechanisms. They warn that achieving ‘herd immunity’ is a costly proposition that will result in a surge of positive cases, which will overwhelm the healthcare system.My advice is: Keep the elderly out of the picture for the time being, as the disease hurts them the most. So, we quarantine the old for two-three months and let the youngsters get to work,” Muliyal told ET.
“Several of them will fall ill, unfortunately, but there will be adequate space in hospitals to treat them. So, mortality can be further reduced. And then, we reach the point of saturation, or herd immunity,” he added.
Act of Stopping Time: T Jacob John
Muliyal has been a big proponent of the ‘herd immunity’ concept. This is a strategy where you let natural immunisation take place by a large population contracting the disease, thereby halting the spread of the infection.
This controversial concept was initially promoted by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, before the country reversed its stance on the issue. Recent random antibody testing in New York reveals that 20% of that city’s population may have contracted Covid-19 and recovered on its own.
According to Muliyal, herd immunity may already be developing in India as reports come in of people with sub-clinical and mildly clinical symptoms. “Along with epidemic, the natural immunisation process is also going on… all I am saying is, don’t forget that,” he said, adding the country needs to worry about availability of beds in hospitals. This disease seems to spare the young, as mortality rates in that segment are very low, Muliyal said.
John described the lockdown as an act of stopping time. “It just froze time. Once you unfreeze time, whatever you stopped day before the lockdown, it will pick up. So, lockdown is not simply for reducing the transmission or flattening the curve, it is because you need time to prepare. And if you didn’t prepare in two weeks, you won’t be prepared in four weeks either,” he told ET.
John compared the lockdown effort for hunting the virus to the story of a ‘clever man’, who burnt down a house to kill a rat. “The lockdown was good for two weeks, three weeks was the upper limit. Anything more than that will be like burning the house down,” he said.
At the other end of the spectrum, two experts who are part of the National Task Force of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said the country needs to get used to a new normal.
The best post-lockdown strategy is to implement phased relief, with stricter containment measures guided by strong surveillance mechanisms. Herd immunity as a concept is mostly theoretical at this stage since reinfections are known to exist in communities that have had the infection earlier,” said Giridhara Babu, an infectious diseases expert with the Public Health Foundation of India.
""I think the lockdown has been successful in keeping the burden low, helping in preparedness and scaling up testing. It has proven most models predicting a worse scenario wrong,” said Sanjay Pujari, director of the Institute of Infectious Diseases.
Pujari said herd immunity may be a good concept for infections with low morbidity and fatality rates. But in case of Covid-19, trying to achieve herd immunity will lead to a surge in cases which will overwhelm health systems.
","Some experts believe it's time to end the lockdown, saying it's like burning the house down to kill a rat. They suggest quarantining the elderly and letting the young go back to work. They think natural immunity might already be happening. Others say we should have a gradual return to normal with strong surveillance. They caution against relying on herd immunity, as it could lead to too many cases. The lockdown has helped prepare and scale up testing. So, while opinions differ, it's important to stay cautious.",Health and Wellness
Hindustan Times,2023-06-12 00:00:00,Article 370 pleas will be heard day-to-day,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday said it would begin day-to-day hearings from August 2 on a clutch of petitions pertaining to the nullification of Article 370 of the Constitution, and recorded a statement by the Union government that it will not rely upon the contents of an affidavit filed a day ago to bring on record the scenario in Jammu & Kashmir since the move.

Observing that the challenge to the abrogation of Article 370 — which conferred special status on J&K until August 2019 — is a “pure question of constitutional validity”, a five-judge bench, comprising Chief Justice of India Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Sanjiv Khanna, BR Gavai and Surya Kant, set down the matter for an extensive hearing in the first week of August. It asked all parties to submit the documents they want to rely upon by July 27.

“The learned Solicitor General has submitted that though the Centre has filed an additional affidavit setting out the central government’s views on post-notification developments, it would have no bearing on the constitutional question involved in the matter and hence, it would not be relied upon,” said the bench in its order.

Defending the nullification of Article 370 of the Constitution, the Centre on Monday filed an affidavit to state that the August 5-6, 2019 decision has led to “unprecedented development, progress, security and stability” in J&K, adding that “life has returned to normalcy in the region after three decades of turmoil”. It further said that the nullification has resulted in dismantling of the terror network, and incidents of stone pelting and street violence have “now become a thing of the past” in J&K where all the provision of the Constitution and central laws now apply uniformly.

However, on Tuesday, the bench pointed out that the Centre’s endeavour to portray the situation in J&K after the abrogation is likely to prompt the other side to file their own version of the state of affairs.

“Our apprehension is that you present a post-notification scenario and then they (opposite side) may file another affidavit to cite their version of the post-notification scenario. Even otherwise, that affidavit has no bearing on the questions of the constitutional challenge in these petitions,” the bench told the SG Tushar Mehta, who agreed to undertake that the Centre will not be harping on the contents of the affidavit.

The Constitution bench further ordered that the batch of matters relating to Article 370 and bifurcation of the state into two Union territories will be now listed as “In Re: Article 370 of the Constitution”.

During the brief hearing specifying the procedural directions, the court also allowed requests of bureaucrat Shah Faesal and former student leader Shehla Rashid to withdraw as petitioners challenging the abrogation of Article 370. Faesal resigned from service in protest in 2019 to float a political party in J&K. However, his resignation was not accepted by the government, and he withdrew it later. Faesal’s decision to withdraw the petition came soon after he was taken back into the Indian Administrative Service in April 2022 and was appointed deputy secretary in the Union ministry of culture. In his plea filed on April 29, 2022, Faesal told the court that he does not wish to be part of a petition questioning the Centre’s decision to end the special status of J&K since he wishes to pursue public service without the baggage of political activism.

In its order, the bench clarified that the hearing of the matter will proceed on a day-to-day basis, barring Monday and Friday when the court hears miscellaneous and fresh cases. Advocates Kanu Agrawal and Prasanna V will be the nodal counsel for the preparation of common convenience compilations, said the court, adding pleadings in the matter must complete by July 27.

A raft of petitions, filed by parliamentarians from the National Conference party, Kashmiri citizens, former bureaucrats and various organisations laid the challenge to the abrogation of Article 370 soon after the presidential order in August 2019.

While some petitioners brought up the requirement of consent from the constituent assembly for abrogation of Article 370, others questioned the validity of the President’s rule that was in effect when the abrogation was made. A few of these pleas went back to the Instrument of Accession, while some highlighted the Supreme Court’s ruling of 2018 that observed that Article 370 had gained a status of permanence.

Many petitions have also challenged the Jammu and Kashmir State Reorganisation Act, by which the state was split into two Union territories with effect from October 30, 2019.

On August 28, 2019, the Supreme Court issued notices on the pleas despite resistance from the central government, which argued that Article 370 had international and cross-border implications. The Centre had at that time argued that it was a sensitive matter and whatever happens in the country over it would be brought up at the United Nations. While issuing notices, the court referred the matter to a five-judge Constitution bench.

The matter was last listed in March 2020, when a five-judge bench declined to refer the matter to a larger bench of seven judges. The reference was sought on grounds that two previous judgments of the apex court were conflicting with each other, but the bench did not agree with this contention.

At that time, it was noticed by the bench that there was also an older batch of petitions pending in the Supreme Court that challenged the validity of Articles 370 and 35A, which accorded special status to J&K. It pointed out that all the matters related to Article 370 should preferably be heard together.","The Supreme Court of India has announced that it will commence day-to-day hearings on August 2 regarding various petitions challenging the abrogation of Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which granted special status to the region of Jammu and Kashmir until August 2019. A five-judge bench, led by Chief Justice Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, emphasized that the matter revolves around the constitutional validity of the abrogation. The government stated it would not rely on the contents of an affidavit filed the previous day to explain the developments in Jammu and Kashmir since the move.

The Center had defended the nullification of Article 370, claiming it had brought significant development, security, and stability to the region, and that incidents of violence had significantly decreased. However, the court expressed concerns that presenting the post-abrogation scenario might lead to opposing parties filing their own versions.

The petitions, filed by various individuals and organizations, raise questions about the necessity of consent from the constituent assembly, the validity of the President's rule during the abrogation, the Instrument of Accession, and the status of Article 370. Some also challenge the Jammu and Kashmir State Reorganization Act, which divided the state into two Union territories.

The hearing will proceed day-to-day except for Mondays and Fridays, with preparations to complete by July 27. This legal battle has significant implications for the future of Jammu and Kashmir's constitutional status.",legal proceedings

The Economic Times,2013-07-27 00:00:00,Congress indicates movement towards formation of Telangana,"NEW DELHI: The Congress is likely to take the final call early next week on the demand to carve a separate state of Telangana in Andhra Pradesh, after its central leadership held several rounds of discussions on the long-pending issue with various stakeholders on Friday.
The process of consultation is over. The time has come to take a decision. The Congress and UPA would take a decision soon and we will let the people know,"" said Digvijaya Singh, Congress general secretary in charge of Andhra Pradesh, soon after a meeting of the party's core group at the prime minister's residence in the evening.
The Congress Working Committee is likely to put its stamp on the final decision at its meeting early next week, a party leader told ET.
While the decision on the demand for statehood has been hanging fire for several years, the party is now also facing pressure from the united Andhra or Seemandhra camp within its state unit. This camp has got the impression from the central leadership that the Congress will soon announce its decision to carve out a separate state, a person familiar with the matter said. The Seemandhra leaders have therefore made a beeline for New Delhi in a bid to stall the decision.
At the core group meeting, Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh consulted an array of leaders on the issue that has split the party along regional lines in the state. Besides Digvijaya Singh, these included Gandhi's political secretary Ahmed Patel, home minister Sushil Kumar Shinde, finance minister P Chidambaram, defence minister AK Antony and the party's former in-charge in the state Ghulam Nabi Azad.
Earlier in the day, Digvijaya Singh held several rounds of meetings with senior leaders including Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Kirankumar Reddy, state unit chief Botsa Satyanarayana and deputy chief minister Damodar Rajanarasimha.
The party's Cabinet ministers, state ministers and state leaders favouring a united state met at Andhra Bhawan to convey to the leadership their strong opposition to statehood for Telangana.
The meeting was attended by Union ministers KS Rao, MM Pallam Raju, JD Seelam and Chiranjeevi. Senior MPs KVP Ramachandra Rao, L Rajagopal and V Arun Kumar were also present. The group decided to put pressure from all quarters to impress on the high command that the decision to bifurcate the state would not augur well for the party's electoral prospects.
S Sailajanth, the state minister heading this group, told the media after the meeting that they were confident the state would remain united. He dismissed as speculation the talk of a likely decision to carve out Telangana state. ""We have decided to exhaust all options to ensure the state remains united,"" he said.

The talks are expected to focus on the divided Himalayan region of Kashmir and on Islamist terrorism, the two issues that have most troubled the feuding neighbours since they launched a dialogue in January 2004
The meeting comes a day after an Indian army soldier died in shooting across the military ceasefire line dividing Kashmir, which is split between the two countries and claimed in full by both.
Indian foreign secretary Shivshankar Menon- the country's top foreign ministry bureaucrat - met Pakistani counterpart Salman Bashir for a review of the four rounds of talks held over the past four years, a photographer witnessed.
Foreign ministry officials also confirmed the talks had started. Their meeting will prepare the ground for talks between Indian foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee and his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mehmood Qureshi on Wednesday, a Pakistani foreign ministry statement said.
""The review meetings will help the two sides to assess the progress made in the fourth round of the eight segments of composite dialogue process and deliberate on how to address the outstanding issues in a more meaningful way,"" it said.
Pakistan also announced that it would release 96 jailed Indian fishermen and three civilians on Saturday ""as a gesture of goodwill"" to mark the Indian minister's visit, a Pakistan interior ministry statement said.

Cinestar and former TDP MP Jaya Prada joined the Samajwadi Party at its convention here in Yadav's presence.

Addressing the convention of party workers and office-bearers, the SP chief was unscathing in his criticism of the BJP and BSP, dubbing them as one. He was equally critical of the rift in the 31 district units of the party in the state and called upon workers to iron out differences so that SP could fulfil its target of winning 60 seats from UP.

During his stay in India, Swami Chidanandaji was interviewed on matters of import affecting different strata of society and the world. Here are some excerpts:
Q: Swamiji, would you have any tips for the youth to achieve real success?
Swami Chidanandaji: “First of all, realise that I have a body, I have a mind but I am the atman — a soul. Real success means organising one's life and one’s goals by giving the right amount of time for each of those. You can’t ignore the material, and you can’t ignore the intellectual development and educational development and you certainly cannot ignore the development of spiritual consciousness. 
  “Real success comes from adopting a way of life that gives time to each one of those. That is exactly what you find in the Yogoda Satsanga Lessons. The whole road map for balanced living: for the health of the body, the efficiency of the mind, in education and cultivation of the intellect and the rational qualities is all very important.
  “And learning to meditate and take a little time. 10 minutes may be in the morning and 10 minutes in the evening. (That's not really fair in a way because once they do it for 10 minutes, they will want to do it for 20 minutes, and once they do 20 minutes, they would want to do it longer…that's how meditation works!) 
  “But the point is…to be successful you have to build a plan for life…nobody is going to be successful by waiting for it to happen. You have to structure the 24 hours we each have in a day. You have to look at that and consciously take control of your time and consciously use your time for the aspirations that you have.”",President and spiritual head of yogoda satsanga society swami chidanadan giri visited india and gave a talk on kriya yoga teachings while also answering some questions. on being asked for tips to the youth he said to build a plan for life to be successful and not wait for it to happen.,Health and Wellness
The economic Times,2009-08-07 00:00:00,Swine Flu must be tackled right,"The death of a schoolgirl in Pune from swine flu has raised the spectre of the pandemic hitting the country. Though the panic, especially in Pune, is out of proportion to the ground realities more people die every year of malaria and diarrhoea  the fact is the appalling state of our healthcare systems makes us particularly vulnerable, should the disease take on epidemic proportions.
The latest scare seems to fit in with the World Health Organisation (WHO) observation that in many countries the earliest cases usually occur as school outbreaks before spreading into the wider community.
According to WHO the number of human cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 is still increasing. Since the outbreak of the disease in Mexico in April this year, 168 countries have reported at least one laboratory-confirmed case of the disease.
The WHO's latest (60th) update shows the number of deaths has risen to 1,154 (with the Americas reporting the highest number of deaths at 1,008), up from 816 a week earlier, though estimates from the UK suggest the rate of infection has started to decline.
We are still at the early stage of the pandemic, so chances are we will see an increase in the number of those stricken by the disease, though timely testing and quick remedial action could minimise the number of deaths.
We could take our cue from WHO, which suggests a shift in policy to testing only samples of ill persons because as the pandemic progresses trying to test all ill persons will severely stress our limited resources.
Here we could take a leaf out of the books of the UK where the National Pandemic Flu Service has been launched to ensure better access to antivirals for people with swine flu symptoms. True, given our poor health infrastructure, this might not be possible except in bigger cities.
But the government can and must do two things immediately. It must launch a mass awareness campaign so that there is no widespread panic and it must increase the number of testing centres to beyond government hospitals.
The latter are simply unable to cope with the numbers and if access to testing is not improved we will only see a surge in the number of undetected cases and more panic.
","The recent swine flu case in Pune has caused concern, but it's important to remember that diseases like malaria and diarrhoea actually claim more lives each year. Our healthcare system is not in great shape, which leaves us vulnerable if the disease spreads widely. The World Health Organization notes that outbreaks often start in schools before spreading to the community. The pandemic is still growing globally, with over 1,100 reported deaths. Early testing and action can help save lives. We might consider following WHO's advice to focus testing on those who are sick, as widespread testing could strain our resources. Learning from the UK's approach, we could establish better access to antivirals for those with swine flu symptoms, especially in larger cities. The government should also launch a public awareness campaign to prevent unnecessary panic and increase the number of testing centers outside of government hospitals, as they may become overwhelmed. This way, we can detect cases earlier and reduce panic.",Health and Wellness

This comes as Israeli forces prepare an expected ground assault in response to last weekend’s surprise attack by Hamas.
“We have means of communicating privately with Iran, and we have availed ourselves of those means over the past few days to make clear privately that which we have said publicly,” Jake Sullivan said on CBS News’s Face the Nation.
The US couldn’t rule out that Iran might intervene in the conflict, and was monitoring both the possibility of direct involvement by Tehran and proxy activity by Hezbollah across the border with Lebanon, he said after the US announced that it was sending the USS Eisenhower carrier strike group to the Eastern Mediterranean as tensions escalate in the region.

Talking about this, C Kalyan, president, SIFCC, told BT, “This is going to be a grand affair. We are all fortunate to be present to celebrate such a momentous occasion and we thought that south India should kickstart the celebrations.” Elaborating on the programme, he says, “We are most probably having it between April 26 and 28 in Chennai. The programme will include felicitations of all those who have made a difference in the industry. During the day we will have talks and workshops on filmmaking, while we will have music, dance and other talents showcased in the evenings. The final day will be a gala night, featuring prominent faces from across all industries.” The programme is slated to happen at the Jawaharlal Nehru Indoor Stadium in Chennai, which is currently under renovation. “We plan to approach Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaa to help us get the venue on time. If we do not get it on the desired day, our next option is the Ramoji Rao Film City, Hyderabad. But, since most of the industry and technicians have Chennai roots, we might opt for Chennai,” says Kalyan. Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce (KFCC) President B Vijayakumar, who was also present at the first meeting, says, “We are very excited about this event. We plan on inviting the President of India as the chief guest and also have all the four south Chief Ministers present. As far as Sandalwood is concerned, we are going to form a committee, which will ensure that we put up a visual treat and also contribute to the other activities.” The industries are looking at having around a week’s time without shoots, so that all members from the various associations can take part whole-heartedly. “We will be discussing with the heads of associations, including Ambareesh, Thara and Rockline Venkatesh to figure out the time all their members can take off for rehearsals and other finer details,” says Vijayakumar.

the pioneer,2011-09-29 00:00:00,Nuclear energy needs debate and thought,"Following Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption fast, the country was recently witness to another protest fast that took place on its southern fringes. Around a 150 villagers, mostly fisher folk, from a small village in Tamil Nadu called Idinthakarai, went on an 11-day-long fast to protest against the Koodankulam Nuclear Power Plant which is currently under construction in the Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu.

Popular opinion has it that the agitation in Koodankulam gained ground following the nuclear disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan earlier this year.

The project had seen local cooperation from the start but a recent mandatory safety drill appears to have unleashed fears that something must be amiss or could go wrong later. With local elections around the corner, there is the possibility that this unnecessary sense of alarm has been produced as a result of competitive politics.

The protest against the Koodankulam Nuclear Plant is being spearheaded by a group of activists called People’s Movement against Atomic Power. The project was stepped up on August 15 after the village sabha at Idinthakarai resolved that the plant should not be commissioned even if it had been completed. Fishermen of several coastal villages in the area had also come out strongly against the nuclear power plant, saying it posed a danger to their lives and livelihood.

Protesters withdrew their 11day-long fast only after Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa assured them that she would pass a resolution in the Cabinet and take up the matter with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. While Ms Jayalalithaa seems to have taken a strong stand against setting up the Russian nuclear reactors along the coastal belt in Koodankulam, the fact remains that the first of the two 1,000 MW reactors are already entering their final stages of construction. The project envisages building two 1,000 MW VVER type Russian reactors by the Nuclear Power Corporation.

With regards to safety concerns at the plant, especially in the wake of recent Fukushima disaster, the project’s Site Director, Mr PM Kasinath Balaji, has often pointed to the five-tier safety system of the project. According to Mr Balaji, the buildings that house the reactor and its auxiliary equipment, reactor safety systems, safety diesel generators, the control room and other power generating equipment have all been designed to operate safely under seismic activity. Though the project is located in a Very low Seismic Category Zone2, it has nonetheless been designed to withstand geological turmoil such as a tsunami or an earthquake. Moreover, the former chief of the Atomic Energy Commission has also assured the people that The Atomic Energy Department, the Nuclear Power Corporation of India ltd and the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board have all done extensive checks and they all agree that the circumstances that led to the accident at Fukushima are not at all likely to happen in Koodankulam.",Koodankulam Nuclear Plant is facing protest recently after a safety measure drill by fisher folk of village Idinthakarai. as elections are round the corner it seems this was raised as means to disrupt it. the protest was called off after tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa assured to take this matter to prime minister manmohan singh and pass a resolution in cabinat.,Politics

The Mint,2020-01-01 00:00:00,"Woke millennials and money, the two indeed meet","Millennials form about 47% of India’s working population, making them the largest demographic group in the country. Mint takes a look at how millennials can strike a balance between spending and saving and make the most of their money.
Should you be saving or splurging?

It could irk you when elders say that you need not spend thousands on that foreign holiday or the new iPhone. Millennials and the younger Gen Z are often criticized for spending on things and experiences the previous generations kept away from. However, what gets ignored is that, over time, lifestyles have evolved. Still, does this mean you blow all your money to achieve that perfect Instagram-worthy click? The answer is to spend but only after you have saved for the things that you would certainly need later. You could begin by saving as little as 15-20% of your monthly take-home pay.
Is it ever too late to start investing?

If you’ve just started working, you may feel you have several years ahead of you and investing doesn’t have to start immediately. However, what you should understand is that the earlier you start investing, the better your returns will be. For example, you start investing ₹2,000 every month for the next 25 years. The final value of your investment would be around ₹20 lakh, assuming an 8% annual return. Besides, your investments will only increase as your income goes up, adding to the total pie of investments and also giving that much more scope for compounding to work its magic.
Are credit cards and easy loans a good option?

As there’s so much to indulge in, you could fall short of money. Swiping your credit card could mitigate that situation. As long as you are disciplined and are repaying the outstanding amount on time, using a credit card can help you build a credit score. Payday loans, on the other hand, come at a high interest rate and can trap you in debt.
Is debt a sign of confidence?

Access to credit cards and loans could help boost your financial confidence and make it easier for you to spend. You may take some loans expecting a salary hike or an awaited bonus. The problem arises when the money does not come in. Such fears are more justified at times when the economic outlook is grim as organizations are not liberal with salary hikes or bonuses in such times. Studies have found that while debt gives a boost and sense of self-confidence to people in the 18-27 age group, the feeling fades as people enter their 30s.
How should you strike a balance?

You could be the “cool” one among your peers with your fancy gadgets and branded clothes. But if you are fuelling these expenses through loans, you are not really being “cool”. Getting habituated to credit can land you in a debt trap and you may then have to give up the façade you’ve built. You should instead secure your future while enjoying the small pleasures of life. Financial planners suggest the 30:30:40 rule: Direct 30% of your income towards expenses, 30% towards EMIs and 40% into the savings kitty.","This article discusses financial considerations for millennials in India, who make up a significant portion of the country's workforce. It emphasizes the importance of finding a balance between spending and saving. Key points covered in the article include:

Balancing Spending and Saving: Millennials are often criticized for their spending habits, but it's important to spend after saving for future needs. The article suggests saving at least 15-20% of your monthly income.

Early Investing: Starting to invest early is crucial for better returns. The article highlights the power of compounding and how even small investments over time can grow significantly.

Credit Cards and Loans: While credit cards can be useful when used responsibly, payday loans with high-interest rates can lead to debt traps. Responsible use of credit can also help build a good credit score.

Debt and Confidence: Access to credit can boost financial confidence, but over-reliance on loans can become problematic, especially if salary hikes or bonuses don't materialize as expected. This confidence tends to fade as people enter their 30s.

Balancing Expenses: Financial planners recommend the 30:30:40 rule, which allocates 30% of income to expenses, 30% to EMIs (loan repayments), and 40% into savings.

The article provides practical advice for millennials to manage their finances and secure their future while enjoying the present.

Mint,2020-01-01 00:00:00,A big infra push,"The government is betting big on infrastructure development to achieve India’s $5-trillion economy goal by 2024-25. On Tuesday, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman unveiled a ₹102 trillion infrastructure spending plan for the next five years. The Centre, states, and the private sector will make these investments, though it was unclear how such a huge sum would be financed.

Such projects can sometimes take decades to turn profitable, so banks are often wary of lending if they fear their own short-term funding will not cover the gestation period. An asset-liability mismatch is risky. The public-private partnership finance model has sought to provide a more workable solution, though its success, too, has been chequered. Land acquisition delays and weak enforcement of contracts have also served to dissuade private participation. The scope of the challenge can be gauged from India’s recent infrastructure development record. Despite all the attention, India managed to spend ₹51 trillion on it over the past six years. To double that figure in one less year would require major moves to ease the path. Still, given the resolve, it could be achieved.","The Indian government is making a substantial push for infrastructure development to reach its goal of a $5-trillion economy by 2024-25. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a ₹102 trillion infrastructure spending plan for the next five years, involving investments from the government, states, and the private sector. However, it remains unclear how such a significant sum will be financed.",Business and Finance

Mint,2020-01-02 00:00:00,"RBI’s Operation Twist may boost lending, growth","Recently, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) decided to undertake its own version of Operation Twist to bring down 10-year yields of government securities (G-Secs) and drive monetary transmission. Mint explores this move and its impact on G-Sec yields.
Why is Operation Twist so important?

Operation Twist is a move in which a central bank decides to simultaneously buy long-dated securities while selling short-term securities. The objective behind such an operation is management of the yield curve. Other central banks, including the US Federal Reserve, have used similar measures. This is the first time RBI has undertaken such an unconventional policy measure with the aim of flattening the yield curve by lowering longer rates to boost lending and growth. On Monday, RBI undertook its second round of open market operations (OMOs), the first round of which was undertaken on 23 October.
Did RBI buy, sell bonds of the same amounts?

A conventional Operation Twist involves a central bank buying and selling securities of the same amounts. The purchase of securities pushes down the yields of long-dated securities, while the sale of short-term bonds drives up their yield. This transaction is undertaken as it effectively reduces the term premia. But in the case of RBI’s recent move, on 23 October, the central bank bought a net of ₹10,000 crore of 10-year bonds and sold one-year bonds of ₹6,825 crore. On 30 December, RBI again bought 10-year bonds worth ₹10,000 crore while selling one-year bonds worth ₹8,501 crore.
So did the move have an impact on bond yields?

The recent Operation Twist impacted bond yields that had shot up to 6.705% on 18 December. The move was announced on 19 December 2019 and yields moderated to 6.501% on 1 January 2020. Ending uncertainty on fiscal deficit numbers for 2019-20 and 2020-21 and a credible long-term fiscal consolidation path will help moderate bond yields.
Why did 10-year yields rise after 30 Dec?

In the past, RBI had ruled out its desire to get into yield curve management. But by undertaking Operation Twist, it has provided strong signals to markets that could be well on the cards. Despite this, the second Operation Twist on 30 December didn’t pare yields as investors are jittery due to concerns regarding the FY20 fiscal deficit. RBI also released the calendar for state borrowings of ₹2 trillion for the Q4 FY20. Operation Twist is likely to have subdued the impact of these developments on the yield curve.
Can we expect more such operations?

Over the last few months there has been a call for OMOs to drive monetary transmission. More such operations are possible as RBI tries to improve transmission and the monetary policy panel continues with an accommodative stand. A countercyclical fiscal policy is warranted due to the growth slowdown and is factored in by investors. Thus, by revising deficit targets and creating a credible medium-term consolidation path, the Centre can send bond markets a positive signal, which would supplement RBI’s Operation Twist.

","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently implemented its version of Operation Twist, which involves buying long-dated securities while selling short-term securities. Here's an overview of this move and its impact on government security (G-Sec) yields:

Importance of Operation Twist: Operation Twist is a central bank's strategy to manage the yield curve by buying long-term securities and selling short-term ones. The primary goal is to influence interest rates at different maturities. Other central banks, including the US Federal Reserve, have used similar measures. This was the first time the RBI adopted this unconventional policy measure to flatten the yield curve by reducing longer-term rates, aiming to boost lending and economic growth.

RBI's Transaction Details: The RBI's recent move involved buying ₹10,000 crore worth of 10-year bonds while selling ₹8,501 crore of one-year bonds on December 30th. This approach was intended to reduce term premia, affecting different bond maturities.

Impact on Bond Yields: The recent Operation Twist had a noticeable impact on bond yields, which had risen to 6.705% on December 18. After the move was announced on December 19, 2019, yields dropped to 6.501% on January 1, 2020. The stabilization of bond yields was attributed to ending uncertainty about fiscal deficit figures and establishing a credible long-term fiscal consolidation plan.

Yield Curve Management Signals: While RBI had previously ruled out direct involvement in yield curve management, the Operation Twist signaled a potential shift in its stance. However, the second round of Operation Twist on December 30th didn't have as much effect on yields due to investor concerns about the fiscal deficit for the fiscal year 2019-20. RBI's announcement of state borrowings worth ₹2 trillion for Q4 FY20 also played a role in shaping market sentiment.

Expectation of More Operations: In light of the need to improve monetary transmission, more operations like Operation Twist are expected in the future. The RBI aims to enhance transmission while maintaining an accommodative monetary policy stance. A counter-cyclical fiscal policy is seen as necessary due to economic growth slowdown, and by addressing deficit targets and establishing a credible medium-term consolidation plan, the government can send positive signals to bond markets, complementing the RBI's Operation Twist efforts.

Mint,2020-01-02 00:00:00,Airfare anxiety,"Civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri appears to have pinned the blame for airlines’ losses on “predatory pricing”. They could be headed the telecom way, he warned, if they keep selling tickets below operational costs. Spare a thought for his concerns. Profits are elusive and airfares have failed to keep up with inflation. A virtual cap has been placed on prices by the intensity of competition. As India’s biggest carrier is the state-owned Indian Railways, the government also has reason to worry that people can fly between, say, Mumbai and Delhi, for only a little more money than the cost of an express-service train ticket.

But are airfares in India predatory? The dynamic pricing models of airlines often do seem to offer tickets too cheap to cover expenses. Yet, it isn’t easy to discern whether the aim of this is to wage a war of attrition against rivals. Aviation, after all, is a peculiar market. This is because air carriers offer a perishable product: A seat that goes empty cannot be sold later. If demand is not robust, it would make sense for airlines to sell some seats at passenger-luring discounts just to fill the aircraft. Getting some revenue on these seats is better than none.","The Civil Aviation Minister of India, Hardeep Singh Puri, has expressed concerns about airlines incurring losses due to what he calls ""predatory pricing."" He warns that if airlines continue to sell tickets below operational costs, they could face a situation similar to the telecom industry. Airfares in India have struggled to keep up with inflation, and fierce competition has led to relatively low ticket prices. The government is also worried about this because the state-owned Indian Railways is the country's largest carrier, and air travel is becoming a cheaper alternative to train journeys on some routes.",National News

In Britain, women over 50 are advised to get a mammogram every three years, the results of which are analysed by two independent experts.

But interpreting the scans leaves room for error, and a small percentage of all mammograms either return a false positive (misdiagnosing a healthy patient as having cancer), or false negative (missing the disease as it spreads).

Now researchers at Google Health have trained an artificial intelligence (AI) model to detect cancer in breast scans from thousands of women in Britain and the US.

The team found that their AI model could predict breast cancer from the scans with a similar accuracy level to expert radiographers.

The team also said that further research was needed, but they hoped that the technology could one day act as a “second opinion” for cancer diagnoses.","Researchers at Google Health have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model that can identify breast cancer in routine scans with remarkable accuracy, potentially offering a significant breakthrough in cancer diagnosis.

Mint,2020-01-03 00:00:00,Success of facial recognition tech depends on data,"Facial recognition software is now an integral part of policing, globally. Last month, the police used its automated facial recognition system (AFRS) to screen crowds at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s rally on the citizenship law in Delhi. Mint analyses its features and scope.
What is the purpose of AFRS software?

AFRS is a software that recognizes, records and matches faces against various government databases from photos and videos taken from public and private sources. Its purpose is to find missing children, who may be recorded on CCTV; track criminals across a country; and in the case of Modi’s rally, recognize people who were likely to raise protest slogans at the rally, based on footage recorded from earlier protests. According to reports, people at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan had to pass through a metal detector, during which a camera captured a photo of their faces and scanned it against a database in a matter of seconds.
How does the software work?

The police’s AFRS is different from the facial recognition systems used on smartphones. The latter is based on the ISO 19794-5 standard meant for consumer biometrics; the police’s software is more “restrictive”, as per the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) document seeking proposals for the system. It measures facial features and uses the measure-ments to create a “template” to be matched against others, says an American Bar Association study. Law enforcement’s software is meant to work in various light conditions; detect make-up, plastic surgery or ageing; and work against sketches of subjects.
Can facial recognition technology be beaten?

A review of the London Metropolitan Police’s facial recognition system by academics from the University of Essex in July 2019 showed that the system had erred in 81% of the cases. However, law enforcement bodies worldwide have adopted the system, although there are enough reports for and against the software.
Which databases does AFRS have access to?

The NCRB document says AFRS should be able to check against various databases. Besides the criminal database, it mentions the passport database; the Aadhaar database that includes your photo may be used too. It mentions the Immigration, Visa and Foreigners’ Registration Tracking database, the ministry of women and child development’s Khoya-Paya and the National Automated Fingerprint Identification System. It can match a photo against many and compare one photo with another. The more the data, the better is the output.
What is the scope of India’s AFRS?

NCRB’s proposal clearly states that while a centralized web application will be hosted in the crime record bureau’s data centre in Delhi, it will be made available to “all police stations of the country”. That means AFRS certainly stretches on a national scale. Furthermore, Delhi Police also required the software to work on Android, iOS and Windows platforms. “NCRB has already proposed the provision of mobile data terminals to each police station,” states the proposal document.","Automated Facial Recognition Software (AFRS) has become an integral part of policing, with the potential to serve various purposes. Here are the key points regarding AFRS:

Purpose of AFRS: AFRS is software designed to recognize, record, and match faces from photos and videos against government databases. Its purposes include finding missing children captured on CCTV, tracking criminals across a country, and identifying individuals based on previous protests or events, such as Prime Minister Narendra Modi's rally in Delhi.

How AFRS Works: AFRS used by law enforcement differs from facial recognition systems on smartphones. It measures facial features to create a template for matching faces. This technology can work in various lighting conditions, detect makeup, plastic surgery, aging, and even sketches of subjects.

Effectiveness and Limitations: While AFRS technology is being adopted globally by law enforcement agencies, its accuracy can vary. An academic review of London's Metropolitan Police's facial recognition system found errors in 81% of cases, highlighting its limitations.

Access to Databases: AFRS has access to various databases, including criminal, passport, Aadhaar (which includes photos), Immigration, Visa, Foreigners' Registration Tracking, Khoya-Paya (a child tracking system), and the National Automated Fingerprint Identification System. The more data available, the more accurate the system's output.

Scope in India: India's AFRS initiative aims for a centralized web application hosted at the National Crime Records Bureau's data center in Delhi. It will be made available to all police stations in the country, demonstrating its national scale. The software is also expected to work on multiple platforms, including Android, iOS, and Windows, with the provision of mobile data terminals to police stations.

AFRS technology has the potential to assist law enforcement in various aspects but also raises concerns regarding privacy, accuracy, and ethical use.

The case pivots on complex questions of majority versus minority shareholder rights. Ratan Tata controls the Tata Trusts, which own nearly two-thirds of Tata Sons’ equity, while the Mistry family owns about 18.4%. Majority control is almost axiomatic in business, and so Tata seems to have had the authority to oust a key manager. But, was Mistry one? This could be open to interpretation.

Controversy also erupted over whether the NCLAT could rule on a minority oppression case if Tata Sons wasn’t going bust. Even more hair has been split over its switch from public to private. Instead of getting the Centre’s approval, the group reportedly used a circular that only needed the Registrar of Companies’ nod. What drew suspicion to the move’s motive was that it could have granted Tata a handle on Mistry’s shares, a lever that wasn’t used. But still, such a vulnerability can’t be overlooked, can it?

Mint,2020-01-06 00:00:00,The govt is likely to find it hard to trim fiscal deficit,"The budgeted fiscal deficit for 2019-20 stands at ₹7.04 trillion. However, the fiscal deficit for the period April-November is higher than this and stands at ₹8.08 trillion. Mint takes a look at the options before the government to reduce the fiscal deficit.Why has the fiscal deficit crossed ₹8 tn?

The fiscal deficit of ₹8.08 trillion for April-November is nearly 15% more than the budgeted fiscal deficit for the year, with data for four months yet to be available. Fiscal deficit basically has two entries: the total expenditure of the government and its total earnings. The total expenditure during the first eight months of the fiscal is ₹18.20 trillion. This is a little over 65% of the expenditure that the government plans to make during the year. Hence, things are all right on the expenditure front. The problems are on the earnings front, in particular the tax revenues that the government had hoped to earn during this fiscal.hat’s wrong with the tax revenue growth?

The gross tax revenue collected by the government during the first eight months of the fiscal was ₹11.74 trillion, around 0.8% higher than during the same period last year. Hence. tax collections have been largely flat this year. The interesting thing is that the gross tax revenue needs to grow 18.3% from last year’s collections for the government to earn what it has projected in the budget. Finance ministry bureaucrats were not expecting the economy and tax collections to slow down as much as they have. The economy grew by a little over 7% in the first half of this fiscal. The growth in tax collections hasn’t matched that.How do things look for the remaining part of this fiscal?

The gross tax revenue that the government had hoped to earn this fiscal is ₹24.61 trillion. It has barely earned around 48% of this in the first eight months of the fiscal. It is highly unlikely for the government to earn the remaining 52% between December 2019 and March 2020. This means there is a large hole in its budget for the current fiscal.Can disinvestment solve this problem?

The disinvestment of public sector enterprises was supposed to bring in ₹1.05 trillion this fiscal. Until November, only ₹18,099 crore or 17% of the projected amount had been earned. Media reports seem to suggest major disinvestments that the government has planned won’t go through this year. That basically leaves the government with two ways of trimming the fiscal deficit: cutting down on expenditure or not showing it. Reducing expenditure when government spending is driving growth would be a bad idea.
What does it mean not to show expenditure?

Over the years, the government hasn’t paid the food subsidy dues of the Food Corporation of India (FCI) on time. It can try this trick this time as well. Given that the government works on cash accounting, when it decides not to pay for an expenditure it doesn’t show up in the books of the government. Of course, FCI has to borrow this money to keep functioning. Banks lend to FCI mainly because they believe they are lending to the government.

Vivek Kaul is an economist and the author of the Easy Money trilogy.","India's fiscal deficit for the period of April to November has surpassed the budgeted amount, standing at ₹8.08 trillion, which is nearly 15% higher than the budgeted fiscal deficit for the entire fiscal year. The fiscal deficit is affected by both total government expenditures and earnings, and while expenditures are within expectations, the issue lies with tax revenues.

Tax collections have remained largely flat this fiscal year, with gross tax revenue growing only 0.8% compared to the same period in the previous year. However, the government had anticipated an 18.3% growth in gross tax revenue to meet its budgeted projections. The gap between actual revenue and budgeted revenue poses a significant challenge for the government in terms of meeting its fiscal deficit targets for the year.

The government's target for gross tax revenue for the fiscal year is ₹24.61 trillion, and it has only collected around 48% of this amount during the first eight months. The government is unlikely to bridge this revenue gap by the end of the fiscal year, making it difficult to meet its fiscal deficit goals.

One potential solution for reducing the fiscal deficit is disinvestment, which was expected to bring in ₹1.05 trillion this fiscal year. However, disinvestment progress has been slow, with only 17% of the projected amount earned by November. Media reports suggest that major disinvestments planned by the government may not materialize as expected, further complicating the fiscal situation.

To address the deficit issue, the government might have to consider either cutting down on expenditure, which could negatively impact growth, or adopting strategies like delaying payments for expenditures, which would not be reflected in the government's books but would require borrowing by institutions like the Food Corporation of India to meet their obligations.",Business and Finance

Iran vowed revenge against the US for killing one of its top commanders last week. If geopolitical tensions escalate, oil prices could zoom and throw the country’s finances into disarray. We import over three-quarters of the stuff.

Indian exports have been stagnant, so a sharp rise in our import bill would likely widen the gap between what we spend and what we earn in dollars. Retail fuel prices could be kept stable if levies are slashed, but that would strain the governments’ already-stretched fiscal deficit. Increased debt taken on by the Centre tends to push up market rates of interest. Alternatively, if fuel prices are raised, inflation control may require the central bank to tighten money availability, which would have the same adverse effect. The country has been fortunate that oil has not been terribly volatile over the past half decade, allowing the government to overtax fuel. Let’s prepare for new complexities.

Mint,2020-01-08 00:00:00,Productivity has big role in India’s $5 tn GDP dream,"The slowdown has revived interest in India’s growth rate as it aspires to become a $5 trillion economy. This would require growing at 8% in real terms, along with a 0.7% rise in total factor productivity (TFP). Mint explains the intricate relationship between TFP and growth.What are the factors for economic growth?

Economic growth is a function of the quantity of inputs such as labour and capital employed for productive purposes, along with factor productivity. It is intuitive that if more people are employed, more goods and services would be produced. Over time, due to a rise in population, labour employed increases and due to accumulation, capital also increases in an economy. A rise in productivity enables an economy to grow faster with the same set of labour and capital being employed. It is important to recognize the factors responsible for growth to address the current slowdown.What is total factor productivity?

Total factor productivity (TFP) is derived as a ratio of the total production and weighted average of inputs such as labour and capital. The measure gives us the growth in real output, which is in addition to the growth in inputs such as labour or capital employed for productive purposes. So TFP gives us the relationship between the quantity of factors employed and the output in an economy. A higher TFP implies higher growth with the same set of labour and capital employed. TFP as a concept was first discussed by Nikolaas Tinbergen (1942) and George Stigler (1947); Robert Solow (1957) developed the framework further.How has India’s TFP growth evolved over the years?

As per the Total Economy Database (TED), India’s adjusted GDP growth in 2005 was 9%, while TFP growth was 3.5%; in 2006, growth was 9.3% and TFP growth 3.3%; in 2007, the figures were 10.1% and 3.1%, respectively. Evidently, growth came with a substantial improvement in TFP. In 2016 India’s TFP growth was 3.5%, in 2017 it was 1.6% and in 2018 it was 2.4%.What is the global trend on TFP growth?

Since 2008, TFP growth has been slower for most nations; for China it has been negative since 2012. TED and Federal Reserve Economic Data on TFP and GDP growth show most economies with 8% or higher growth had TFP growth above 3%. These countries also saw a substantial rise in private capital formation in that period. Recent evidence indicates TFP might impact GDP growth more than fixed capital. Better TFP does seem to have a positive impact on growth of an economy, whether emerging or developed.What are the factors affecting TFP?

India can improve its TFP by undertaking bold market and structural reforms that will unshackle its productive capacity, stuck in the primary sector of the economy. Such reforms can cause reallocation of land and labour from primary to other sectors of the economy, thus enhancing productivity. Investments in physical infrastructure such as highways, dedicated freight corridors, and human capital will also increase TFP.

Karan Bhasin is a Delhi-based policy researcher.","ndia's aspiration to become a $5 trillion economy requires consistent economic growth. To achieve this, India would need to grow at an 8% real rate with a 0.7% increase in Total Factor Productivity (TFP). Understanding the relationship between TFP and economic growth is essential.

Factors for Economic Growth:
Economic growth relies on inputs such as labor and capital utilized for productive purposes, along with factor productivity. As more people are employed and capital accumulates over time, the quantity of labor and capital increases in an economy. Increased productivity enables an economy to grow more quickly using the same resources.

Total Factor Productivity (TFP):
TFP is calculated as the ratio of total production to the weighted average of inputs (e.g., labor and capital). It reflects the additional growth in real output beyond the growth in inputs. Higher TFP indicates greater growth with the same labor and capital inputs. TFP is a critical factor for achieving economic growth.

Evolution of TFP Growth in India:
India has seen fluctuations in TFP growth over the years. It played a significant role in India's economic growth between 2005 and 2007. However, in recent years, TFP growth has been inconsistent, which has contributed to the current economic slowdown.

Global Trend on TFP Growth:
Since 2008, TFP growth has been slower in most nations. China has experienced negative TFP growth since 2012. Nations with 8% or higher GDP growth typically had TFP growth above 3%. Recent evidence suggests that TFP might have a more substantial impact on GDP growth than fixed capital.

Factors Affecting TFP:
India can enhance its TFP by implementing market and structural reforms to unlock productive capacity, particularly in the primary sector of the economy. These reforms could facilitate the reallocation of land and labor from the primary sector to other sectors, leading to increased productivity. Investments in physical infrastructure, such as highways and human capital, can also boost TFP.

In summary, India's journey to a $5 trillion economy is closely linked to TFP growth. Implementing reforms and making strategic investments are vital steps in improving TFP and fostering sustainable economic growth.

Mint,2020-01-08 00:00:00,Death for rape,"The four convicts who were awarded death sentences for the horrific 2012 rape of a paramedical student aboard a bus in Delhi will be hanged in Tihar Jail on 22 January, according to a warrant issued by a city court. It was an attack of such brutality that it drew thousands of demonstrators onto the capital’s streets, demanding justice. Many believe that this demand is finally about to be met. As a case, it was indeed “rarest of rare”, the judiciary’s criterion for capital punishment.

Yet every execution should be an occasion for solemn reflection. Not just on such a penalty, but also on whether all rapists should routinely be put to death, as many Indians seem to want. The deterrent effect of a noose remains in dispute, even as few sexual crimes are open-and-shut cases. Conclusive evidence is hard to find, and judicial processes are imperfect. If the standards of evidence to pin guilt are kept loose, some innocents might end up at the gallows. If they’re kept strict, a lot of culprits might get away. And if the punishment is irreversible, our courts are likely to veer towards the latter. The country’s rape conviction rate is already low. It could drop further.

","The four convicts who were sentenced to death for the brutal 2012 rape of a paramedical student aboard a bus in Delhi are set to be hanged on 22 January. The case sparked widespread protests and demands for justice. While this particular case met the judiciary's criteria for capital punishment as the ""rarest of rare,"" it raises questions about whether all rapists should routinely receive the death penalty, as some Indians advocate.

The efficacy of the death penalty as a deterrent remains a subject of debate, and many sexual assault cases are complex with inconclusive evidence. Striking the right balance between strict standards of evidence to secure convictions and the risk of wrongful executions is challenging. India already has a low rape conviction rate, which could decrease further if capital punishment is widely imposed.

Each execution should be an occasion for solemn reflection, not only on the penalty itself but also on the broader questions surrounding the death penalty for sexual crimes.",National News
Mint,2023-01-04 00:00:00,"India Inc, put R&D where your mouth is","PM Narendra Modi's strong pitch at the 108th Indian Science Congress for research & development (R&D) on Tuesday underlined the criticality of science and innovation for growth. The stress on taking science from the laboratory to everyday lives is a call for innovation that provides the basis for India's drive to be self-reliant. The focus on critical and emerging areas such as energy, sustainability, artificial intelligence (AI), quantum technologies, data sciences, development of new vaccines and surveillance for newer diseases will have maximum impact on growth, development and economic opportunities.

Modi's appeal took off from his 2022 Independence Day address where he had emphasised the need for ideas to be incubated, developed, tested and applied to real-life situations institutionally and not in an ad-hoc manner. An institutional framework alone can help create the structure for mentorship, access to opportunities and help convert research into real-world applications and opportunities. This, in turn, requires funding, institutional support and patience. India's R&D spending must increase from its low levels of 0.7% of GDP in 2017-18. This is less than half of the global average of 1.8%. Government spending accounts for 55-60% of R&D spending. Spending by private entities, businesses and educational institutions must go up.

India's R&D should focus on leveraging low-cost, accessible technology to meet the developmental needs of its population.

Last week, the Union Environment ministry had taken cognisance of the representations it had received on the issue and had written to the state government to consider denotification of the ESZ area. It has been assessed that keeping just two of the affected village areas out
of the ESZ notification will address the concerns of the protesters.
The central government had notified the area as eco-sensitive zone in
August 2019 based on the state government's proposal. The notification
also gave a mandate to the state government to prepare a tourism
development plan for the area.
Sources told ET that the Jharkhand government led by chief minister
Hemant Soren is likely to hold a meeting to take a decision and the
state government will write to the Centre for the denotification.
""The state government is committed to preserve the sanctity of the
place in consonance with the feelings of the Jain community. The

liquor and non-vegetarian food in the area. Besides, the state
government in its Tourism Policy 2022 specifically mandates the
tourism department to develop Parasnath hills as a Jain Pilgrimage

Mint,2020-01-09 00:00:00,"The link between growth, demand and investment","As per the government’s first advance estimate, gross domestic product (GDP) growth for FY20 is likely to be 5%—the lowest since the global financial crisis of 2008-09, when it fell to 3.1%. To examine the fall, Mint takes a detailed look at India’s GDP numbers.

Private consumption expenditure, the money you and I spend on buying things, has comprised 56-57% of India’s GDP (in real terms, adjusted for inflation) over the past few years. In FY20, it is expected to grow at 5.8%, after growing at over 7.4% in each of the last four fiscals. This can clearly be seen in the fall in sales of cars, two-wheelers and tractors, and the slower volume growth of FMCG companies. People are not spending as much money on buying things as they used to, given the lack of confidence they have in their economic future. This is reflected in slow growth of private consumption expenditure.
What is investment’s part in the fall?

Investment is a key driver of consumption. Investment growth in FY20 is expected to collapse to 1%, the lowest since FY06 (i.e., as far back as growth data for the current GDP series goes). Without proper investment growth, jobs can’t be created. And without jobs, there won’t be a source of income for the million Indians entering the workforce every month. Only when people earn can they spend. Also, one man’s expenditure is another man’s income—creating a cycle. Hence, a slowdown in investment growth is bound to affect private consumption, which, in turn, will slow down GDP growth in FY20.What is the state of government expenditure?

Government expenditure—growing 9.3% in FY19 and 15% in FY18—has driven growth between 2017-19. In FY20, it is expected to grow 10.5%, the fastest among all constituents of GDP (others being private consumption expenditure, investment and net exports). This fiscal, the government’s share in the economy will reach 11.3%, the highest in a decade.What about the non-govt part of economy?

If we leave government expenditure out of the GDP, what remains is the non-government part of the economy. This part is expected to grow at 4.3% in FY20—the lowest since 2008-09, when it had grown 2.2%. This is hardly surprising given the slow private consumption growth and plunging investment growth. The non-government component forms around 90% of the economy, and it’s this part that needs a boost if the overall economy is to be revived. Higher government spending can only do so much.So what can the government do?

In the short run, consumption growth needs to be revived, without which investments are unlikely to improve. Companies invest when people consume. To ensure this, the government can put more money in the hands of people via a personal income tax cut, and spend more on social schemes, such as MGNREGS. Also, the GST Council needs to stop fiddling around with the goods and services tax and go for a comprehensive overhaul. Vivek Kaul is an economist and the author of the Easy Money trilogy.","India's GDP growth for FY20 is estimated to be 5%, the lowest since the global financial crisis in 2008-09. The fall can be attributed to declining private consumption expenditure and a collapse in investment growth. Investment is crucial as it drives consumption, job creation, and income generation. The government's expenditure has played a significant role in driving growth, while the non-government part of the economy, comprising 90% of GDP, is expected to grow at its lowest rate since 2008-09. To revive the economy, policies aimed at boosting consumption and investment are essential, such as tax cuts and increased spending on social schemes.",Business and Finance

At one of her recent shows on New Year’s Eve, English
singer-songwriter Adele disclosed that she is battling sciatica. 
Adele talked to the audience and revealed that she is suffering from
the condition while walking from one end of the stage to another when
she was hosting a show on New Year’s Eve (December 31, 2022) at The

causing pain in her lower back. 
WHAT IS SCIATICA?
Sciatica happens when pain travels along the sciatic nerve, which runs
from the lower back via the buttocks and hips to each leg.
The pain in the sciatic nerve can be severe, but it can be fixed in a
matter of weeks. It generally occurs when an overgrowth of bone or a
herniated disk in the spine puts pressure on the nerve. It leads to
pain, inflammation and numbness in the affected leg.
In some rare cases, a tumor can also put pressure on the nerve.
Conditions like diabetes can also damage the nerve leading to the
issue.
Adele has talked about her health problems earlier as well. In
November 2021, while speaking to a magazine, she spoke about how her
life has changed after weight loss.

The Mineral Laws (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020, will end the restrictive end-use criterion for coal-mine block allocations. The extant rules bar companies other than coal washeries and those that need it as raw material, such as power generators and iron and steel makers, from bidding for coal mines. The ordinance opens up mining to all firms with offices registered in India.

The move promises to expedite projects and paves the way for commercial mining. It aims to reduce coal imports, and may soon end Coal India Ltd’s monopoly on sales. The Centre is keen to auction some coal blocks before the end of FY20, as its finances look stretched and it urgently needs money to close the gap between its revenues and expenses. As a result of the end-use restriction, India had been able to hawk no more than 29 coal blocks since the Supreme Court cancelled the allotment of more than 200 blocks in 2014.

India is a relative ""bright spot"" in the world economy and further

top International Monetary Fund official said Friday. ""India is a
relative bright spot in the world economy today, growing at rates
significantly above its peer average,"" IMF deputy managing director

Sayeh said India needs to leverage its existing strength in services
exports and extend it to job-rich manufacturing exports by deepening
its global value chain participation and complementary structural
reforms that can boost productivity, formal employment and exports.
""Doing so would create a virtuous cycle of productivity growth and
strong export performance,"" she said.

IMF has forecast a 6.8% growth for India in FY23, which is projected
to slow to 6.1% in FY24.
Sayeh said macroeconomic policies were responding to the significant
headwinds, with fiscal policy measures supporting vulnerable groups
and monetary policy addressing persistently high inflation.
She pointed out that the country's world-class digital public
infrastructure was facilitating innovation, productivity improvements,
and access to public and financial services in India.
""India is making important progress on its structural reform agenda,
and further implementation of the reforms would help unlock its growth
potential,"" she said.
Addressing the media separately, she said the country will need to be
more ambitious on the revenue side and look at simplification of goods
and services tax and income tax and provide a clearer path on fiscal
consolidation.
The IMF has in its Article IV consultation report released last month
cautioned that India's fiscal space was at risk and called for a more
ambitious and well-communicated consolidation to ensure medium-term
fiscal sustainability.
Sayeh, addressing the event, said trade and investment reforms, by
reducing tariffs and non-tariff barriers, for both goods and in
particular high value services such as professional services, will be
pivotal in raising competitiveness and establishing regional supply
chains to benefit South Asia.
She said the disruptions to key industries in the rest of Asia
provided opportunities for South Asia as global value chains realign.
But, she said, to benefit from these developments, the region needs to
put in place necessary structural conditions through further
liberalisation and regulatory reforms.
She also cautioned against geo-economic fragmentation. ""We see the
number of trade restrictions rising and the sectoral composition of
trade restrictions has been shifting... Asia has gained a lot from
openness and integration, and we hope for strong international
cooperation to avoid fragmentation.""
Sayeh said over the past two decades, extreme poverty declined from
500 million to fewer than 250 million people in Bangladesh, Bhutan,
India, the Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka, but now poverty reduction
cannot be taken for granted and is instead the result of policy
choices.",IMF deputy managing director said India is a relative bright spot due to higher growth but needs further reforms.

Mint,2020-01-13 00:00:00,Why are Indians in the grip of a gold obsession?,"The price of gold crossed ₹40,000 per 10g last week. Since the beginning of this fiscal, gold prices have surged by around 25%, driving down gold imports by a fifth during the same period. Mint takes a look at India’s love for gold.By how much have gold imports reduced?

Between April and November, India imported 533,376kg of gold, around 20.3% less than 669,339kg imported during the same period in 2018. This is hardly surprising since gold has turned costlier this fiscal. Between April and November, the average price of gold was ₹35,337 per 10g, against ₹30,689 during the same period a year ago. Since November, prices have rallied higher due to Iran-US tensions. Over and above this, the easy money policy of the US Federal Reserve has made a comeback. The Fed has resumed printing money in order to drive down interest rates. This has pushed up gold prices as well.What explains the love Indians have for gold?

Since very little gold is produced in India, almost all of the metal consumed is imported. Over the years, Indians have continued to love gold. In FY19, India imported 983,000kg of gold, the highest since FY14. A major reason for our love for gold remains tradition. But there is more to it than just that. As Richard Davies writes in Extreme Economies, “Gold also acts as a kind of informal insurance mechanism.” He writes this in the context of Aceh, a semi-autonomous province of Indonesia, and how survivors of the 2004 Asian tsunami rebuilt their lives using the gold they had on their bodies.How did gold help in the aftermath of the tsunami?

As Davies writes: “While some lost gold in the disaster, I met many survivors who were able to sell jewellery they were wearing… Wearing a gold bangle is like having enough cash on your wrist to employ a builder for a year… This traditional form of finance insulated Aceh and provided its entrepreneurs with rapid access to cash.”
How is this linked to India’s love for gold?

Like in Aceh, India also has a very strong informal system of exchange where gold can be rapidly turned into cash, especially in times of emergency. As Davies writes again in the context of Aceh: “In an economy buffeted by the ups and downs of farming and fishing, the people are used to buying gold after bumper harvests or fishing seasons and selling it after lean ones.” This applies as much to India as it does to Aceh, with a bulk of the country’s workforce still dependent on agriculture for a living.What do economists make of this system?

Economists, especially those working in the West, are used to banks and a formal financial system being in place and working well, even during emergencies. Buying and holding on to gold doesn’t fit into their way of doing things. But as Davies puts it, “A woman’s gold is both her personal treasure and plays a functional role as the family’s financial buffer.” That is the long and the short of India’s love for gold.","Indians have a deep-seated cultural and traditional attachment to gold, which is one of the key reasons why the country has such a strong affinity for the precious metal. Beyond tradition, gold also serves as an informal insurance mechanism in India. With very little gold being produced within the country, almost all the gold consumed is imported. This love for gold is partly due to the flexible and liquid nature of gold ownership, allowing individuals to quickly convert it to cash when needed. This quality of gold as an emergency financial resource has a strong influence on the Indian psyche. In rural economies heavily dependent on agriculture, gold can serve as a buffer against economic fluctuations. For many, buying and holding gold is a rational economic choice, providing a personal treasure that plays a functional role as a financial safety net.",Business and Finance
Mint,2020-01-13 00:00:00,Three to tango,"India’s industrial sector has recorded an upturn, clocking its first expansion in four months last November. At 1.8%, the growth is little to write home about, but for an economy feared to be grinding down, the mere fact of a positive change in the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) is a big relief. The figure seems to confirm an improvement in manufacturing activity, indicated recently by the country’s Purchasing Managers’ Index. Since we’re eager to see signs of a revival, it’s tempting to break into a song and dance over the IIP reading. We should resist that temptation. For one, it would take at least three successive readings to form a trend. For another, car sales and other data remain subdued.

As revenue projections are made for next fiscal year’s budget, it is all the more advisable for policymakers to take a realistic view of the future. Tax collections this year fell far below what the government had expected, forcing it to scramble for money. Yes, industrial output may well have bottomed out, but to assume that it has on the basis of one or two pieces of data could warp the country’s budget calculations for yet another year.","India's industrial sector saw a slight upturn in November, marking its first expansion in four months, with a growth rate of 1.8%.

units and rice mills. The NCB official said in Mohali that action
against the syndicate began on November 15, with the seizure of
contraband and a person's arrest.
""A special investigation team under Amanjit Singh, zonal director, NCB

Mint,2020-01-15 00:00:00,Why the CCI is getting worried about e-tail wags,"The Competition Commission of India (CCI) ordered a probe into Amazon and Flipkart for alleged deep discounting and unfair trade practices. The matter, once a toss between pricing and convenience, now has jobs and international relations at its heart. Mint takes a look.What are the online retailers accused of?

Amazon and Flipkart are accused of offering deep discounts on products to buyers through select preferred sellers. Not all sellers on the platforms are handed this. As such, these deep discounts deny them the opportunity of higher sales. The online retailers are also accused of tweaking their search algorithms, which results in their preferred sellers appearing on top of the websites and thus having a better chance of being chosen by buyers. It is alleged that other sellers are relegated to sell only through the brick and mortar set-up, preventing them from having the pan-India reach that online marketplaces offer.how are e-retailers able to dominate?

It is alleged that Amazon and Flipkart are able to cross-subsidize due to the huge amount of funding received from their investors. This allows them to price products below cost through their sellers. This, in turn, creates high entry barriers for a new entrant. The online retailers allegedly force sellers, which are not among the preferred ones, to sign skewed agreements that they can terminate as per their will. For products such as mobile phones, they enter into exclusive tie-ups with manufacturers, thereby creating a monopoly and in turn denying the consumer the option of buying from elsewhere.What is the sales model that’s under scanner?

Amazon and Flipkart are platforms for sellers and manufacturers to sell their wares. Both have multiple vendors supplying any given product. Both also have private label brands sourced from preferred manufacturers and sold through preferred sellers. The law doesn’t allow them to hold their own inventory or sell directly to consumers.What’s the fear around online retailers?

E-retailers act as intermediaries between buyer and seller, allowing them to gather critical data, including price, quantities sold, demand of each product, seller and geography. They can use the information to launch their private labels in categories where they think it’s profitable for them or use their preferred sellers for this. It enables them to target consumers better with recommendations for products and customized offerings. Another worry is sellers find that transparency is generally missing in online product reviews.What do e-retailers say in their defence?

CCI’s 38-page “Market Study on E-Commerce in India” says market-place platforms maintain that all sellers listed on their platforms, including those selling private labels, are independent. Thus, it is not incentive-compatible for them to prefer a few at the expense of quality of the platform, given the stiff competition that exists in what is predominantly an offline retail landscape. E-retailers also deny any role in pricing. CCI will take a call on the findings, while ensuring that competition and efficiency are not compromised.","The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has initiated an investigation into Amazon and Flipkart for alleged deep discounting and unfair trade practices. The e-commerce giants are accused of providing significant discounts to customers through select preferred sellers, while excluding others from the same opportunities. They are also alleged to manipulate search algorithms to give preference to their favored sellers. These practices are said to distort competition and potentially harm other sellers, preventing them from having equal access to online marketplaces. Additionally, CCI is investigating whether the firms have been using their funding to cross-subsidize deep discounts, thus creating high entry barriers for new competitors. The investigation aims to ensure competition and efficiency in the e-commerce sector without compromising the interests of consumers.",Business and Finance

Mint,2020-01-16 00:00:00,Malaysia’s palm oil trade meets a Kashmir hurdle,"Trade tensions between India and Malaysia have aggravated with the Narendra Modi government’s latest move to restrict palm oil imports from the latter. Mint takes a look at the genesis of the problem and how this is likely to impact trade between the two countries.What’s the backdrop for the stand-off?

India-Malaysia ties turned bitter as the latter gave shelter in 2016 to radical Islamic preacher Zakir Naik, who is wanted by Indian counterterrorism agencies. On 4 September, India decided to raise customs duty on import of refined palm oil from Malaysia to 50% from 45% for six months. On 27 September, speaking at the UN, Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad alleged that India had “invaded and occupied” Kashmir and asked it to resolve the issue with Pakistan. On 20 December, he said that India’s Citizenship Amendment Act would deprive some Muslims of their citizenship.What measures has India taken so far?

In October, India’s top vegetable oil trade body, Solvent Extractors’ Association of India, told members to stop buying Malaysian palm oil at the behest of the government. Indian refiners resumed buying palm oil from Malaysia after a one-month suspension as it began offering a $5 a tonne discount over supplies from Indonesia. India’s move on 8 January putting refined palm oil on the restricted list was a tacit signal to Malaysia. It means India will have more control on the source of import of the item as the importer will need a licence for the inbound shipment. Reports say the curbs could extend to import of electronic items from Malaysia.How do India’s import curbs impact Malaysia?

Palm oil is crucial for the Malaysian economy as it accounts for 2.8% of gross domestic product and 4.5% of total exports. State-owned and private Malaysian refineries will likely have to scramble to find new buyers for their refined product. Malaysia is the world’s second-largest producer of palm oil after Indonesia.Where does Malaysia stand on trade ties?

India and Malaysia signed the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) in 2011 building upon the 2009 India-Asean free trade pact. Malay-sia is India’s third-largest trading partner in Asean. India’s exports and imports with Malaysia stood at $6.4 billion and $10.8 billion, respectively in FY19. Palm oil imports from Malaysia jumped in recent months as it has a duty advantage over Indonesia under CECA. Malaysia has thus overtaken Indonesia as India’s biggest palm oil supplier in 2019.How has Malaysia reacted to the curbs?

Mahathir has expressed concern over India’s move to restrict import of palm oil from his country, while insisting that he would continue to speak up. “We are concerned of course because we sell a lot of palm oil to India, but on the other hand we need to be frank and see that if something goes wrong, we will have to say it,” he said on Saturday. Meanwhile, Malaysian Trades Union Congress, members of which include palm workers, has urged the two countries to resolve the matter through talks.","Trade tensions between India and Malaysia have escalated due to political issues, with India imposing restrictions on palm oil imports from Malaysia. The rift began with Malaysia giving shelter to Islamic preacher Zakir Naik in 2016, who is wanted by Indian counterterrorism agencies. Additionally, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad criticized India's actions in Kashmir and the Citizenship Amendment Act. India has taken measures such as suspending palm oil imports, imposing increased customs duties, and putting refined palm oil on the restricted list. These restrictions have a significant impact on Malaysia, as palm oil accounts for a significant portion of its economy. Malaysia is India's third-largest trading partner in Asean, and the two countries have signed various trade agreements. Malaysia has expressed concern over India's moves and called for dialogue to resolve the situation.",International News

Deliveries tumbled to just 380 jetliners last year, Boeing said in a statement Tuesday. That was less than half of Airbus’s tally of 863 planes.

For the first time in at least three decades, Boeing also finished the year with negative net orders by one measure. The gross sales of 246 jets that it garnered were surpassed by those taken off the books due to order conversions, cancellations and an accounting adjustment, Bank of America Corp. analyst Ron Epstein said in a report.

Boeing’s epic trouncing underscored the depth of the Max crisis after global regulators halted commercial flights and deliveries of the model in March, following two crashes that killed 346 people. Airbus’s victory was its first since 2011 and 10th since 1974, when the European company’s A300 jetliner made its commercial debut. Last year, Boeing shipped only 127 of its single-aisle 737 planes, lagging Airbus’s narrow-body total of 690 jets. But the Chicago-based company scored a win in twin-aisle jets, delivering 253—80 more than Airbus.

Mint,2020-01-16 00:00:00,Trade worries,"India’s December trade figures deepen concerns about the health of our economy. Official figures show that merchandise exports dipped 1.8% from a year earlier to $27.36 billion, marking the fifth straight month of decline. A consolation is that imports fell by a larger 8.8%, helping narrow the trade deficit. But the relief could be temporary. If crude oil prices surge on tensions in West Asia, our import bill could soar.

What needs to be addressed is the sustained fall in exports. At the current rate, India would be lucky this year to match 2018-19’s export figure of $331 billion, let alone exceed it. Global demand remains weak, but action points do exist. Exporters have suffered delayed tax refunds, which need to be cleared quickly. Having walked out of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, India should up its efforts to strike bilateral trade deals. Also, the rupee’s external value may be too high. It seems more a function of foreign inflows into our capital markets than of trade dynamics. While incoming dollars are welcome, the resultant upward pressure on the rupee has blunted the competitiveness of Indian exports, and that’s not good.","India's December trade figures reveal ongoing concerns about the nation's economic health.

Mint,2020-01-17 00:00:00,A contraction in CAD may not be a reason for cheer,"Data released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) shows India’s current account deficit (CAD) reduced to 0.9% of GDP in the second quarter of 2019-20 from 2% in the first, primarily due to a lower trade deficit. Mint argues that the improvement in CAD may not be a good thing.What makes up current account?

Current account is essentially a record of all trade, net transfers and earning transactions of a country with the rest of the world. Therefore, current account has four essential components. The first is trade, the net value of goods and services. The second is net income, defined as income earned by residents from the rest of the world minus the income paid to foreigners. The third is direct transfers, which record net remittances, and the fourth is asset income. Current account is said to be in surplus when the value of exports is greater than that of imports; it is in deficit when the value of imports is higher.Why is it bad if the trade deficit is high?

International trade has become an important political economy issue in advanced economies such as the US and the UK. Developed economies have become concerned with the extent of their CADs and have used trade policies to reduce them. This isn’t new as mercantilism was widely practised in the 16-18th centuries when countries focused on using state regulations to maximize exports to increase the wealth of a nation. Most countries want to export more goods than they import, implying that a country will get more income than it spends. India, maintains a high current account deficit along with a fiscal deficit.What’s the reason for a contraction in India’s CAD?

India’s CAD contracted from $19 billion in the second quarter of 2018-19 to $6.3 billion during the corresponding period of 2019-20. The data shows that this contraction is primarily because of a lower trade deficit. Also, net services receipts have increased by 0.9%. So, while imports have shrunk, exports have posted a modest growth, leading to a contraction in CAD.What about concerns regarding oil prices?

A major component of our import bill is crude. The value of our imports is sensitive to movements in global oil prices, which are contingent on geopolitical factors, besides economic considerations of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, an important player in the global oil market. Oil from Canada, Brazil and the US also plays an important role in determining overall supply and, thus, prices. Despite tensions in West Asia, prices have been subdued and are likely to remain comfortable due to the supply glut.s a contraction in CAD not a good thing?

A contraction in CAD may be good during a normal growth year, but it is a cause of concern during a slowdown. The bulk of India’s imports is for self-consumption, so their contraction is a sign of weak demand rather than of a better trade position. Low growth has led to lower imports. Once growth picks up, imports will rise. RBI should look at the value of the rupee and intervene to avoid its appreciation due to a lower CAD and net positive capital flows.

Karan Bhasin is a Delhi-based policy researcher.","India's current account deficit (CAD) reduced to 0.9% of GDP in the second quarter of 2019-20 from 2% in the first quarter, primarily due to a lower trade deficit. While a contraction in CAD is generally seen as a positive development, the article argues that it may not be a good thing during an economic slowdown. A significant part of India's imports is for domestic consumption, so a reduction in imports could signify weak demand rather than an improved trade position. The reduction in CAD could be concerning during an economic slowdown, and the central bank should monitor the value of the rupee to avoid undue appreciation due to the lower CAD.",Business and Finance
Mint,2020-01-17 00:00:00,Dhoni dropped from list of contracted players,"he Indian cricket board signalled it is ready for life without Mahendra Singh Dhoni after dropping the long-serving wicketkeeper from its list of centrally contracted players on Thursday.

The former captain quit Test cricket in 2014 and has not played for India since taking a break after the team’s semi-finals exit at the 50-overs World Cup in England last year.

Coach Ravi Shastri said earlier this month that Dhoni, who will turn 39 in July, could be considered for this year’s Twenty20 World Cup in Australia.

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), however, seemed to have made up its mind and Dhoni, who has stonewalled retirement talks in his rare media interactions, was conspicuous by his absence in the 27-player list.

In the new list, captain Virat Kohli, opener Rohit Sharma and pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah have retained their place in the A+ grade, worth ₹7 crore a year.

The 11 players grouped in the A grade with retainers of ₹5 crore include Rishabh Pant, who is seen as Dhoni’s successor in limited-overs cricket.

Mint,2020-01-17 00:00:00,Last call for relief,"Telecom companies are one last appeal away from having to cough up a bigger share of their revenue to the government in licence fees and spectrum usage charges after the Supreme Court rejected their petition for a review of its order. Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and others still have recourse to a curative plea before the 23 January deadline for those payments, which these companies are likely to use, considering the huge sums involved.

The government has tried to ease their burden by agreeing to accept deferred payments, although it hasn’t relented on demands for a waiver of the penalty and interest charges. It is likely that money for the payments will have to be arranged. Bharti Airtel has already sold a chunk of equity, while Vodafone Idea is believed to be weighing its options. Like Jio, the two have also raised user tariffs, so the extra revenue should offer them a cushion. Their other challenge, however, is to get the funds needed for a shift to 5G services. The testing norms for equipment seem unduly burdensome, and the reserve prices proposed for an upcoming auction of airwaves look too high. A thriving sector calls for lower base costs.

The Economic Times,2013-09-16 00:00:00,Indian exports set to grow 24% in the four months to December: FIEO report ,"NEW DELHI: India’s double-digit exports growth story, which has helped the rupee stage a remarkable recovery and ease current account deficit worries, is likely to get even better in the coming months, according to a government-commissioned assessment of the order books of exporters.

Outbound shipments of goods are projected to grow nearly 24% in the four months to December, and by about 16% during the entire 2013-14 fiscal, helped by a recovery in developed countries and newfound competitiveness because of nearly 15% rupee depreciation in the current financial year.

The Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO), a government-backed industry grouping, has estimated exports at $121 billion in the last four months of the calendar year, versus $97.6 billion in the same period last year. FIEO’s numbers are based on order book estimates until December. The commerce department had asked it for an on-the-ground report.

“Seventy percent of the projection is only based on the order books of the exporters till December. Measures announced in the revised FTP (foreign trade policy), and rupee fall will yield a positive result. The low base of last year will also contribute to high growth,” said Ajay Sahai, CEO and director general, FIEO. Exports rose 11.6% in July and 13% in August, helping to narrow the trade deficit to a less worrying $12 billion a month from $20 billion earlier. Last year’s $196-billion record trade deficit pushed the current account deficit to a high of 4.8% of GDP, dragging the rupee all the way down to 68.81 to the dollar.
The Indian currency has been strengthening over the past two weeks and ended at 63.48 to the dollar on Friday.

“We are happy. Exports may actually touch $335 billion, growing at the current pace,” said a commerce department official. India’s exports traditionally rise in the September-December period because of Christmas, spring and summer demand in the US and Europe, markets that together account for India’s 30% of exports.Weak demand from those regions led to exports declining 4.7% last year. But that’s likely to turn around with the US economy growing 2.5% in the quarter ended June, better than the 1.7% growth initially estimated. The euro zone emerged from recession after nearly two years, growing 0.3% in the second quarter of 2013.

Engineering has led the rise. India’s third-biggest export sector that contracted in July when overall exports rose 11.6%. Engineering exports are expected to rise a cumulative 22% in the four months starting September to $21.5 billion against $17.1 billion last fiscal. These exports, which don’t benefit much from rupee depreciation because of the high import content, rose 2% in August.


The industry is divided about prospects in the coming months. “We are expecting a growth of about 10% only,” said Aman Chadha, chairman, Engineering Export Promotion Council. Steel, which contributes about 60% to engineering exports, now costs 8% more, he pointed out. Sanjay Budhia, MD of the Patton Group, is more optimistic.

“Engineering exports may very well see an over 20% growth for these four months,” he said. “Our company is expecting about 16% growth, and are also getting enquiries from US and EU for some new products, for which we have sought DGFT’s intervention for incentives.” DGFT is the Directorate General of Foreign Trade.","According to a government-commissioned assessment of Indian exporters' order books, the country's double-digit export growth is expected to continue, with a projected 24% growth in outbound shipments of goods over the four months to December and approximately 16% growth for the entire 2013-14 fiscal year. This growth is attributed to a recovery in developed countries and a nearly 15% depreciation of the Indian rupee in the current financial year. The Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) estimates that exports will reach $121 billion in the last four months of the year, compared to $97.6 billion during the same period in the previous year.

Factors contributing to this positive outlook include measures announced in the revised foreign trade policy, the rupee's depreciation, and a favorable base from the previous year. The strengthening Indian currency and improved economic conditions in the US and the Eurozone have also contributed to this growth. Engineering exports, which are the third-largest export sector in India, are expected to rise by 22% in the four months starting September. However, opinions within the industry vary, with some expecting only a 10% growth due to factors like rising steel costs. Nevertheless, overall, the Indian export sector appears poised for a significant upswing in the coming months.",National News

Mint ,2020-01-20 00:00:00,"FIIs, MF investors play a different tune on equities","The Sensex crossed 42,000 last week. In April-December, the net investment made by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) in stocks and retail investors in equity mutual funds (MFs) has been similar. Yet data suggests they have gone in different directions. Mint takes a look.s the trend different for FIIs, MF investors?

The chart above shows that in April, FIIs bought stocks worth ₹21,193 crore. Equity MFs saw an investment of ₹4,609 crore in that month. FII investments then kept falling every month till August, when FIIs sold stocks worth ₹17,592 crore. Investments in equity MFs, however, kept growing till August, peaking at ₹9,152 crore in that month. From August onwards, the trend reversed again. FIIs started increasing their investment in stocks and investment in equity MFs started to fall. In November, FIIs invested ₹25,231 crore in stocks, while equity MFs saw an investment of just ₹1,312 crore.What does this tell us about their thinking?

FIIs have net-invested ₹54,183 crore in stocks till December this fiscal. The net investment in equity MFs is an almost similar ₹53,391 crore. Despite this, FIIs and investors of equity MFs have gone in almost opposite directions. To put it more succinctly, when FII selling reached its peak in August, equity MFs saw their highest investment so far this fiscal. In the early part of the fiscal, FIIs were clearly worried about the high price-to-earnings ratios of Indian stocks. In May, the price-to-earnings ratio of Sensex stocks peaked at 28.4. As FIIs sold stocks in July and August, the price-to-earnings ratio fell to 26 in August.What made FIIs positive on Indian stocks post August?

In August, the US Federal Reserve started printing money again to pump up the US economy. This drove down interest rates in the US. Money was available at lower interest rates. FIIs could borrow this money and invest it in Indian stocks, which is precisely what they did. The easy money policy that became popular after the financial crisis of 2008 made a comeback.What is the Fed’s easy money policy?

In the years after the financial crisis of 2008, the US Federal Reserve printed money and pumped it into the financial system by buying government bonds and mortgage-backed securities. The idea was that with more money in the financial system, interest rates would fall and people would borrow and spend again, in the process the US economy would recover. As the Fed bought bonds, the size of its balance sheet expanded from $900 billion in late 2008 to around $4.5 trillion in early 2015.What has changed in the Fed’s policy?

Since October 2017, the Fed started to suck out the money that it had printed and pumped into the financial system by selling bonds it had bought. In the process, the balance sheet of the Fed shrunk to around $3.8 trillion by August 2019. It has since expanded to $4.2 trillion. It is this newly created money that has made FIIs invest in Indian stocks all over again, since August. Meanwhile, the net investment in equity MFs has come down.

Vivek Kaul is an economist and the author of the Easy Money trilogy.","Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) and retail investors in equity mutual funds (MFs) in India have exhibited different investment trends in the past year. While both FIIs and equity MF investors have made similar net investments, their behavior has varied. FIIs were concerned about high price-to-earnings ratios in Indian stocks at the beginning of the fiscal year, leading to a decrease in their stock investments. However, following a change in the US Federal Reserve's easy money policy, FIIs began to invest more in Indian stocks, while equity MF investors decreased their investments. The easy money policy is influenced by the US Federal Reserve, which can affect interest rates and investors' decisions",Business and Finance

It means Queen Elizabeth II’s grandson Harry and his wife Meghan will stop using the titles “royal highness”—the same fate that befell his late mother Princess Diana after her divorce from Prince Charles in 1996.

“I recognize the challenges they have experienced as a result of intense scrutiny over the last two years and support their wish for a more independent life,” the 93-year-old monarch said in a statement.

Mint probes how smartphones are hacked.How have attackers exploited WhatsApp?

A large amount of data was exfiltrated from Bezos’s phone within hours of the attack, the report said. Targeting users by sending a video message or making a call was common in 2019. The Pegasus spyware attack, which targeted 1,400 people globally, was executed via a WhatsApp call. Attackers gained real-time access to a phone’s camera, microphone, storage and location. In November the Indian government’s cyber-security agency warned WhatsApp users about another attack, where a device was infiltrated by sending an MP4 video file. Spyware attacks can also be carried out by sending a malicious link via email or SMS.Why should users be watchful of apps?

A common vector for malware on smartphones are malicious apps from third-party stores. Some of these apps have occasionally been found on Play Store too, despite Google’s strict vetting process. Many of these apps use advanced obfuscation techniques such as encrypting the malicious file to avoid detection. Once installed, such an app would ask targets for accessibility rights, so it can plant a “back door” on the device and send critical data to a remote server. Not all malware go after personal data; many hack the phone for cryptojacking, which can have serious consequences for the battery and motherboard.How can attackers target you through OTA updates?

Attackers have found a new phishing attack to target Android devices. They first send an SMS with a fake OTA (over the air) update offering the target new network configuration settings. Once these settings are downloaded, attackers can route all internet traffic originating from the phone through a proxy server controlled by them, and, thus, monitor all online activity.What are the routes taken by malware?

Not all malware target users via links, messages and apps. Unique ones like BlueBorne can spread through airwaves using Bluetooth connectivity and to other devices using the same modus operandi. Connecting to a public WiFi network is risky. These networks can be used to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks, where any information passing between the smartphone and the network can be seen by attackers. Charging a smartphone using a USB port at a public kiosk can also make it vulnerable to attacks.What are the routes taken by malware?

There are many other ways in which a smartphone can be hacked, but the ones cited are more common. Attacks are not limited to Android devices, so the numbers are a lot higher. Android devices run on open source code, which lets owners tinker more with the operating system (OS). Customizations by phone makers can also weaken the security. In contrast, Apple doesn’t release source code for iOS with developers, which restricts iPhone owners from modifying the code on their phones.","Smartphones can be vulnerable to various types of cyberattacks. Attackers often exploit vulnerabilities in messaging apps like WhatsApp, using malicious video files or calls to target users. Malicious apps, especially from third-party stores, can also pose a threat. In some cases, attackers use phishing attacks through fake OTA (over-the-air) updates. Public Wi-Fi networks and shared charging kiosks can make devices susceptible to hacking. While most devices can be targeted, Android devices, due to their open-source nature, are more prone to attacks than iOS devices.

Different batting positions require different skills and approaches. The openers take advantage of the hard new ball flying off the bat and fielding restrictions. The ideal No. 3 is somebody like Virat Kohli with the range to anchor the innings. Numbers 4 and 5 need the flexibility to adapt to the situation when they come in. Lower down the order come power-hitters, who can help the team finish off on a high. Fitting the right people to these roles requires a clear strategy. The players also need clarity about their roles so that they prepare for them, both mentally and in practising their shots.What should be the Indian line-up?

Shikhar Dhawan’s performance against Australia before he got injured marks him as India’s T20 World Cup opener, although K.L. Rahul will partner the redoubtable Rohit Sharma against the Kiwis. After Dhawan returns, Rahul should drop to No. 4 and shut that revolving door. He’s a strokemaker par excellence with the temperament to hold down the position. That will leave No. 5 up for grabs between Shreyas Iyer, Manish Pandey and others. Rishabh Pant has the firepower India needs at No. 6. Ravindra Jadeja or Hardik Pandya, when he returns, would be the other hitman at No 7.Which was the world’s best batting line-up?

The 1975 World Cup-winning West Indies team had a dream line-up: Roy Fredericks and Gordon Greenidge at the top, followed by Alvin Kallicharran, Rohan Kanhai, Clive Lloyd and Vivian Richards. Australia in the noughties come second. Adam Gilchrist and Mathew Hayden opened. Then came Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke, Andrew Symonds, Mike Hussey and Shane Watson.Is there a batting order based on pitches?

A flexible mindset can work, if it doesn’t degenerate into the kind of tinkering that unsettles the team. A move that worked is Sunil Gavas-kar demoting himself to make Ravi Shastri the sheet anchor at the top. That was a masterstroke in bowler-friendly conditions of Australia and helped India win the 1985 World Series. Match situations also call for flexibility. M.S. Dhoni promoting himself ahead of Yuvraj Singh to blunt Sri Lanka’s Muttiah Muralitharan in the 2011 World Cup is folklore. But India’s rotating No. 4 now has been unsettling.s there a case for settling key positions?

Ever since Ajinkya Rahane’s ODI form declined, India’s No. 4 slot has been a game of musical chairs, so much so that nobody has had a fair chance to make the position his own. Even Kohli dropped down to No. 4 before better sense prevailed. Rahul’s versatility makes him the best candidate, but he keeps getting bumped up the order to open every time Dhawan misses out. He looked jaded in the last ODI against Australia when he had to open after keeping wickets.

Sumit Chakraberty is a consulting editor with Mint.","The success of a cricket team in T20 cricket depends significantly on the performance of its batting lineup. A well-thought-out batting order with players assigned specific roles and responsibilities is crucial for the team's success. Openers need to capitalize on the new ball and fielding restrictions, while the No. 3 batsman should anchor the innings. Numbers 4 and 5 need to be flexible and adapt to the situation, and the lower order should consist of power-hitters who can finish strongly.

For India's T20 lineup, Shikhar Dhawan, K.L. Rahul, and Rohit Sharma could open the innings. Once Dhawan returns, Rahul can move to No. 4. No. 5 remains open for competition between Shreyas Iyer, Manish Pandey, and others. Rishabh Pant can provide firepower at No. 6, with Ravindra Jadeja or Hardik Pandya at No. 7. Flexibility and a clear strategy are key to a successful batting order.

Some of the best batting line-ups in cricket history include the 1975 West Indies team with players like Roy Fredericks, Gordon Greenidge, Alvin Kallicharran, Rohan Kanhai, Clive Lloyd, and Vivian Richards. Australia in the early 2000s also had a formidable lineup.

While conditions can influence batting orders, flexibility should not lead to unnecessary tinkering that disrupts team stability. It's important to have settled positions, such as the crucial No. 4 spot. Ajinkya Rahane's decline in ODI form and frequent changes in the No. 4 position have been unsettling for India. Finding the right player for this role, like K.L. Rahul, and sticking with it is important.

Chandrachud on Monday referred the challenge to the validity of the electoral bonds scheme, which facilitates anonymous donations to political parties, to a Constitution Bench of five judges.During the oral mentioning hour, the Chief Justice said the court had received a plea to refer the case from the current three-judge Bench to a larger Bench of at least five judges.He said the case would now go before a five-judge Bench due to “importance of the issue”.The court said the case would, as scheduled in an earlier hearing on October 10, be listed before a five-judge Bench on October 31.

Mint,2020-01-27 00:00:00,"Gen Rent is here, and it’s not keen on buying houses","Is it the right time to a buy a house? Or is renting a better option? The answer, like most things in economics, is that it depends on what you want of the house. Do you want to live in it? Or are you looking at it as an investment? Mint takes a detailed look.Should you buy a house or rent one?

The rental yield on housing is largely 1.5-2%. Rental yield is the annual rent on the house divided by its market price. On the other hand, the interest paid on a home loan is 8-8.5%. Hence, financially, renting a home is almost a no-brainer. The rent on a home is likely to be around one-fourth of the EMI. Having said that, there are advantages to owning a home. It gives the homeowner a permanent address, something that seems to be becoming more and more important in the times that we live in. Also, if children attend school in a particular locality, changing homes every few years doesn’t make sense.When is the right time to buy a home?

If one plans to live in it, then buying a home, as long as one can afford it, is never a bad idea. For example, you want to buy a home priced at ₹50 lakh. Typically, you will need to make a down payment of ₹10 lakh or around 20% of the home loan. The bank will be willing to lend you the remaining ₹40 lakh. At 8% interest and a tenure of 20 years, the EMI works out to ₹33,458. It is best that this EMI should not be more than 40% of your take-home salary. If the home loan EMI works out to be greater than 40% of your take-home salary, then you will be stretched for money sooner rather than laterHow about buying a house as an investment?

Buying a house as an investment is best avoided. Returns on homes have been mediocre of late. The National Housing Bank’s housing index Residex tracks housing prices in 50 cities. Between June 2013 and June 2019 (the latest data available), Residex has given a 4.8% return per year. This is an average of the returns in all 50 cities over the six-year period.So, real estate returns have been low?

A return of 4.8% a year, when even savings bank accounts earn a return of 6-7% every year, is barely enough to compensate for the risk involved in owning real estate. Also, owning real estate involves other expenses. Property tax needs to be paid to the local government every year. Over and above this, maintenance charges need to be paid to the building society for general upkeep. In buying under-construction property, there is always the risk of the building not being completed or the builder disappearing after some time.","The decision to buy or rent a house depends on individual circumstances and goals. From a financial perspective, renting often makes more sense as rental yields are typically lower (1.5-2%) than home loan interest rates (8-8.5%). Rent is usually around one-fourth of the EMI. However, owning a home provides a permanent address, which is significant for many, and can be practical for families with school-going children. If the goal is to live in the house, buying can be a good idea if it's affordable.

On the other hand, buying a house as an investment is often discouraged. Housing returns have been mediocre, with the National Housing Bank's Residex showing an average return of 4.8% per year between June 2013 and June 2019. This return is relatively low compared to the risk and expenses associated with real estate investments. Additionally, there have been changes in tax benefits related to home loans, making the case for buying a home as an investment less appealing.",Business and Finance

That’s what US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin advised the 17-year-old green activist on Friday, suggesting that she was clueless about how the world works. This was in response to her demand at the World Economic Forum summit in Davos that fossil fuels be given up right away. In one way, Mnuchin is right. An abrupt stop to the use of oil, gas and coal would result in an economic seizure. They are the world’s primary energy source, and an instant switchover to renewables is impossible. But he is wrong about the adequacy of her knowledge.

As Thunberg tweeted: “My gap year ends in August, but it doesn’t take a college degree in economics to realize that our remaining 1.5° carbon budget and ongoing fossil fuel subsidies and investments don’t add up.” In support, she had a graph from a United Nations Environment Programme report that placed the crisis in sharp relief.

Mint,2020-01-28 00:00:00,Airports fighting coronavirus fire with heat scans,"The aviation ministry has asked airport authorities to screen travellers flying in from China to stop the coronavirus outbreak from spreading to India. So far, seven Indian airports have set up thermal scanners at immigration counters. Mint explains the mechanics of the scanners.How do thermal scanners work?

All live objects emit infrared energy or heat. Unlike regular cameras that record light reflected by objects, thermal cameras use heat sensors that can record heat generated by the body of a person or an object to create a 2D image with differing temperature levels. When a person stands before the cameras, on the computer screens the hotter objects are highlighted with a different colour palette than the rest. These cameras can be calibrated to detect abnormal body temperatures such as over 101 degrees. Every pixel of the image has a temperature associated with it, so a higher resolution camera scan offers more detailed images.When did airports start using them?

This isn’t the first time thermal scanning is being used to screen higher body temperature related to infections that can cause an epidemic. During the 2002-03 outbreak of SARS virus, airports in Singapore and China deployed them and have been using them since. Mumbai was one of the first Indian airports to use them during the swine flu outbreak in 2009. During the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, many countries including India used the cameras. India is said to have these cameras at its major international airports. Heat scanners at Nigerian airports was one of the reasons the African country remained Ebola-free.Why are thermal scanners used to screen coronavirus?

International airports have very high footfalls. Checking every passenger’s body temperature using thermometers can be a logistics nightmare and lead to delays at immigration counters. Thermal cameras can scan large crowds and spot people with higher temperature than the rest. Once authorities identify possible vectors, they can segregate them for further screening.How effective are thermal scanners?

Thermal cameras are effective only to the point of telling who has a higher body temperature or is running a high fever. It may not mean the person is infected with coronavirus. Additional screening systems are needed for that. Studying thermal images is not as simple as observing a camera image. It requires training and understanding of thermal colours and their patterns. As far as their effect on the human body is concerned, these cameras are safe and discreet. There is no proven risk of any form of radiation.Where else are these scanners used?

Thermal imaging tech is widely used by law enforcement agencies and militaries across the world. It was first used during the Korean War in 1950-53 to detect enemy soldiers in the dark. Firefighters in the US are known to use them to find people through dense smoke. In 2019, police in Minneapolis used them to detect and nab a gang of car thieves in the dark. Companies in the manufacturing and automotive sectors also use thermal cameras to check machines and equipment that might be at risk of catching fire.","Thermal scanners are being used at several Indian airports to screen travelers arriving from China in an effort to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. These scanners work by detecting the infrared energy or heat emitted by live objects.

Mint,2020-01-27 00:00:00,Spare our safety net,"A report published by the World Bank suggests that the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) may have had the unintended effect of forcing children out of school. According to the report, India’s rural jobs scheme, which promises an annual 100 days of low-skill work to at least one adult member of every rural household, might have increased the incidence of child labour as well as school absenteeism.

That MGNREGS has led to an increase in children being made to work seems implausible. The scheme is meant only for adults, and it’s unlikely that age data could have been faked on a vast scale. Nor does it look likely that adults took on jobs and left their children to work at home or in the fields. As the scheme works as a dole in disguise, the tasks assigned are not terribly demanding. As for children missing school, this could be traced to other factors, the most salient being the tendency of the poor to overlook the eventual benefits of education. While we need to pay attention to second-order effects, it is evident that the scheme serves a worthy purpose. It assures the rural poor a living. That, in itself, is quite a big deal.","A report from the World Bank suggests that India's Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), which provides low-skill work for rural adults, may have unintentionally increased child labor and school absenteeism.

Furthermore, children missing school can be attributed to various factors, including the tendency of impoverished families to prioritize immediate economic needs over long-term education.

Mint,2020-01-30 00:00:00,"Banks score with personal loans, but it’s risky biz","India’s banking crisis, driven by high NPAs, has persisted for 6-7 years. During this time banks shifted to giving unsecured credit for personal loans, away from asset-backed secured lending. Many fear a bulk of these loans could be to subprime borrowers. Mint analyses the trend.What is a subprime borrower?

A subprime borrower has a higher chance of defaulting on a loan. Typically, subprime borrowers have lower credit ratings and may have delinquencies in their credit record. A lower credit score does not automatically imply that a subprime borrower would be unable to source credit. At the same time, lower the credit score, higher the interest rate charged by the bank to accommodate for the default risk. Many suspect that the recent saturation of the credit card market combined with severe competition in consumer lending businesses has resulted in extension of significant credit to subprime borrowers.Why are subprime borrowers preferred?

Even as corporate lending and mortgages are backed by a collateral, delay in securing those assets and recovering money through insolvency proceedings have led to risk aversion. Lenders are thus focusing on personal loans and credit cards as discretionary spending on clothes, ordering food, entertainment, travel and commuting rises. Developments in technology and the recent availability of data due to the integration of Aadhaar, PAN and bank accounts have lowered the costs of processing loans for banks. This has helped them lend small amounts as unsecured loans for personal consumption.What has been the recent trend in credit extension?

A TransUnion CIBIL report for the June quarter showed that 32% of the credit cards were issued to subprime borrowers. This coincides with a sluggish extension of credit to industry at 2.3% in the September quarter, while lending to the farm sector grew 3.7% and personal loans rose 8.9%. Bankers are preferring to give personal loans and there is demand for the same.Is there any link with the non-bank crisis?

While a major part of the NPA crisis may be behind us, fresh vulnerabilities have emerged due to a prolonged slowdown in the real estate sector. Non-banks were often the front runners in providing last-mile availability of credit and the recent liquidity crisis has provided an opportunity for banks to try and get a share of the personal loan space. This can have positive implications for the sector and the economy as it can deepen the financial services industry, thereby benefiting the financial system.What does it mean for the future of banking?

While financial services and banking would continue to grow in India as per capita income rises, much of the next stage of growth would come from servicing last-mile consumers. It could even be in financing of smaller size, short- duration loans. The policies seem conducive for the securitization industry. While a clean-up of the banking system was necessary, stiff competition could lead to some banks taking unmanageable risks on their balance sheets.

Karan Bhasin is a Delhi-based policy researcher.","In recent years, India's banking crisis, primarily driven by high non-performing assets (NPAs), has led banks to shift their focus from secured lending to unsecured credit for personal loans. This change has raised concerns about a substantial portion of these loans going to subprime borrowers – individuals with a higher risk of loan default due to lower credit ratings and past delinquencies. Subprime borrowers typically face higher interest rates to account for the elevated default risk. While competition in consumer lending and developments in technology have facilitated lending to subprime borrowers, many fear this shift may pose risks to the financial system. In the future, the growth in the Indian banking sector is expected to come from servicing last-mile consumers, possibly through smaller, short-duration loans.",Business and Finance

Mint looks at what to expect in the budget for the year starting 1 April.When we fall asleep, where do we go—a song by Billie Eilish, Grammy winner for Album of the Year.

WHY IS THIS BUDGET SO IMPORTANT?

The series of announcements made by the finance minister post August to revive growth have raised hopes of a “dream” budget that would kick-start the Indian economy. This budget comes at a time when we are witnessing a consumption slowdown, accumulation of stress in the financial sector, low levels of private investments, a prolonged period of stagnation in the real estate sector and revenue shortfalls on the fiscal front. The electoral mandate of 2019 combined with the government’s ability to take tough decisions as witnessed over the last few months has led many to believe this could indeed be a historic budget. The recent decision to privatize select public sector undertakings, including national carrier Air India, hints that Sitharaman may make path-breaking announcements.

What should be the points of focus?

Though many are anticipating a big-bang budget, it would be wise to realign our expectations given the constraints faced by the government. For starters, this budget must focus on addressing the financial stress in India’s banking and financial services sector, particularly shadow banks. This would require a US-like Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which infused billions of dollars into the system by purchasing toxic assets. Addressing the weakness in consumption, which is partly due to the liquidity squeeze that gripped non-bank lenders, is critical for the revival of economic growth. Equally important would be to boost confidence and revive economic sentiment through taxation reforms. The recent tax revenue shortfalls provide the government little room to raise expenditure without widening our deficits. Thus, the extent of fiscal measures would depend on a political economy call regarding the fiscal deficit and medium-term fiscal consolidation plan.

a tax cut or higher govt spending?

This is again an area where there is limited consensus. Some experts have argued the need to give a boost to rural consumption, which would require the government to increase its expenditure on schemes such as MGNREGA, PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi and/or increase outlays on development of rural infrastructure. Others argue the need to consider rationalization of direct taxes combined with an overall direct taxation reform. This comes against the backdrop of the historic corporate tax cut in September. The argument in favour of a tax cut is that the current peak tax rate is 17% higher than our current corporate tax rate and a tax reform would additionally revive sentiment, which could lead to further revival of discretionary consumption.

will there also be higher outlays?

It is possible that the government prepares a comprehensive stimulus package that focuses on tax reform by implementation of the proposed Direct Tax Code. Alternatively, the long-term capital gains tax (LTCG) may be removed from equity considering that we already have the securities transaction tax and the LTCG imposition has mostly led to confusion rather than helping the government’s kitty. LTCG for other assets may be streamlined and the dividend distribution tax levied at the recipient’s level. Tax rationalization would require a rejig with tax slabs combined with a reduction in the tax rate. An ideal taxation reform for personal income tax would eventually have just three rates. Additionally, the government could create a special package for the agricultural economy comprising investments in rural roads, irrigation and warehousing.

what about concerns on inflation targeting framework?

A key issue highlighted during the current economic slowdown was the role played by monetary policy since the introduction of the inflation targeting regime. Many have argued that our monetary policy has been too tight for several years and this could have caused the non-bank crisis. The inflation targeting regime has come into serious question as many believe that the current framework is not the best one for a developing economy like India. Though a monetary policy framework review is due in 2021, the term of the present monetary policy committee (MPC) members ends in September 2020. Therefore, it makes sense to review the framework in 2020 rather than in 2021 so that we can make changes as necessary before appointing the new MPC members.

What about other economic reforms?

Recent steps towards a new labour code, privatization and corporate tax cuts indicate a new direction of economic policymaking and, therefore, we should expect some other important reforms in the budget such as allowing Indian firms to list abroad without having to list in India. The government should also consider selling its Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India (SUUTI) holdings, which will further help the government raise non-tax revenue. There could also be amendments in the Special Economic Zones Act, which are in line with the recommendations of the of the Baba Kalyani committee. Recommendations by several high-level advisory groups may also be part of the reforms package as we look to become the desired destination for companies leaving China.

What could be the shape of an Indian version of TARP?

A TARP-like programme is necessary to clean up the balance sheet of several of our non-banks to ensure availability of last-mile credit. A similar programme was launched by the US Fed in 2008 when it provided cheap capital to several banks for a specified period with the expectation that banks would resume lending. A similar clean-up is required for India’s non-banks, which have accumulated bad assets, especially related to the real estate sector. While such a programme is indeed required, it would require a specialized institution to execute the same. Several public sector banks have their asset reconstruction companies, which can be used for the creation of a special purpose vehicle that is open to foreign investments.

Will TARP be enough given the state of the real estate sector?

The fundamental problem in the real estate space is lack of demand. Therefore, while TARP would help non-banks, the real estate sector needs adequate policy support. The government recently announced a scheme to help complete unfinished projects and a further extension of this scheme is possible. A key policy instrument could be to let real estate firms use their CSR funds for completion of unfinished projects by other builders. Additionally, we may witness a reduced rate of interest on home loans. Another important point is that though the government may implement the Direct Tax Code, which advocates for a removal of exemptions, it may keep some exemptions to encourage savings. So, a higher tax exemption for those with home loans is possible even if the Direct Tax Code is implemented.

Should the government go for a fiscal stimulus?

The answer to this question isn’t clear as there are strong arguments both for and against it. Those against it argue limited fiscal space with the government and discuss the off-budget borrowings, which reveal a higher-than-stated deficit. Their argument also highlights the impact of higher borrowings on government bond yields, which may increase the cost of borrowings for the private sector. Others point out the fact that our current growth slowdown is a classic demand slowdown and as consumers cut back on spending, the government should increase its expenditure to support growth. Robust growth is essential to meet our medium-term fiscal consolidation and public debt management objectives.

What does the budget mean for individuals, policymaking?

It is important to recognize that the goods and services tax (GST) is within the ambit of the GST Council, so we may not witness many changes on that front. Moreover, the budget is just one part of economic policymaking as several reforms such as land, labour and agriculture are outside the purview of the budget. However, there are several other reforms and policy changes that are essential for revival of our economic growth rates in the short run. More importantly, this budget would present an economic road map for the next five years and, hence, it has the potential to ensure that this decade belongs to India. It is this road map that is of most interest as it would show just how bold a government with a mandate of 303 BJP members of Parliament could be when it comes to economic policies.

Even if London gets a trade deal with the EU, the British economy would be hit.

Mint,2020-02-04 00:00:00,Budget finds it tough to escape from fiscal hole,"Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the budget for 2020-21 against the backdrop of acute fiscal stress. Mint examines if this budget has fully acknowledged the gravity of the fiscal situation or laid out a road map for corrections.

Are the tax revenue projections realistic?

The revenue and gross domestic product (GDP) growth projections in the last budget were unrealistic. The revised estimates show that the overestimation of the gross tax revenue in that budget was to the tune of ₹2.9 trillion or 1.46% of GDP. The gross tax revenue growth in 2019-20 was a modest 4%, and much less than nominal GDP growth, which the statistics ministry estimated at 7.5%. That still hasn’t stopped the budget from relying on over-optimistic growth assumptions again this time. Gross tax revenue growth for 2020-21 is projected at 12%, faster than nominal GDP growth, which is projected at 10%.

Are the fiscal deficit numbers credible?

The FY21 budget comes clean on this count to an extent. The last budget tried to hide the strain by relying on overambitious tax revenue growth projections for its fiscal arithmetic. Also, it assumed 12% nominal GDP growth, while the statistics ministry’s advance estimate came at 7.5%. This dealt a blow to the credibility of the fiscal maths and even contributed to the departure of a key bureaucrat from the government. This budget estimates fiscal deficit at 3.8% of GDP for FY20 against the target of 3.3% set earlier. The projection for FY21 is 3.5%, against the 3% target set by the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act.

What about the off-budget borrowing numbers?

The finance ministry’s age-old trick of borrowing off-budget such as through the Food Corporation of India continues in this edition. The difference this time is that all such items of off-budget borrowing have been transparently disclosed. As a result, the total borrowing reported for FY20 comes to 4.6% of GDP, more than the fiscal deficit figure of 3.8% of GDP.

Has the fiscal strain been addressed?

The fiscal hole has grown so big that the budget sought recourse to the FRBM Act’s “escape clause” for missed fiscal deficit targets. To defuse the ticking fiscal time bomb, structural corrections are required on the expenditure and tax revenue sides. However, the budget offers no concrete measures to check tax evasion or widen the tax net. Instead, it relies on one-time receipts such as dividends and disinvestment proceeds as well as borrowings from the National Small Savings Fund.

Will the higher deficit stimulate growth?

The budget offers no big growth push by way of spending. The government’s finances are so stretched that even invoking the “escape clause” and letting the fiscal deficit widen haven’t opened up much fiscal space for a spending stimulus. The FY21 allocation for the rural job scheme is ₹9,500 crore less than the FY20 estimated spending. The allocation for PM KISAN has risen ₹20,630 crore. Capex is estimated to go up from 1.7% to 1.8% of GDP.","The budget for 2020-21, presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, has been closely scrutinized, particularly in light of the fiscal challenges India faces. Here are some key points regarding the budget:

Tax Revenue Projections: The budget has faced criticism for possibly overestimating revenue projections. The gross tax revenue growth for 2020-21 is projected at 12%, which is faster than the nominal GDP growth projection of 10%. In the previous budget, overestimations led to a revenue shortfall.

Fiscal Deficit Numbers: The budget acknowledges the fiscal challenges to some extent. For the fiscal year 2019-20, the fiscal deficit is projected at 3.8% of GDP, higher than the initial target of 3.3%. For 2020-21, the projected fiscal deficit is 3.5%, against the 3% target set by the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act.

Off-Budget Borrowing: The budget continues the practice of off-budget borrowing, but it has transparently disclosed these items. This disclosure reveals that the total borrowing for 2019-20 amounts to 4.6% of GDP, which is more than the fiscal deficit figure of 3.8% of GDP.

Fiscal Strain: To address the fiscal deficit, structural corrections are needed in both expenditure and tax revenue. However, the budget does not introduce concrete measures to tackle tax evasion or expand the tax base. It relies on one-time receipts and borrowings from the National Small Savings Fund.

Stimulating Growth: The budget does not provide a substantial stimulus for growth. The fiscal space is limited due to the government's strained finances. Some allocations have increased, while others have decreased.

The budget's fiscal deficit projection and reliance on one-time receipts have raised concerns about the government's ability to manage its fiscal position effectively.

Mint,2020-02-06 00:00:00,India’s electric car dreams need a Tesla-like spark,"The challenges facing the auto industry should not hold it back from showcasing its stuff at the auto expo that began on Wednesday. But it would do well to look at Tesla, which has become the world’s second most valued carmaker. Mint looks at the lessons Tesla holds for India.

Why has Tesla caught the fancy of investors?

Investors are impressed with the strong customer response in China, the world’s largest market for electric vehicles (EVs), to Tesla’s Model 3 car. The company’s plans to ramp up car-making capacity in that country as well as that of its Model Y in California have added to the lure. Elon Musk’s company plans to set up a Gigafactory in Germany, its first in Europe, and aims to roll out the first product from there next year. The company’s manufacture of battery packs, the most critical component in an electric car, at its Gigafactories in New York and Shanghai has attracted international buyers.

What was holding Tesla back so far?

Tesla has been a sort of a pioneer in the electric car segment, leaving automakers such as Toyota and Volkswagen to play catch-up. However, legitimate investor concerns such as consumer acceptance of its costly cars; the high debt, which stood at $11.8 billion as on 31 December; delays in car deliveries and quality issues plagued the company and its valuations. The business did not generate enough cash, raising concerns about the company’s ability to service its debt. Musk’s own maverick nature and his run-ins with the US regulator Securities and Exchange Commission in 2018 did not help.

What was Tesla’s last quarter performance?

Tesla’s $105 million fourth quarter profit, though 25% down from a year ago, was a surprise. Total revenues rose 2% year-on- year to $7.38 billion. For most of 2019, nearly all orders came from new buyers. The company generated $1 billion in free cash flows in the last quarter. It also began ramping up capacities at its Gigafactory in China and car unit in Fremont, US.

What does India lack in going electric?

The government has been pushing for renewable sources to produce cleaner fuels to run cars. End-user acceptance depends on several factors including affordability. India lacks in lithium, cobalt and nickel that are critical for making batteries. Private participation in mining, now being encouraged by the government, needs to increase. For this, land acquisition norms should be eased and labour laws made flexible. Another critical input is charging stations, which have to be an outcome of government-industry cooperation.

How far is India away from embracing EVs?

India has been a market for cost-conscious buyers of hatchbacks, with Maruti Suzuki India Ltd as the leader. Even as rivals have launched EVs, it continues to pitch for hybrid vehicles. That India’s largest passenger carmaker, usually proactive in introducing new concepts, isn’t yet willing to go full throttle in this direction shows India may be years away from embracing EVs. At a very optimistic level, an electric entry-level car will not cost less than ₹10 lakh, raising a question about its affordability in the Indian market.

The US Senate had a Republican majority, and the Democrat hope of ousting Trump from the White House had relied on defections by those who foresaw a threat to their public careers in backing him. It didn’t work, despite the apparent credibility of the main charge that he abused his office for his own political ends. Confident of acquittal, he hardly even bothered to defend himself properly, as if it’s usual practice to use US foreign aid as a tool to bully another country’s leader into aiding a smear campaign against a rival.

Does Trump’s triumph raise his prospects of re-election? It could. He emerges from his trial emboldened, ready to flay the Democrats for their alleged effort to overturn democracy, as he has been portraying it. The big loser here, though, is exactly that—democracy.

Mint,2020-02-13 00:00:00,How WhatsApp topped the list of billionaires,"Facebook-owned WhatsApp announced Wednesday that it has over two billion users across the world. Though WhatsApp didn’t confirm specific user numbers for India, its largest market, it had reached 400 million users in July last year. Mint takes a look.

How did WhatsApp get to two billion?

WhatsApp was founded in 2009 and entered India about a year later. Between 2009 and 2014, the company had grown to around 450 million monthly users worldwide. Its hook at the time was that of a simple messaging app that let people text each other over the Internet on their smartphones. It was an alternative to BlackBerry Messenger, which at the time was only available for BlackBerry users. In countries with cheap data, such as India, WhatsApp allowed users to bypass SMS charges while also providing a way to send richer texts, including media and voice. It offers voice and video calling, and payment services.

Who are the app’s chief competitors?

Facebook’s own Messenger is one of WhatsApp’s chief competitors. Official numbers aren’t available, but Messenger had grown to 1.3 billion monthly users in October 2019, according to data portal Statista.com. China’s WeChat, owned by Tencent, is another app that boasts of more than a billion monthly users. Other than that, apps such as Telegram and Signal, both of which stress on the privacy aspect of their services, are among WhatsApp’s competitors. But neither platform is even close to a billion users at present. Telegram had 200 million monthly users worldwide as of October 2019, according to Statista.

What issues has the messaging service faced?

The company has been in a tussle with the government over its encryption, which ensures that only the sender and receiver of a message can read it. The government wants WhatsApp to build a backdoor that enables decryption of messages. The company says that a backdoor negates the very reason for encryption.

Wasn’t it hacked recently?

Yes. Hackers used spy software Pegasus, which exploited a video-calling vulnerability, to snoop on journalists and activists in India. The hackers gained access via this software, thus negating end-to-end encryption instead of bypassing it. End-to-end encryption protects messages from being intercepted in transit, but can’t protect it if someone has access to the phone, physically or remotely. In a Wall Street Journal interview on Wednesday, WhatsApp CEO Will Cathcart vowed to defend encrypted messages.

What other services does it offer in India?

India is by far the largest market for WhatsApp globally. Besides growing its user base, the platform has also been involved in other areas. One of the major ones is payments, for which WhatsApp recently got regulatory approval. The company, acquired by Facebook in 2014, has been running a pilot programme with one million users for a while and the feature should come to others soon. WhatsApp uses the government’s Unified Payments Interface platform for facilitating transactions.

While vegans are unlikely to see any humour in Amul’s ad, it has roundly been flayed by the Indian unit of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta). “The joke’s on you,” Peta tweeted, advising the brand to “do the cows a favour and switch to making soya, almond, oat or other plant milk”.

Now, Amul is too well-established a business to take that advice. Not just a vast market of consumers, but thousands of dairy farmers depend on it, the latter for their livelihood.

This is part of the narrative on AI in the West, whose demographic profile and market efficiency differ from India’s. So said Tata Sons’ chairman N. Chandrasekaran, adding that AI should be used for purposes that raise productivity but do not displace workers. This makes sense, given India’s problem of unemployment. However, can it overcome the forces that act upon employers?

For decades, production has been highly capital-intensive despite the abundant availability of labour. Businesses find machines cheaper than putting people to work. This often has to do with our labour restrictions. Rules that make it hard to let go of workers act as a disincentive to hire more than the bare minimum. Salaries have to be paid even if sales are nil and keeping fixed overheads low can be key to staying profitable in tough times. What can be done? Hiring could pick up if the fear of companies of a permanent burden is eliminated through flexible labour policies. If they are able to expand or shrink their workforce as market conditions change, they might go slow on mechanization. Testing this out, however, won’t be easy for policymakers.

Claiming to have cracked the July 11 train blasts case, the Mumbai police lays the blame on Pakistan's ISI and several other organisations like the Students Islamic Organisation of India and Lashkar-e-Toiba.

Mumbai's police Commissioner A N Roy told reporters today that the blasts were masterminded by the ISI and carried out by LeT with assistance from SIMI. The direct involvement of Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaida has been ruled out.

Mr Roy stated that the bombs were in the form of RDX and other explosives packed in pressure cookers concealed in the luggage left in trains carrying rush-hour commuters.

According to the police chief 12 of the 23 persons arrested so far have been directly involved in carrying out the blasts. According to Mr Roy 11 Pakistani nationals were involved in carrying out these blasts.

They arrived in Mumbai in batches. The bombers were trained at Bawalpur in Pakistan and the actual conspiracy to carry out the blasts was hatched in Mumbai itself.

According to Mr Roy, the main conspirators were Faizal Sheikh, Kamaluddin Ansari, Ehtasham Siddiqui, General Secretary of SIMI, Maharashtra. Three co-conspirators are said to be absconding and a hunt is on for them, Mr Roy said.

Explaining the modus operandi of the bombers, Mr Roy said the Pakistanis arrived in Mumbai in different batches. Two of them came via Nepal while others did via Bangladesh and Gujarat. Their accommodation in the city was arranged by Sheikh in different parts of Mumbai. While some of them were kept in a flat at Malad in North Mumbai, four of them stayed at a flat in Bandra.

Mr Roy said between 15 and 20 kg of RDX was used in the blasts. The explosive was brought from Pakistan by a man called Ehsanullah, according to the police chief. Ammonium nitrate, which was also used in IED, was sourced locally.

Mr Roy said the bombs were assembled by one Mohammad Ali, one of the Mumbai-based conspirators, between July 8 and 10. The bombs were rigged together at a flat in Chembur. In all eight five-litre pressure cookers of the brand name Kanchan bought from local shops were used to case the RDX. These were then stored at Faizal's Bandra flat.

Each bomb had about 2.5 kg of RDX and 4 kg of ammonium nitrate.

The bombers were divided into teams of two — comprising one Pakistani and an Indian and the bombs were taken to railway stations in taxis before being placed inside various train compartments on the Western Railway suburban network.

Mr Roy said all the bombs were fitted with quartz timers and most of the bombers got off the trains before the bombs exploded. Only one of the bombers could not get off and died in the blasts between Khar and Bandra stations. The body of the man, identified as Saleem from Lahore, was not claimed.

Explaining the detection work, Roy said it was a ""professional, precise and well-planned operation."" Investigators got their first clue when a phone call from Navi Mumbai to a place along the Indo-Nepal border was tapped. Subsequently prime suspect Kamaluddin Ansari was arrested from Madhubani in Bihar.

Mr Roy said all the arrested men were subjected to narco-analysis tests which helped investigators piece together the modus operandi of the blasts. ""All of them were trained in Pakistan and received huge sums of money for the operation,"" Mr Roy said. He added that Faizal Sheikh confessed to having received around Rs 60 lakh from Pakistan in the past few years.","Mumbai's police Commissioner A N Roy claimed to have cracked the 11 July train blasts case and blames Pakistan's ISI and other organisations like the Students Islamic Organisation of India (SIMI) and Lashkar-e-Toiba without involvement of Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaida.

The Tribune,2004-10-01 00:00:00,Decision on oil prices deferred till Oct 15,"New Delhi, September 30
The Manmohan Singh government today asked the oil marketing companies to defer a decision on the revision of retail prices of petrol and diesel till October 15, and directed the public-sector oil firms to share the burden.

The decision was taken when Petroleum Minister Mani Shankar Aiyar called on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today with the proposal to hike the price of diesel and other petro products on the demand of oil marketing companies in view of the sharp increase in international crude oil prices.

The demand of the ministry has been rejected keeping in view the impact of hike in oil prices on inflation and implications for the Maharashtra assembly elections scheduled for October 13.

Later talking to the reporters, Mr Aiyar said “The decision to maintain the current price levels has been taken despite the spurt in the international oil prices.”

He said the government had already formed a committee to look into the excise and customs duty structure and also the revenue it would get due to the increase in crude prices.

“We will ask the oil companies to hold prices,” he said, adding that the government would have to work together to control inflation.

The oil marketing companies had submitted to the government proposals for hiking petro prices as they had suffered losses worth more than Rs 3000 crore due to the rise in the prices of international crude oil and petro products. The government has now directed the oil firms ONGC, GAIL and Oil India Ltd, which have benefited from the rise in prices, to compensate IOC, HPCL and BPCL for the losses.

Mr Aiyar claimed that the government would review the prices of petroleum products every fortnight and suggested that the Lahiri committee submit its report to the government before the next due date of revision.

The government, which is continuously monitoring international prices of petroleum products, said that while sweet crude prices were rising, the crude prices of Indian basket were ruling around the mid-August level of 42 dollars a barrel even now. Prices between mid-August and now had also fallen below the 40 dollar mark.","The Manmohan Singh government asked the oil marketing companies to defer a decision on the revision of retail prices of petrol and diesel till October 15, and directed the public-sector oil firms to share the burden after Prime Minister was called by Petroleum Minister Mani Shankar Aiyar to hike the price of diesel and other petrol products on the demand of oil marketing companies in view of the sharp increase in international crude oil prices, and the demand was rejected because it would impact inflation and cause negative implications for the Maharashtra assembly elections scheduled for October 13.

Asia visit CTBT talks with India, Pak not satisfactory","DHAKA, Sept 30 (PTI) — The U.S. President, Mr Bill Clinton’s planned visit to South Asia has been postponed as ""talks with India and Pakistan on non-proliferation have not reached a point where a visit to the region would be productive.’’

Mr Clinton’s visit to Bangladesh in November this year has been postponed, U.S. Ambassador to Bangladesh John C. Holuzman said here today.

Mr Clinton wrote to Premier Sheikh Hasina today expressing regret that he and Mrs Hillary Clinton were unable to accept her invitation to visit Dhaka, Mr Holuzman told members of the Overseas Correspondents Association of Bangladesh (OCAB).

""The President made clear that he had postponed his trip to South Asia because consultations with India and Pakistan on non-proliferation issues have not reached the point where a visit to the region would be most productive,"" he said.

He quoted Mr Clinton as saying that progress was being made in talks with these countries and hoped circumstances would permit him to reschedule his visit to the region next year.

In Washington yesterday, White House spokesman Michael McCurry hinted at the possibility of the trip being postponed but said no decision had been taken yet.

Meanwhile, media reports from Tokyo said Mr Clinton planned to visit Japan and South Korea after attending the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum summit in Kuala Lumpur beginning November 17.

WASHINGTON: The U.S. Congressman, Mr Sherrod Brown, on Wednesday termed India’s pledge to sign the comprehensive test ban treaty (CTBT) as a ""welcome and sound move"" that would ensure global nuclear security.

""India’s pledge to sign the treaty comes at great risk to its security. It has long been threatened by China’s policies of destabilisation and its assistance to Pakistan’s nuclear programme,"" Mr Brown, a member of the House international relations panel, said in a statement to the Senate.

Calling for enhanced Indo-U.S. Cooperation to ensure stability in South Asia, he said, ""we cannot rely on China and Pakistan to maintain regional stability.""

Amidst reports that Mr Clinton had cancelled a planned trip to South Asia in November, the democratic congressman said, ""I urge President Clinton to visit India this fall and I call on the U.S. Senate to ratify the comprehensive test ban treaty.""

Mr Brown, a prominent member of the caucus for India and Indian-Americans, said, ""by declaring its intent to forgo nuclear testing, India has extended an olive branch to its neighbours and the international community.""

""I believe India’s move to ban nuclear testing will lead to lessening of tensions in South Asia,"" he added.

Canada against waiver

OTTAWA, Sept 30 (Reuters) — Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha has said the possible waiving of US sanctions imposed after India’s nuclear tests would give an immediate boost to business sentiment.

But Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said he opposed any relaxation of sanctions by his country until India made clear commitment on its nuclear programme.

A House-Senate panel in Washington voted on Monday to give President Bill Clinton discretion to issue a one-year waiver of sanctions on India and Pakistan in the hopes that it would bring greater US leverage in the Indian subcontinent.

""I think it’s a very positive development,"" the Indian Finance Minister said yesterday, ahead of a Commonwealth Finance Ministers meeting.

Mr Sinha said the US sanctions had had only a limited impact.

""But even that limited impact was bad from the point of view of business sentiment, and I think the most important thing which is going to happen as the result of the lifting of sanctions is that it will immediately boost business sentiment both in the USA as well as in India,"" he said.

But Mr Axworthy, speaking to mediapersons in Ottawa yesterday, said India had to go beyond signing the comprehensive test ban treaty (CTBT). ""That’s just one of the elements,"" he said.","The President of USA, Mr. Clinton postponed his trip to South Asia because consultations with India and Pakistan on non-proliferation issues have not reached the point where a visit to the region would be most productive.

Indian Express,2017-08-25 00:00:00,Triple talaq Kerala: Divorce outside of law needs to go says,"Kochi girl Farista, 23, was a happy-go-lucky IT professional. Like every girl of her age, she too dreamt of a handsome prince and waited for him to arrive on a white horse to take her away to a dream land.
A prince, actually a doctor, did come but in a white car. She entered wedlock with all hopes and dreams. After living together for six months, he left for New Zealand to pursue higher studies, and stopped communicating with her. A month later, her worried parents approached his mother and sister who too were clueless about why he was behaving in this way. After one more month, she got an email from her husband saying goodbye in just three words - talaq, talaq talaq!
Life came to a standstill for Farista. Deeply depressed, she left her job and locked herself up inside her room. It took nearly a year for her to regain some semblance of composure after which she joined a school in Kochi as a teacher.
""I couldn't believe it when she narrated her story,"" says Smitha R, a close friend of Farista. ""If I had ever met that guy, I would have slapped him for using his religious status to just throw her away with one email. It was so unjust and inhuman and when I heard that the Supreme Court has declared the practice unconstitutional, I was very happy.""
Calling triple talaq a 'merciless act', Kalamandalam Husna Bhanu says,
""Thousands of women's lives have been ruined because of this talaq system.
We humans have only one life and why can't we respect each other, irrespective of gender? Life becomes really miserable for a woman when her man utters these three words. Nobody thinks about their life after divorce. How do they survive after the men simply wash their hands off and what about their children's fate? Under this system, a woman is treated like used tissue. Many of them get married even before they are mature enough and they get suddenly stranded. Is a woman's life a joke?"" She adds that not just triple talaq but the very idea of talaq outside court is wrong. ""I am glad that finally, the apex court is correcting a wrong done to Muslim women,"" she adds.
Many Kerala Muslims contend that triple talaq is not practiced in God's Own Country but writer Dr Khadija Mumtaz opposes this claim. ""Even in my own circle, it is prevalent. However, none of them are ready to speak up. In my opinion, the Supreme Court striking down the practice of divorcing a wife by saying talaq three times alone will not bring much change as long as the concept of talaq - a right to leave one's wife outside of the law - still exists.
The only difference will be that a husband will be required to say one talaq every three months. This privilege of the Muslim male to leave his wife without getting a legal divorce should also be banned. In this patriarchal world, is it hard to create documents to prove that he has uttered talaq three times in the stipulated intervals of time?"" asks the writer. She argues that as long as polygamy is legal, there won't be peace for women. ""Even as they wait for the divorce by saying talaq in regular intervals, they can marry another and enjoy worldly pleasures. So I don't find much to celebrate even after the order,"" says Khadija.

The Tribune,2000-01-02 00:00:00,India overcomes Y2K hurdle,"NEW DELHI, Jan 1 — There was a smooth roll over to the new millennium and no glitches were experienced due to Y2K in 11 critical sectors, including defence, power, aviation and telecommunications, the Union Information Technology Ministry said here today.

“We have come to the conclusion that there will be no long-term Y2K compliance problems in these 11 critical sectors for which the total expenditure can be estimated between Rs 1,500 and Rs 2,000 crore”, the Information Technology Secretary, Mr P.V. Jayakrishnan, said.

“The roll over was so smooth that the government did not even require to activate its contingency plan drawn up for the occasion,” he said.

The 11 critical sectors were banking and finance, telecommunications, power, civil aviation, railways, ports, petroleum and natural gas, insurance, space, atomic energy and defence.

He said the Department of Telecommunications made extensive investigation on telecom installations that included 32 networking stations in various states and union territories adding that “we found 100 per cent okay with no glitch anywhere.”

The Director-General of the National Informatics Centre, Mr N. Seshagiri, said the centre had earlier been concerned about the oil supplies from the Gulf countries due to any possible Y2K problem, but had “got confirmation that the systems there are okay.”

A senior official of the Airports Authority of India, Mr Ramalingam, said the computer installations at various airports were found to be functioning normally with several arrivals and departures taking place from within the country and outside during the crucial period after midnight.

Amadeus India, leader in travel distribution technology in the country, said its system successfully worked through the roll over.

The president of the National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM), Mr Dewang Mehta, said the preparations for Y2K and acceleration in industrial activities had enabled the software industry to register $ 2.3 billion of exports in value terms during this year.

Domestic info-tech companies got orders worth Rs 1,200 crore within India, he said.

None of NASSCOM’s 860 clientele companies, including 360 domestic ones had reported any problems, Mr Mehta said adding that “we will have to wait for two to three days to get the full report because many of the offices are closed”.

Mr Jayakrishnan said the banking and insurance companies were also not expected to experience any problems though many of these offices in the sector were closed for public till tomorrow.

The additional member of the Railway Board, Mr V. Kumaran, said the computerised railway bookings for March 1 had already commenced as no Y2K problem had been detected.

The railways process about 3.5 lakh applications for about six lakh passengers everyday in 450 locations and 2,500 terminals, he said.

He said the computer reservation system had been tested problem-free for transactions on February 29.

The official said the railways had spent Rs 4 crore involving 100 man hours for the Y2K combat operations.

He said the ministry had also taken preventive measures for the smooth running of the suburban trains in Mumbai, Calcutta and other cities.

The Tribune,2000-10-01 00:00:00,India lays claim to UN seat,"NEW DELHI, Sept 30 — India and Germany today staked their strong claim for permanent membership of a reformed and expanded United Nations Security Council.

Jointly addressing a specially convened press conference here, the German Foreign Minister, Mr Joschka Fischer and the External Affairs Minister, Mr Jaswant Singh said India and Germany were not “competitors” and would work together for the enlargement of the UN Security Council.

To a question, Mr Jaswant Singh said that “India has already said we are ready to accept the responsibility in an enlarged UN Security Council.”

Mr Fischer said India was one of the key players in the world in the 21st century and “will be one of the key elements of a stable world order”. India’s permanent membership would not only be in New Delhi’s interest but in the interest of the UN Security Council, the German Foreign Minister pointed out.

On the issue of resumption of bilateral aid, Mr Fishcher said there would be no delay in resumption of development assistance to India which was suspended after Pokhran II. The process for resumption of aid had been initiated, he said.

When pressed about a specific date for the resumption of bilateral assistance, Mr Fischer said no specific date could be given as there were internal procedures involved and the aid component was a part of the federal budget.

The German minister said Germany’s readiness to resume development assistance was part of the ongoing process of improving ties with India.

Germany was the second largest donor of developmental assistance to India after Japan rendering 400 million DM aid annually.

While Mr Jaswant Singh described his talks with Mr Fischer as “fruitful and productive”, the latter said, “we have a broad common stand on problems and issues.”

Asked to state Germany’s view on Indian concerns on cross-border terrorism, Mr Fischer said while his country was for a peaceful solution to the Kashmir problem, “terrorism is unacceptable”.

Terming the Lahore peace initiative by the Prime Minister, Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee as a “very courageous step”, the visiting minister said Germany fully supported a peaceful solution to bilateral problems between India and Pakistan.

Mr Fischer, who is here to inaugurate the German Festival in India in place of the German President, Dr Johannes Rau, who was originally scheduled to launch the event today, said the German President became ill and was not in a position to inaugurate the event. He said culture was very important for the promotion of understanding between different countries.","India and Germany staked their strong claim for permanent membership of a reformed and expanded United Nations Security Council.

Financial Express,2018-09-06 00:00:00,Andhra Pradesh to punish tax officials for unreasonable assessment,"In an attempt to minimize the harassment faced by taxpayers because of high-pitched or unreasonable assessments made by indirect tax officials, Andhra Pradesh has formed four nodal committees that will examine such grievances and upload reports online within 60 days from receipt of a petition.

The circular issued by the state government last month also provides for disciplinary action against erring assessing officers. Besides, cases which are considered high-pitched would get priority for disposal at the appellate authority, the circular said. The committees will examine an assessment order on various parameters including adherence to established facts, due diligence, assessing officer’s knowledge of various judgments and interpretation of provisions of law.

The mechanism will be applicable for cases pertaining to the GST, state VAT and CST cases. Exorbitant tax demand has often been cited by businesses and tax practitioners as one of the main problems in the tax administration, which has also been held responsible for lower ease of doing business.

“This kind of inclusive growth trajectory is the first-of-its-kind move by any state government under the regime of the GST. The entire process of marking cases, investigation and preference in appeal is a welcome concept, and it would go a long way in promoting the trust of taxpayers in the system. One hopes that similar initiative is taken up suo-motu by other state governments also,” Rajat Mohan, partner at AMRG & Associates, said.

As per the mechanism, a taxpayer can submit grievances online within 15 days from the date of receipt of an assessment order. The acknowledgment for the same would be generated online. A nodal committee will then examine the petition and ascertain if there is any case of unreasonable assessment order passed by the assessing officer. The committee’s report will then be uploaded online.","Andhra Pradesh has formed four nodal committees to address taxpayers' concerns about high-pitched or unreasonable assessments by indirect tax officials.

Hindustan Times,2023-08-21 00:00:00,"Aug 23, 6.04pm: India’s Moon landing time set...","New Delhi : The second and final de-boosting operation for Chandrayaan-3 was successfully completed, reducing the orbit of its lander module to 25kmX134km, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) said on Sunday, adding that the craft is now expected to touch down on the surface of the Moon at 1804 hours (6.04pm) on August 23.
The space agency said the lander module would undergo internal checks ahead of the planned soft landing.
Earlier ISRO had said that the touchdown would take place at at 5.47 pm on August 23. Now, it has been moved by 17 minutes.
The second and final deboosting (slowing down) operation has successfully reduced the LM orbit to 25 km x 134 km. The module would undergo internal checks and await the sunrise at the designated landing site. The powered descent is expected to commence on August 23, 2023, around 1745 hrs IST,” ISRO said in a post on ‘X’ (formerly Twitter) in the early hours of Sunday.
According to ISRO, India’s pursuit of space exploration will reach a remarkable milestone with the Chandrayaan-3 mission poised to achieve a soft landing on the surface of the Moon. This achievement marks a significant step forward for Indian Science, Engineering, Technology, and Industry, symbolising our nation’s progress in space exploration, it said.
This eagerly anticipated event will be broadcast live on August 23, starting from 5.27pm on multiple platforms, including the ISRO Website, its YouTube channel, ISRO’s Facebook page, and DD National TV channel.
“The soft landing of Chandrayaan-3 is a monumental moment that not only fuels curiosity but also sparks a passion for exploration within the minds of our youth,” ISRO said.
“It generates a profound sense of pride and unity as we collectively celebrate the prowess of Indian science and technology. It will contribute to fostering an environment of scientific inquiry and innovation,” it said.
In light of this, all schools and educational institutions across the nation are invited to actively publicise this event among students and faculty, and organise a live streaming of the Chandrayaan-3 soft landing on campuses, ISRO said.
On Thursday, 35 days after the mission was launched on July 14, the lander module of Chandrayaan-3 had successfully separated from the propulsion module.
ISRO sources earlier said that after the separation, the lander would undergo “deboost” (the process of slowing down) operations to place it in an orbit where when it’s at a point closest to the Moon (Perilune) it would be at a distance of 30 kilometres and at its farthest point from the Moon (Apolune) it would be 100 km away.
At this point, the soft landing on the south polar region of the Moon will be attempted, said officials.
At around 30km altitude, the lander enters the powered braking phase and begins to use its thrusters to reach the surface of the Moon, they said. At an altitude of about 100 m, the lander would scan the surface to check whether there are any obstacles and then start descending to make a soft landing.
Post its launch on July 14, Chandrayaan-3 entered into lunar orbit on August 5, following which orbit reduction manoeuvres were carried out on the spacecraft on August 6, 9, 14 and 16, ahead of the separation of both its modules on August 17, in the runup to the landing on August 23.
Earlier, over five moves in the three weeks since the July 14 launch, ISRO had lifted the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft into orbits farther and farther away from Earth.
Then, on August 1 in a key manoeuvre — a slingshot move — the spacecraft was sent successfully towards the Moon from Earth’s orbit.
Following this trans-lunar injection, the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft escaped from orbiting the Earth and began following a path that would take it to the vicinity of the Moon.
Chandrayaan-3 is a follow-on mission to Chandrayaan-2 and seeks to demonstrate end-to-end capability in safe landing and roving on the lunar surface.
The mission objectives of Chandrayaan-3 are to achieve safe and soft landing on the lunar surface, to demonstrate the rover’s mobility on the Moon, and to conduct in-situ scientific experiments.
The lander has the capability to soft land at a specified lunar site and deploy the rover that will carry out in-situ chemical analysis of the Moon’s surface during the course of its movements.
The lander and the rover are carrying scientific payloads to carry out experiments on the lunar surface.","The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has reached a significant milestone in its space exploration endeavors with the successful completion of the second and final de-boosting operation for the Chandrayaan-3 mission. This operation has fine-tuned the orbit of the lander module to 25km x 134km around the Moon, setting the stage for a soft landing scheduled for August 23 at 6:04 pm, which is 17 minutes later than originally planned.

ISRO will now conduct internal checks on the lander module in preparation for this crucial landing. The event will be broadcast live on multiple platforms, including the ISRO Website, YouTube, Facebook, and DD National TV channel. This achievement is not just a scientific feat but a moment that is expected to ignite curiosity and passion for exploration, especially among the youth, and promote scientific inquiry and innovation.

Chandrayaan-3, a follow-up to Chandrayaan-2, aims to demonstrate India's capabilities in safe lunar landings, rover mobility, and in-situ scientific experiments, including the analysis of the Moon's surface chemistry. This mission signifies India's growing prowess in the field of space exploration and marks an important step in its scientific and technological progress.",Science and Technology
Financial Express,2014-10-30 00:00:00,Centre hands over 627 a/c holder names to Supreme Court,"The government on Wednesday submitted to the Supreme Court the entire list of 627 Indians holding accounts in foreign banks and a status report of its investigations done so far in three sealed covers. The information was given pursuant to the SC slamming the government for not disclosing all the names as directed by it in its 2011 judgement.

A bench headed by Chief Justice HL Dattu directed that the sealed covers should be given to the Special Investigation Team (SIT), headed by retired SC judge MB Shah. It also asked the SIT to file a status report by November-end. The bench allowed the government to place before the SIT the objections relating to confidentiality in treaties signed with other nations. It posted the matter for further hearing on December 3.

The judges said only the SIT chairman and the vice-chairman can open the envelopes. Attorney General (AG) Mukul Rohatgi submitted three sealed covers, which included the governments correspondence with French authorities, a list of names of 627 account holders and details of overseas bank accounts and a status report.
He said more than half of the people in the list are Indian nationals while the rest are Non-Resident Indians. He said most people named in the list, which was last updated in 2006, have their accounts with the HSBC Bank. He said that the data was stolen from HSBC Bank in Geneva, which later reached France from where the government got the information.

The names as sought by the SC had been given to the SC-appointed SIT in June this year, the AG told the bench.

According to the AG, the government has amended the Income Tax Act to extend the limitation period to launch prosecution against invalid accounts and the deadline will end by March 31, 2016, thus all investigation has to end by that time.

Stating that there is nobody that the government wants to protect, and it has no objection to any probe, Rohtagi said that some of the accused, whose names were given by different goverments and the HSBC Bank at Geneva have admitted to having accounts and have also paid tax.

Citing treaties, the government requested the court that confidentiality about the names should be maintained. Any move to reveal the names in public without launching prosecution will choke governments efforts to get more information about the ill-gotten money stashed abroad, Rohatgi argued.

While there are no official estimates, Global Financial Integrity, a Washington-based think-tank, estimated that Indians had parked $462 billion in overseas tax havens between 1948 and 2008.

Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal has filed an application requesting the court to implead him as a party in the matter.","The Indian government has submitted a list of 627 Indians with foreign bank accounts to the Supreme Court, along with a status report of investigations.

Then there are false reports being circulated which claim that the vaccination drive may harm a particular community. There are reports of use of fat from certain animals.

I think 80% of the film and my role is real.” About F1, Lauda added, “Today, F1 is a huge sport and has gained a lot of popularity all over the world. Also, with time, a lot of things have changed, and so have the drivers. There are many new drivers today because they need not worry about getting killed. It’s much easier today, but this is a normal development for F1.”","NEW DELHI: The English translation of Peter Sauber's last name is 'clean' and that's exactly the image the no-nonsense 68-year-old owner of Sauber F1 team maintains. Beginning his life as an electrician, Sauber turned into a car salesman in Hinwil, Switzerland. The Swiss entrepreneur built up his team in his home country and has weathered some rough times over the course of 40 years. The year 2010 saw him return to the pit wall after buying back the business from BMW at the end of 2009. Sauber speaks exclusively to TOI about his journey through the world of motorsports and F1's foray into India. Excerpts: You have been involved with motorsports for over four decades now. What keeps the passion burning? Motorsport in general and Formula One in particular are a unique combination of top level, professional sports, high tech and circus. This is a combination which is unique and fascinating. What are the challenges in running a successful F1 team? Give us an insight into the life of an F1 team principal. In our case we are talking about a private team, and for us it's important to have a good infrastructure, good people and good partners who are the basis for a solid foundation. Concerning my role as a team principal, I have to say that it is maybe a bit different from some of my colleagues: I'm leading the team at the race track, but I'm not involved in the day-to-day business in the factory in Hinwil. This is the responsibility of our CEO Monisha Kaltenborn. A couple of years back when BMW pulled out of F1, It was a turbulent time for the team. What prompted you to take complete control of the team and in hindsight do you think it was the right decision? From a pure business point of view it didn't really make sense to buy the company. However, there were two aspects which were important to me. On the one hand there were many employees in the company who had spent 15, 20 or even more years in the company and had helped to build everything up. I felt responsible for these people. And on the other hand there was this high tech factory in Hinwil which would have been closed. This would have been the end of Formula One in Switzerland. And, yes, it was the right decision, because it would have been wrong not to try it. In 2008, Sauber was competing with the top two team for positions on the podium. What does the team need to do to reach that same level? During the BMW era, we were a proper works team which means that we had much higher resources. At that time the team had 430 employees compared to 280 today. And the budget was much higher than it is today. Money is no guarantee to have success, but without a comparable funding, it's not realistic to compete on the same level as the current top teams. You have been struggling to catch Force India in the middle of the field. Where do you think the team is lacking? Force India made a big step forward by the middle of the season when they were able to make the outboard blown diffuser work. That put us in a defensive position for some races. However, in Suzuka we introduced a very comprehensive aero package which brought us a significant step forward. We are now back in a position where we can fight on the same level with them. F1 is coming toIndia for the first time and your CEO — Monisha Kaltenborn — also happens to be born in India. What have you heard from her about the country and are looking forward to the opportunity to explore a new F1 destination? Obviously Monisha told me a lot about India, and I'm curious to see all that. It will be my first visit to India. I think it's very important for Formula One to be present in India. The Formula One calendar 2011 consists of 19 races in 18 countries, and I think the fact that India is part of this exclusive circle shows the importance of the country. How would you sum the progress of the team so far from last year? After BMW pulled out of Formula One we went through a very difficult time. So the first task was to get stability back which happened in the course of last year. We now have a solid foundation from which we want to move forward step by step. Last year we finished eighth in the Constructors' Championship, and now we are fighting for sixth. What are the aims of the team towards the end of season ? By the middle of the season we were in sixth position with quite a big gap to Toro Rosso and Force India behind us. In the meantime, we lost sixth position, and it's our clear goal to get this position back.","Peter Sauber, owner of the Sauber F1 team, discusses his long-standing involvement in motorsports, the challenges of running an F1 team, and the decision to buy back the team from BMW in 2009. He acknowledges the need for good infrastructure, people, and partners to succeed in F1. During the BMW era, they were competitive with more resources. Sauber also talks about the team's struggle to catch Force India and the recent aero package that brought them back in the fight. He expresses his anticipation for Formula One's entry into India and the importance of this new destination on the F1 calendar.",Sports

Three of them, believed to be the main instigators, were remanded to police custody for three days, while the others were sent to judicial custody until August 21. They were charged with criminal conspiracy under section 120 (b) of the Indian Penal Code. In response, Bajrang Dal activists called for a Thane bandh (strike) in protest. The mob, which belonged to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Bajrang Dal, assaulted Father Oscar Mendonca, a priest, after attending a condolence meeting. This meeting was organized to mourn the reported killings of four Sangh activists in Tripura two years earlier. Following the attack, Cardinal Archbishop Ivan Dias visited Thane, condemning the assault as a ""barbaric act"" in a civilized city like Mumbai. Many schools in Thane, including the St. John Baptist School, remained closed, and there were calls to ban the Bajrang Dal. The Bajrang Dal defended their actions, claiming they went to the Baptist Church to submit a letter protesting the Tripura killings and were provoked. They criticized the arrest of their members for two slaps while no action was taken for the alleged killing of four of their activists.",Religion and Spirituality

Indian Express,2001-08-13 00:00:00,Railway electrification signals delay,"danapur: the deadline announced by railway minister nitish kumar for the completion of the railway electrification up to mughalsarai by the end of december this year now seems impossible to meet since the colour signalling and non-interlocking works are yet to be started between danapur and mughalsarai. in all probability, the project can be completed not before december next year, said a railway official at danapur. according to sources, the contract for the colour signalling work was given to a renowned firm which completed the work only up to danapur. unfortunately, it has not yet started the third phase of the project from danapur to ara. some terms of the old contract, which were not acceptable to the firm, are said to be the reason behind it. besides, the non-interlocking (ni) work is yet to start between danapur and mughalsarai. keeping in view the time-consuming nature of the ni, it could take a minimum of one year. the ni, which requires full alertness and safety, takes one month to cover a distance of only 10 kilometres. thus the long distance between danapur and mughalsarai will certainly take more than a year, said a railway official. meanwhile, the railway electrification (re) department has declared the closing period for the danapur re office. the staff strength of the office, which stood at 750, has been reduced to 403. it will further come down to 293 by the end of december this year. it will be pruned to 200 next year to curtail expenditure. according to sources, a large number of railway employees working in other divisions of the railways had opted for the re office at danapur. as their services are no longer required, they are being sent back to their original places of posting. the decision has been taken in view of the fact that the work load at the danapur re office is not what it used to be. moreover, the danapur re office will be closed by the end of december 2002. it might continue to function for three more years if the fund for the patna-gaya electrification project is sanctioned in the coming rail budget, source said.","The railway electrification project from Danapur to Mughalsarai, initially set for completion by the end of December this year, is unlikely to meet the deadline due to delays in color signaling and non-interlocking works. The color signaling contract was awarded to a firm, which has only completed the work up to Danapur and has not yet started the third phase to Ara due to disagreements over contract terms. The non-interlocking work between Danapur and Mughalsarai, a time-consuming process, has also not commenced and may take over a year to complete. Additionally, the Railway Electrification (RE) department is reducing staff at the Danapur RE office in anticipation of its closure by December 2002, with the workload diminishing and funds dependent on the coming rail budget.

Indian Express,2001-08-13 00:00:00,Day Two at Lakme India Fashion Week,"mumbai: it's that time of the year. indian designers have gathered to pit their training, hard work and skills against each other to see who is the best. the bi-annual olympiad of the rag trade, the , is under way. fresh from new york, london and milan, the designs have now come to mumbai. yes, you read it right. many of those very designs which graced the catwalks of high fashion outlets on international ramps are now being showcased here. ``there is nothing new here,'' claimed some of the buyers, who spoke to this paper. according to them, many of the creations and designer labels showcased on the second day were `has-beens'. while some customers waited, credit cards in hand, to see what the designers would tempt them with, other than the country's fashion editors and a selection of store buyers, there appeared to be few signs of the investors who were supposed to be on the hunt for the next big thing. actually, the likelihood of the next big thing actually going bust seemed more evident. the prospect has caused a bizarre trickle-down effect. in order to stay ahead of the curve, fashion designers had decided to showcase a collection of pret-a-porter (ready to wear) lines for a target audience. the trouble was, there was no audience. every piece that was sent down the runway on the second day of the show was apparently scrutinised by no more than a few like-minded designers, colleagues from the fashion industry and models. that seemed to be it. spin doctors have been pushing fashion week as a trade-oriented event which would take on a `serious business orientation'. but there was little evidence of `serious business' as in deals translating into hard cash. so, what went wrong? nothing, claims sumeet nair, executive director, the fashion design council of india. ``the business is there. lots of big names are supposed to be coming in today,'' he said, shuffling a couple of papers. the names, though, are all under wraps. ``we do not give them out. and one has to understand that a concept such as this can only take off when the idea is established in the next four to five years.'' a senior designer, speaking on condition of anonymity, pointed out that they were treading a thin line between cult and commercial, while trying to keep a sense of cool. ``the clothes that are shown here are beautiful. these designers are on the fashion map and the word wearable has entered the lexicon of their reviews. now, we have to wait for the business,'' she chuckled. although some of the designers have been in business for years, their efforts were collectively dismissed as a ``watery collection, merely aping the west'' by an italian fashion journalist who decided to hang up his boots on the second day itself. in the fickle world of fashion, a designer is only as good as his or her last collection. the next couple of days could be make or break time.","The bi-annual fashion event, Lakme India Fashion Week (LIFW), is in progress in Mumbai, with designers presenting their collections fresh from international runways.

Indian Express,2002-06-14 00:00:00,Rift among militants in J&K widening,"NEW DELHI: Rift between local and foreign militants operating in Jammu and Kashmir has widened. Indicator to this is a recent clash between Hizbul Mujahideen and Lashkar-e-Taiba cadres, leading to eight deaths- six belonging to Hizbul group and two to LeT in Marwa in Doda district.Intelligence sources said on Friday, that there were clashes earlier too but the recent clashes indicate a wider rift among militant groups like the Hizbul Mujahideen based on local supporters and the Lashkar-e-Tabia groups comprising primarily foreign elements. ""Ever since the Pakistan based United Jehadi Council issued an order on January 12 this year, that all external militant groups will try to infiltrate local ''Tanzims'' (militant outfits based in Jammu and Kashmir) and will work under the command of local leaders, the differences between groups have been growing,"" a senior home ministry official told the <span style="""" font-style:="""" italic="""">Times of India</span> on conditions of anonymity. With local leaders calling the shots has led to a lot of heart burning among the foreign mercenaries and militants operating in Jammu and kashmir. The LeT which largely comprises such elements considers the Hizbul and other local elements unfit to carry on the jehad. ""The so called local militants are not cut out to carry out jehad,"" a captured foreign militant had told a security official recently. Although the exact cause of the Doda clash between LeT and Hizbul was still not known, sources said that Marwa in Doda district is a dense interior area with Peer Panjal on the one side and Anant Nag on the other. There is less presence of security forces here as a result the militant groups find it a resting or peaceful place for hiding safely in the difficult terrain. Traditionally in this area tussle for supremacy among militant outfits has been going on. The January 12 order from across the border has ignited the fire further, sources said. In the past financial matters, influence on local population and some times even ego tussle over a local girl had been the sources of inter and intra fights among different militant outfits. The rift between LeT and the Hizbul began with the then Hizbul leader, in the valley Majid Dar unilaterally declaring ceasefire in July 2000. This announcement was vehemently opposed by Pakistan based LeT militant outfit and also Pakistan based Hizbul leader Salah-Ud-din as well. Pakistan government''s announced resolve to check militant infiltration from the other side, has apparently dipped the flow of infiltration and has even brought about some gap in communication among the militant ranks causing lack of clear directives here from their Pak based high commands. Ofcourse the Pakistan Jamat-e-Islami chief Rashid Qureshi has contradicted Pakistan President Parvez Musharaff''s announcement and has asserted that jehad will continue and militants from there will continue to infiltrate into Kashmir. In time to come this rift among local and outside militant outfits is like to widen further, sources stressed.","Tensions are escalating between local and foreign militants in Jammu and Kashmir, as exemplified by a recent clash between Hizbul Mujahideen and Lashkar-e-Taiba operatives, resulting in eight casualties. The conflict is attributed to differences between groups like Hizbul Mujahideen, mainly composed of local supporters, and Lashkar-e-Taiba, comprising foreign elements. The discord has been exacerbated by orders from the United Jehadi Council in Pakistan, instructing foreign militant groups to collaborate with local outfits under local leadership. This shift has created resentment among foreign militants, who consider local counterparts unfit for jihad. The rift's exact cause in the Doda clash remains unclear, but the struggle for supremacy among militant groups in the region has historical roots.",Politics

Indian Express,2001-08-13 00:00:00,Day two at Lakme Fashion Week,"mumbai: it's that time of year again. indian designers have gathered to pit their training, hard work and skills against each other to see who is the best of the best. the bi-annual olympiad of the rag trade, the lakme fashion week, is under way. fresh from new york, london and milan, the designs have now come to mumbai. yes, you read it right. many of those very designs which graced the catwalks of high fashion outlets on international ramps are now being showcased here. ``there is nothing new here,'' claimed some of the buyers, who spoke to this paper. according to them, many of the creations and designer labels showcased on the second day were `has-beens'. while some customers waited, credit cards in hand, to see what the designers would tempt them with, other than the country's fashion editors and a selection of store buyers, there appeared to be few signs of the investors who were supposed to be on the hunt for the next big thing. actually, the likelihood of the next big thing actually going bust seemed more evident. the prospect has caused a bizarre trickle-down effect. in order to stay ahead of the curve, fashion designers had decided to showcase a collection of pret-a-porter (ready to wear) lines for a target audience. the trouble was, there was no audience. every piece that was sent down the runway on the second day of the show was apparently scrutinised by no more than a few like-minded designers, colleagues from the fashion industry and models. that seemed to be it. spin doctors have been pushing fashion week as a trade-oriented event which would take on a `serious business orientation'. but there was little evidence of `serious business'__as in deals translating into hard cash. so, what went wrong? nothing, claims sumeet nair, executive director, the fashion design council of india. ``the business is there. lots of big names are supposed to be coming in today,'' he said, shuffling a couple of papers. the names, though, are all under wraps. ``we do not give them out. and one has to understand that a concept such as this can only take off when the idea is established in the next four to five years.'' a senior designer, speaking on condition of anonymity, pointed out that they were treading a thin line between cult and commercial, while trying to keep a sense of cool. ``the clothes that are shown here are beautiful. these designers are on the fashion map and the word wearable has entered the lexicon of their reviews. now, we have to wait for the business,'' she chuckled. although some of the designers have been in business for years, their efforts were collectively dismissed as a ``watery collection, merely aping the west'' by an italian fashion journalist who decided to hang up his boots on the second day itself. in the fickle world of fashion, a designer is only as good as his or her last collection. the next couple of days could be make or break time.","Lakme Fashion Week, the bi-annual event where Indian designers showcase their work, has kicked off in Mumbai. However, it seems the event is struggling to attract buyers and investors. Many attendees have noted that some of the designs on display are not as cutting-edge as expected, with some buyers claiming they've seen it all before. Despite the presence of fashion editors and store buyers, there's a lack of investors looking for the next big thing. The event aimed to be trade-oriented, but it has yet to show significant evidence of deals translating into business success. Organizers are hopeful that the concept will establish itself in the coming years.",Entertainment

Congress leader and scion of Gwalior royal family Madhavrao Scindia along with seven others including four journalists, died when the private plane carrying them crashed in a paddy field near Motta Railway station in Mainpuri district, 200 km from Kanpur.

Mr Scindia was to address a public meeting at Kanpur this evening as part of Privartan Yatras being organised by the Congress in Uttar Pradesh.

The 10-seater VT-6FF plane belonging to Jindal group, carrying eight persons, caught fire after it nose-dived into a field.

Among those killed were Mr Scindia’s secretary Rupinder Singh, and journalists — Anju Sharma (Hindustan Times), Sanjiv Sinha (The Indian Express), Ranjan Jha (Aaj Tak) and Gopal Bisht (cameraman). Plane’s pilot Ray Gautam and co-pilot Ritu were also killed.


Home Minister L.K.Advani today said bodies of all eight victims of the air crash had been extricated. The body of the eighth victim, Rupinder Singh, private secretary to the late leader, could be recovered about four hours after the crash as it was trapped between the wings of the aircraft, Mr Advani said.

The public meeting which Mr Scindia was to address this afternoon was cancelled abruptly while speeches were being made.

According to Civil Aviation Minister Syed Shahnawaz Hussain, the plane left New Delhi at 12.49 pm and was to reach Kanpur at 1.50 pm. However, it lost contact with the Lucknow Air Traffic Control at 1.30 pm.

Uttar Pradesh Principal Secretary (Home) Naresh Dayal said that senior civil and police officials had rushed to the site of the mishap. Inclement weather and poor visibility appeared to have been among the causes of the crash.

Senior Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar and Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit, who were to accompany Mr Scindia to the Kanpur rally, had an escape as they did not board the plane for personal reasons. Mr Scindia’s son, who was in Mumbai, is reaching Delhi.

A pall of gloom descended on Mr Scindia’s Safdarjung residence and the AICC office here after the news of the mishap landed. Congress president Sonia Gandhi, her daughter Priyanka Vadra, Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit were among party leaders who rushed reached Mr Scindia’s house.

Home Minister L.K. Advani, Minister for Law, Justice and Company Affairs Arun Jaitley also visited Mr Scindia’s residence.

Meanwhile, the Director General Civil Aviation has ordered an inquiry into the mishap.

The Tribune,2002-10-01 00:00:00,Hold Pak accountable: PM,"New Delhi, September 30
Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee today asserted that Pakistan must be held accountable for continuing to sponsor terrorism in India. He said the government would intensify diplomatic initiatives to remind the leading nations of the international anti-terror coalition partners to redeem their pledge in this direction.

“While our security forces will have to continue their good work on the ground to get the better of militancy, we will intensify our diplomatic initiatives to remind the leading nations...to combat and defeat terrorism everywhere, irrespective of the cause it espouses,” Mr Vajpayee said. He added, “Which means, Pakistan must be held accountable for its continued sponsorship of terrorism in India.”

He was speaking at the conference of DGPs and IGPs at Vigyan Bhavan, here.

Stating that terrorism had failed to find any place in the conscience of human society and that what had been rejected by society could not have an enduring life, the Prime Minister said “those who continue to support it (terrorism) will doubtlessly get isolated from the rest of humanity.”

However, Mr Vajpayee pointed out that before terrorism actually died and disappeared from the world as a political instrument, it would continue to commit many more depredations.

“Therefore, we have to become more vigilant against this menace, and more determined to stamp it out,” the Prime Minister said while lauding the role of security forces in tackling militancy in the country.

The terrorist attack on India’s Parliament House, preceded by the attack on the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly building in Srinagar, the carnage of innocent men, women and children in Kaluchak, Kasim Nagar and, most recently, the bloody sacrilege at the Akshardham temple in Gandhinagar — all these were signs of our enemy’s desperation, he said.

“Needless to say, a good part of this desperation owes to the growing successes gained by our security forces in turning the heat on terrorist outfits and infiltration from across the border...I would like to specifically recognise the signal contribution of the police in conducting successful anti-terrorist operations,” he said.

Referring to Jammu and Kashmir, the Prime Minister exhorted confidence that the state would leave the nightmare of militancy behind and return to peace, normalcy and development.

“We have seen it happen in Punjab, where the police and security forces, with the cooperation of the people, ultimately overcame the challenge of militancy,” he said.

Mr Vajpayee said the manner in which the people of Jammu and Kashmir were braving terror and participating in the poll once again demonstrated that the bullet could not defeat the ballot in a democracy.

“In Jammu and Kashmir, we had pledged to hold free and fair elections to the state Assembly. The polling in the first two rounds so far has borne out this commitment. There was a widespread fear psychosis created by terrorist organisations backed by Pakistan. There were killings of candidates and political activists, intimidation of voters, calls for poll boycott. However, the people of the state braved all this to once again demonstrate that the bullet cannot defeat the ballot in a democracy,” he said.

He added that he would be failing in his duty if he did not compliment the state police, various paramilitary forces, the Army and intelligence agencies for doing a difficult and challenging job well.","In reference to terrorist attack on India’s Parliament House, preceded by the attack on the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly building in Srinagar, the carnage of innocent men, women and children in Kaluchak, Kasim Nagar and, most recently, the bloody sacrilege at the Akshardham temple in Gandhinagar, Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee asserted that Pakistan must be held accountable for continuing to sponsor terrorism in India.

A special court in Mumbai today found film financier and diamond merchant Bharat Shah, film producer Nazim Rizvi and his assistant Abdul Rahim Allahbaksh Khan guilty of having links with the underworld.

However, designated Judge A P Bangale of the special court, constituted under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA), ruled that Shah was guilty under the Indian Penal Code and not under the special law under which he was originally tried.

Rizvi and Baksh were, however, found guilty under the MCOCA. All of them have been accused of targeting film personalities for extortion using their links with the underworld.

The judge acquitted co-accused and Dubai-based businessman Mohammed Shamshuddin alias Bhatija of the charges for lack of evidence.

The court will decide on the quantum of punishment after hearing all parties tomorrow.

The arrest of Rizvi, close on the heels of his film ‘Chori Chori Chupke Chupke’s’ release more than two years ago unveiled the lid on Bollywood’s underworld links.

After Rizvi confessed to his mob links, the police arrested his assistant Baksh and eventually Shah. The high-profile diamond merchant and financier received bail after spending more than a year in Mumbai and Thane central jails under tough conditions.

Rizvi, a small-time producer of C-grade films for 10 years, hit the big league with ‘Chori Chori Chupke Chupke’ starring Salman Khan, Rani Mukherjee and Preity Zinta. It was alleged that Rizvi and Shah coerced several of the top stars into acting for the film.

Among other things, the Mumbai police released telephone tapes of Shah’s conversations with alleged Pakistan-based mobster Chhota Shakeel.

A number of Bollywood personalities, including Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, Rakesh Roshan, Ratan Jain, Mahesh Manjrekar, Sanjay Gupta, Harish Sughand, Ali Morani, Anees Bazme and Mohammed Morani were questioned as witnesses. All of them, except actress Preity Zinta had turned hostile in the case.

The Tribune,2005-10-01 00:00:00,Ex-Akali minister’s house raided by CBI,"Amritsar, September 30
Sleuths of the CBI raided the house of Mr Nirmaljit Singh Kahlon, a former Akali Minister, in the posh Ranjit Avenue here this morning in connection with the recruitment of Panchayat Secretaries during the SAD-BJP government.

Though the CBI conducted countrywide raids on top bureaucrats of various departments, Mr Kahlon is the only senior Akali leader who was questioned by the team. His case was reportedly handed over to the CBI by the state government.

It may be mentioned that as many as 905 Panchayat Secretaries were recruited during the Badal government in 2001, reportedly on the direction of court. Earlier, the Congress Government had terminated their services.

The Vigilance Department raided the residence of Mr Kahlon, a few months after the formation of the Capt Amarinder Singh government and a case was registered for allegedly possessing assets disproportionate to his known sources of income.

Mr Kahlon, his son Ravi Kahlon and other family members were present in the house during the CBI raid. The CBI team carried out search for more than four hours. It searched beds, almirahs, trunks and beddings .

Mr Kahlon claimed that the CBI had failed to find anything objectionable. He said that he was framed in a false case with a view to settling “political scores”. He said the raids amounted to contempt of court, as the judgment in this regard had been pending in the court. Mr Kahlon alleged that attempts were being made to defame the Shiromani Akali Dal by framing their senior leaders in fabricated cases.

Moga: The CBI carried out a search operation at the Chandigarh and Moga residences of the Deputy Commissioner, Mr Mandeep Singh, in connection with the case of recruitment of Panchayati Raj Officers during the SAD-BJP regime in 2001.

According to sources, the CBI searched the DC’s residence in Sector 34-C, Chandigarh, and his official residence in Moga early in the morning. Sources said Mr Mandeep Singh was the Director of Rural Development Department at the time of the SAD-BJP government in 2001 and some irregularities were reported in the recruitment of Panchayati Raj Officers.

Sources said some BSNL employees from Moga were also present as witnesses during the operation that lasted for about four hours. The CBI had reportedly sealed the Chandigarh residence of the DC. However, no details of any seizure of documents were available.

On the other hand, the Deputy Commissioner denied that the CBI carried out any search operation at any of his residences.

Solan: Separate teams of the CBI raided the premises of various government offices and professional institutes here today. It was reliably learnt that the CBI teams today descended on the premises of the Solan College of Homoeopathy and Medicine, Chambhaghat.

While details could not be confirmed, it was learnt that the raids followed directions from the CBI headquarters to inspect the records pertaining to financial transactions of these professional institutes. Due to the reported tax evasion worth crores in various parts of the country by various professional institutes, the CBI sleuths here were examining the funds collected by these institutes.

It was learnt that 200 CBI sleuths were conducting raids in various parts of the state.","Former Akali Minister Nirmaljit Singh Kahlon's home was raided by the CBI, and he was interrogated by the investigators. Kahlon and his son Ravi Kahlon were there when the raid took place. The CBI team spent more than four hours searching Kahlon's home and looking at his assets, which were disproportionate to his salary. Kahlon asserted that the raids constituted contempt of court because the CBI had not discovered anything wrong and he was framed in a false case with a view to settle “political scores”. In connection with the hiring of Panchayati Raj Officers under the SAD-BJP administration in 2001, according to sources, the CBI also carried out a search operation at the homes of Deputy Commissioner Mandeep Singh in Chandigarh and Moga, but he claimed no such search operation was carried out.

Also, we are hoping the division is turned into a zone in itself,” said Harsha Shah, the president of the Railway Pravasi Group, on the eve of the Union Budget. Though she believes the railways’ shift towards privatisation is a “bad idea,” Shah does feel the Pune station must be developed like the one in Mumbai. “The station is in need of an immediate facelift. Trains with more than 20 coaches cannot be accommodated on all the platforms. Hopefully, there will be a mention of the station’s redevelopment plan in the budget,” she said and added that Pune must also get some high-speed trains. Since the railway ministry, in the recent past, had stressed on safety and security of train users, passengers expect to see some significant moves in that direction as well.
“The area near Lonavla, also called the shat section, may not come under the Pune division, but trains to and from Pune have been facing risks along this stretch due to landslides. In the winters and monsoons, the conditions become worse. The railways had said that a GPS-based navigation system will be set up in the trains to deal with poor visibility caused by fog.

Daily news and analysis (DNA),2023-10-16 00:00:00,How 900 Indian soldiers can face brunt of Israel-Hamas war: Know why they are placed at Lebanon border,"The conflict between Israel and Palestine has intensified and it is likely that Indian soldiers can be facing the brunt of the war against terror group Hamas. Here’s how.The Israel-Palestine conflict has intensified over the last few days, as the Israeli Defence Force (IDF) has launched multiple bomb campaigns in Gaza to eradicate the Palestine-based terror group Hamas. However, Indian soldiers can get caught in the crossfire of the war.While the Indian government is wary of the impact that the Israel-Hamas war can have on the economy and inflation across the world, there is another reason why India can get caught in the crossfire. Hundreds of Indian troops are currently deployed at the Israel-Lebanon border, where tensions between the two nations are running high.

Can Indian soldiers get caught in the middle of the war between Israel and the terror group Hamas? If tensions between Israel and Lebanon escalate, how safe will Indian troops be? Here is all you need to know about the situation.As part of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), around 900 Indian soldiers have been deployed at the Israel-Lebanon border. Not just this, but 200 Indian soldiers have been deployed between Israel and Syria as part of the UN Disengagement Force (UNDOF) at Golan Heights.The 900 Indian troops placed at the UNIFIL line have been there since 1978, and have been stationed at the Blue Line, a region which has seen an increased number of confrontations between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.

The prime purpose of the Indian soldiers placed on the Israel-Lebanon border is to maintain peace between the two conflicted countries. Earlier, the UN peacekeeping mission had announced that a rocket shell had fallen on the UNIFIL line, with no casualties reported.

India has contributed to the UN peacekeeping mission since 1948, contributing thousands of troops to the cause. However, this means that Indian troops have also been in the middle of several wars, remaining on the frontlines of other countries.

In 2022, the UN peacekeeping forces saw a total death toll of 4207 fatalities, with Indian casualties being the highest at 175, followed by Pakistan (166) and Bangladesh (160). Not just men, but women peacekeepers have also been deployed.

Since Indian troops are on the frontlines of the conflict between Israel and Lebanon’s militant force Hezbollah, it is likely that there could be heavy shelling on the UNIFIL line which could lead to casualties.","The Israel-Palestine conflict has intensified over the last few days, as the Israeli Defence Force (IDF) has launched multiple bomb campaigns in Gaza to eradicate the Palestine-based terror group Hamas.

She also said the new tax regime has been made “very attractive”, emphasising on moderation in personal taxes for the middle classes in the country. “In the new tax regime, offering a rebate on annual income of up to Rs 7 lakhs will leave higher disposable income in the hands of the people,” she added.Replying to the general discussion on Budget 2023-24, Ms Sitharaman also told the Lok Sabha that India was still the fastest-growing major economy and will continue to be so in future. She said the Budget also focuses on the middle class, employment generation, MSMEs, the agriculture sector, the rural population, health and green growth, among others. “Besides, fiscal prudence is maintained as announced in the fiscal glide path in the Budget, which astutely balances the requirement of development imperatives within the limits of the fiscal position,” Ms Sitharaman said.In the 2023-24 Budget, Ms Sitharaman has raised long-term capital expenditure by 33 per cent to Rs 10 lakh crores, continuing this government’s trend since 2014 to ramp up capital spending on infrastructure and similar sectors. The record outlay also boosted the strategy to revive growth in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic.aborating on the new tax regime, she claimed it has been made “very attractive”, emphasising on moderation in personal taxes for the middle classes and salaried people across the country. “Under the revamped concessional tax regime, which will be effective from the next fiscal, no tax would be levied for income up to Rs 3 lakhs. Also, income between Rs 3-6 lakh will be taxed at five per cent; Rs 6-9 lakhs at 10 per cent, Rs 9-12 lakhs at 15 per cent, Rs 12-15 lakhs at 20 per cent and income of Rs 15 lakhs and above will be taxed at 30 per cent,” she said, adding no tax will be levied on annual incomes of up to Rs 7 lakhs.Responding to RSP member N.K. Premachandran's remark that the new tax regime will not be beneficial for a person earning Rs 9 lakhs annually and having an investment of Rs 4.5 lakhs in tax savings instruments, Ms Sitharaman said for a person saving Rs 4.5 lakh will be an “effort-ridden exercise” and for a person earning Rs 9 lakhs, it is not always possible to have Rs 4.5 lakhs as saving and then also have enough money to spend on your family,” she said.","India's Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, has announced that the government has chosen the capital expenditure (capex) route to revive the economy, as it has a great multiplier effect.

Reiterating that the Congress is promoting love and brotherhood while the BJP is spreading hatred, Mr Gandhi described the contest between the two parties as the battle of the ideologies of Gandhi and Godse.


Addressing a public meeting on the sidelines of the Congress' ""Jan Akrosh Yatra"" at Polaykala under Shajapur district in Madhya Pradesh, Mr Gandhi said that a caste census will alone ensure inclusive development in the country, giving justice to different communities, including the OBCs.

“This (caste census) is the biggest issue before the country today. If the Congress comes to power at the Centre, the first thing the party will do is conduct a caste census and make the data on the populations of all the communities public,” he said.

Mr Gandhi claimed that the Congress government at the Centre had earlier conducted the caste census. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi was not keen to make the census data public, depriving different communities of their true participation in power.

The Pioneer,2023-10-16 00:00:00,SC to deliver on Tuesday verdict on pleas seeking legal validation for same-sex marriage Cricket among five sports included in 2028 Olympic programme,"ISRO has lined up a series of exploration missions including to Mars, Venus and to the Moon again, apart from the maiden human spaceflight programme, Chairman S Somanath said.

The space agency also has drawn up plans to launch missions for studying climate and weather conditions of the Earth, the space agency chief said, speaking to reporters on Sunday.

Besides, ISRO is also working on regular scientific missions including communication, remote sensing satellites, Somanath, who is also the Secretary of the Department of Space, said here.

Speaking about the Gaganyaan programme, he said the maiden TV-D1 test flight is scheduled for October 21.

Elaborating about the upcoming missions undertaken by the Bengaluru-headquartered space agency, he said, ""We have exploration missions. We have plans to go to Mars, Venus, again sometime to the Moon. We also have programmes to look at the climate and weather of Earth.""

Stressing that the scientists at ISRO would be focused on taking up regular missions like launching satellites for communications and remote sensing, he said scientific missions are also in the pipeline to look at issues like aeronomy, thermal imaging, and climate change impact assessment.

""So many things are there and we are very busy doing all of this,"" he said.

To a query about whether scientists were able to receive any kind of response from the Vikram lander of the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft, which successfully made a soft-landing on the surface of the Moon on August 23, he said Vikram had done its job very well during the lunar day (equivalent of 14 Earth days) at which time it was programmed to perform its functions.

""It is happily sleeping on the Moon. It has done its job very well. Maybe if it wishes to wake up, let it wake up. Until then, we will wait,"" he said. ISRO made efforts to re-establish communication with rover Pragyan and lander Vikram after they were put into sleep mode in September following the onset of night on the Moon.

""No signals have been received from them. Efforts to establish contact will continue,"" ISRO had said.

After the historic landing on August 23, lander Vikram and rover Pragyan performed different tasks on the lunar surface, including detecting the presence of sulphur and recording relative temperature.

About ISRO's maiden mission to study the Sun, Somanath said the spacecraft is ‘very healthy' and is on a 110-day long journey to the Lagrange point L1 and is expected to reach the intended destination by “middle of January.”

""It is a long journey. It is almost 110 days of journey and it has covered some distance now. We corrected a little bit of its trajectory, because early correction is important to reach the L1 point. After tracking, we find it is going in the right direction towards the L1 point,"" he said.

Observing that the rocket is on a ‘complex travel', Somanath said, ""It takes almost another 70-75 days further to reach. By the middle of January, it will reach there. After that, we will make some corrections to make it enter into the Halo orbit at the L1 point.""

""After that instruments will be switched on and it will start doing the scientific data streaming. Currently, everything is very healthy on Aditya L1,"" he said.

Aditya-L1 was launched on September 2, and it is the first Indian space-based observatory that will study the Sun from a halo orbit around the first Sun-Earth Lagrangian point (L1), which is located roughly 1.5 million km from the Earth.

Earlier, Somanath visited the residence of renowned agricultural scientist M S Swaminathan, who passed away on September 28. He met the family members of the eminent plant geneticist known as the driving force behind India's ‘Green Revolution', here in the city.

""I am here today just to pay my tributes and my affection to his (M S Swaminathan's) contribution… Whoever works in whichever field whether it is space, agriculture or sustainability and many other domains, we all find a place to work together,"" he said.

 

""Thank you so much for the opportunity. His (M S Swaminathan's) legacy will continue to inspire more young people in the country to work in science and technology."" Somanath said.","ISRO has lined up a series of exploration missions including to Mars, Venus and to the Moon again, apart from the maiden human spaceflight programme, Chairman S Somanath said.

During his address, Netanyahu issued a stern warning to Lebanon’s Hezbollah terror group and Iran, saying, “Don’t test us, you will be severely harmed.”

“Even with the passage of 75 years, the war of independence hasn’t ended,” the prime minister told the Knesset.

“We will win, because our existence here is at stake,” he said and likened Hamas to Nazi Germany. He further termed the ongoing conflict, “a war between forces of light and forces of darkness, between humanity and animalism.”

Iran threatens to open more war front

Meanwhile, Iran has once again threatened Israel to open more war fronts if it didn’t stop its attacks on Gaza. Israel has declared a war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip in response to the October 7 terrorist attack, in which more than 1,300 people were killed.

Similarly, Lebanon-based Hezbollah also has Iranian backing.","srael-Hamas war latest update: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Iran and Lebanon-based Hezbollah “not to test” Israel even as they threatened “expansion of war fronts”.

In his address to the Knesset, which was disrupted after rockets were fired at Jerusalem, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel has started learning from the failures that led to Hamas’s deadly infiltration on October 7.

“The reasons for the disaster that occurred will be investigated… and we have started drawing conclusions,” he said.

“We will win, because our existence here is at stake,” he said and likened Hamas to Nazi Germany. He further termed the ongoing conflict, “a war between forces of light and forces of darkness, between humanity and animalism.”",National News

Addressing the dedication ceremony of the new campus of the National Institute of Biotch Stress Management here through video, Modi underlined the need to promote production of crops based on local climatic conditions.
He distributed the Green Campus Award to agriculture universities and interacted with farmers of different states on innovative methods. He dedicated 35 special crop varieties with different traits.
Modi appreciated the Chhattisgarh government’s efforts to make farming more profitable and to save crops from the effects of climate change.
The Millet Mission launched in Chhattisgarh to promote millet production was the need of the hour, he added.
The Prime Minister mentioned the gauthans built under Suraji Gaon Yojna and cowdung procurement under Godhan Nyay Yojana.
He praised the Chhattisgarh government for utilizing the cowdung procured in the gauthans for production of organic manure and, now, for generating electricity.
Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel assured the Prime Minister that Chhattisgarh will have an active and extensive participation in the awareness campaign launched by the Centre for promotion of climate tolerance techniques and methods.

the pioneer,2021-09-30 00:00:00,Agriculture a better bet for Eastern India,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has recently suggested to the country’s farmers 35 new and varied types of vegetations that are of high yield or high value, or both. Among the crops the Prime Minister has suggested for futuristic agricultural development are chickpea, wilt and sterility mosaic resistant pigeonpea, early maturing variety of soya bean, disease resistant varieties of rice, bio-fortified varieties of wheat, pearl millet, maize, quinoa, buckwheat, winged bean and faba bean, among others.

Apart from prospects for India’s agricultural, this suggestion could just be the answer for a prosperous eastern India as well. In a recently published book, titled Had Patel Been Prime Minister, this author has delved into how Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, had he been the country’s PM instead of Jawaharlal Nehru, would have treated the issue of India’s economic development and particularly that of eastern India. Patel had novel ideas. He would have notionally treated eastern India distinctly for farming and agriculture. In his time, the 35 new crops suggested by our current Prime Minister might not have been known. Yet, the concept that there are plants that are drought resistant, inimical to pests or excessive rain or flooding was indeed known.

The thrust of this submission is to reiterate an important aspect of Sardar Patel’s outlook. He was from a farmer’s family and well acquainted with farmers’ issues and problems. In fact, he organised and led the Bardoli Satyagraha as farmers’ revolt against excessive taxes in the face of financial difficulties in 1928. The movement made Sardar Patel a national leader. Prior to his political career and role in the country’s independence movement, Vallabhbhai was also a prominent lawyer in Ahmedabad and not unfamiliar with industry. Moreover, he was aware that to develop eastern India, agriculture was the key, not industry.

The Seven Sisters of northeastern India, as well as people of Assam, are also comfortable with farming. Uncannily, West Bengal, truly speaking, is also similar. Prior to Independence, most industries in the State had been promoted by the British and very few by indigenous people. When the British disinvested after 1947, not a single enterprise was bought by any local entrepreneur save one, namely Jardine Henderson, which was invested in by one Gujarati from Prayagraj (Uttar Pradesh). The rest went to entrepreneurs from Rajasthan.","PM Narendra modi trying to implement sardar vallabhai patel aspect of agiculture.

the pioneer,2013-12-31 00:00:00,Section 377 will not be repealed any time soon,"Barely a week after the Supreme Court of India overruled the Delhi High Court order de-criminalising homosexuality among consenting adults, a determined group of Members of Parliament in Uganda passed a stringent anti-gay law, citing the need to protect traditional family values which are being undermined by Western-inspired gay rights groups. It is increasingly likely that nations concerned with the erosion of cultural values due to intrusive Western interference in their internal affairs; that wish to protect minors from predatory foreign tourists; and wish to have some legal leverage against Western activists frequenting their country, may find it useful to have such a law on their statute books.

It remains to be seen if the Ugandan Bill is endorsed by President Yoweri Museveni, because national and international activists have urged him not to, and because there was no quorum in the House that day (December 20). But the fact that a group of MPs resolutely moved and passed the Bill — first mooted in 2009 but withheld following an international backlash — shows that this is a festering issue in that nation, among others. Homosexuality is illegal in 37 African countries.

Uganda’s law is strong. Though the original proposal to prescribe death penalty for certain homosexual acts was dropped, the Bill provides stringent punishment, including life imprisonment, for homosexual acts. It bans promotion of homosexuality and makes not reporting gay people a crime punishable by prison sentence. Foreign tourists will not be exempt from prosecution under the new law. Speaker Rebecca Kadaga, the driving force behind the law, had promised it to the nation as a “Christmas gift”.

The West was furious. US President Barack Obama called it “odious” and said it is “unconscionable to target gays and lesbians for who they are”. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said the law would have a detrimental effect on the fundamental rights of gay members of Ugandan society and hinder the work of human rights defenders and efforts to address HIV/AIDS. It said the Bill violates the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights that Uganda has ratified. If international accords mooted by the West are used to slip in controversial agendas that supersede the laws, customs and cultural sensitivities of nations, the world may need to reconsider the utility of such accords.","A group of Members of Parliament in Uganda passed a stringent anti-gay law in retaliation to the de-criminalising homosexuality among consenting adults by supreme court the week before.

A 71-year-old Illinois man accused of fatally stabbing a 6-year-old boy and seriously wounding a 32-year-old woman was charged with a hate crime Sunday. Police allege he singled out the victims because of their Islamic faith and as a response to the war between Israel and Hamas.

In recent days, police in US cities and federal authorities have been on high alert for violence driven by antisemitic or Islamophobic sentiments. FBI officials, along with Jewish and Muslim groups, have reported an increase of hateful and threatening rhetoric.

In the Chicago-area case, officers found the woman and boy late Saturday morning at a home in an unincorporated area of Plainfield Township, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) southwest of Chicago, the Will County Sheriff's Office said in a statement on social media.

The boy was pronounced dead at a hospital. The woman had multiple stab wounds and was expected to survive, according to the statement. An autopsy on the child showed he had been stabbed dozens of times.

“Detectives were able to determine that both victims in this brutal attack were targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the on-going Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis,” the sheriff's statement said.

According to the Will County sheriff's office, the woman had called 911 to report that her landlord had attacked her with a knife, adding she then ran into a bathroom and continued to fight him off.

The man suspected in the attack was found Saturday outside the home and “sitting upright outside on the ground near the driveway of the residence” with a cut on his forehead, authorities said.",Motivated by israel-hamas war a 71 year old man killed a 6 year boy and seriously wounded a 36 year old women for their islamic faith. recently their has been an increase of hateful crimes and muslims group are threatening rhetoric. the suspect was found outside his house.,International News

the pioneer,2015-12-31 00:00:00,living in a troubled neighbourhood,"India shouldn’t take lightly the threats to its security from within and outside. Not just in border States, police forces countrywide should ginger up

As 2016 approaches, India needs to be acutely conscious of the security threats facing it. Nothwithstanding Prime Minister Narendra Modi's initiatives to ease ties with Islamabad, underlined by his emblematic Christmas stopover in lahore and warm interaction with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, India needs to keep its powder dry.

Whatever Mr Sharif's gestures, one can hardly ignore his and his brother Shahbaz Sharif's close ties with the Jamaat-ud-Dawa'h, the parent organisation of lashkar-e-Tayyeba, and their head and the architect of the 26/11 terrorist outage in Mumbai, Hafiz Saeed. Besides, in respect of India, the shots are called not by Mr Sharif's Government but the Pakistani Army, whose chief, General Raheel Sharif is implacably hostile to this country. Add to this the gains made by Pakistan by using the bulk of the aid received from the United States to increase its strike capability against this country, and India needs to not only remain alert but urgently replenish its arsenal and enhance its military capability.

Simultaneously, India needs to sharpen its efforts to cope with cross-border terrorism. While Pakistan is the obvious source, one can hardly rule out vigil on the Bangladesh border. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is a genuine friend of India and New Delhi needs to do everything it can to strengthen her position. This is particularly important because the West does not adequately realise the need to do so thanks to the utter ineptitude of Bangladesh's Foreign Ministry which has let her down badly.

The situation in Bangladesh is serious. Fundamentalist Islamist terrorist organisations like the Islamic State and offshoots of the Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh, with capacities for violence grossly disproportionate to their numerical strength, have been carrying out murderous attacks on secular bloggers and other objects of their vicious hatred. Their antipathy toward India is well known, as is the support they receive from similar elements strongly entrenched in West Bengal and Assam. Going by experience, the danger of their mounting terrorist attacks in the heart of India from the peripheries can hardly be ruled out.

the pioneer,2020-12-31 00:00:00,Age of tech,"Undoubtedly, the pandemic has accelerated tech-aided living. The question is, will human behaviour be guided too?

If there is anything positive about the pandemic, it is the fact that it led to the super-spread of digitisation and technology. Of course, we were aware of the concepts of remote learning, work from home, tele-consults, retail and online banking, tracking supply and logistics, but we had not thought that they would become the new normal in a world of house-bound protocols. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the global economy. If a McKinsey Global Survey of executives is to be believed, their companies have accelerated the digitisation of their customer and supply chain interactions and of their internal operations by three to four years. Furthermore, the study claims that the share of digital or digitally-enabled products in company portfolios has accelerated by a shocking seven years. It’s not just a jump or a leap then; it is flying on a jetpack. The biggest technology strides we have made have been largely in the education and health sectors. In what is otherwise a lost year, our school-going children have managed to get by with online classes and project modules. Agreed this was largely confined to cities and there is a digital divide but it has forced us to address our infrastructural gaps. India may be among one of the largest consumers of smartphones worldwide and may have the second largest internet penetration but we still don’t have a reliable and strong broadband connection throughout the country. Till we can ensure this, it will remain one of the major reasons for lack of access to online learning. Even in the cities, where we have a comprehensive 4G network set-up, there are major disruption issues being faced by parents, students and teachers alike, so how can we expect things to be better in rural India? But we have at least woken up to the possibility of widening the bouquet of direct to home (DTH) educational channels, all of which cover content from pre-school to doctoral studies, and beam them over local cable networks. A “smarter education system” has been upgraded on the policy priority list. The same goes for digital services in healthcare, which have taken off at warp speed. With India lagging seriously behind in developing its physical infrastructure in the health sector; the deep penetration of tele-medicine, consults, advisories and data-interpretation for every primary and secondary health centre would at least lead to early detection and follow-ups in a nation that has a high disease burden. Even on the aspirational index, digitisation on retail and food delivery platforms has revived the traditional mom and pop stores or the neighbourhood restaurant as the lockdown and the subsequent breakdown of the logistic chain led to a confluence of the real with the virtual and made the neighbourhood accessible at the click of a button. Even traditional institutions within the Government sped up processes with computational codes as corporates readily adopted AI-aided services and efficiencies. Contactless living has brought the robot into our daily lives, be it in hospitals, restaurants and homes.

Blaming the victims is never a good strategy. As Britain finally leaves the European Union (EU), we should try to remember that 48 per cent of the turkeys didn’t vote for Christmas. Brexit was not exactly a national act of self-harm. It was really an attack by the nostalgic and nationalist old on the young. This is because 60 per cent of British over-65s voted to leave the EU but 61 per cent of the under-35s voted to remain. Having had four years to think it over, most British people now think it was a mistake — by a 48-39 majority, according to a YouGov poll in October. However, it is too late for all of them. Boris Johnson is Prime Minister and he dare not anger the English ultra-nationalists on the right of his own Conservative party. After months of amateur dramatics that accompany any Johnson decision, on Christmas Day the United Kingdom (UK) concluded a pathetically thin “free trade” deal that reflects the real balance of power between the EU and the UK.

Hindustan Times,2023-08-31 00:00:00,"Adani family secretly invested in own shares, reports Guardian citing offshore records","The Guardian cited new documents the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project has obtained and said they showed the details of an undisclosed and complex offshore operation. The Adani family may have spent years discreetly acquiring stock in the Adani Group’s companies during its meteoric rise to become one of India’s largest and most powerful businesses, the Guardian has reported citing offshore financial records the British daily has seen. The paper referred to newly disclosed documents and said they suggest the family secretly invested hundreds of millions of dollars into the Indian stock market buying its own shares. Adani Group founder Gautam Adani was India’s richest and the world’s third wealthiest person worth over $120bn before New York financial research firm Hindenburg’s report in January accused the conglomerate of pulling off the “largest con in corporate history”. The firm accused the Adani Group of “brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud”. It said opaque offshore companies bought the conglomerate shares and contributed to the “sky high” market valuation hitting a peak of $288bn in 2022. The Adani Group rejected the Hindenburg claims calling them a “calculated attack on India”. It said the firm’s report was an assault on “the independence, integrity, and quality of Indian institutions”.
The Hindenburg report initially wiped $100bn off the conglomerate’s market value. Gautam Adani also lost his spot on the world rich list.The Guardian cited new documents the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) has obtained and said they showed the details of an undisclosed and complex offshore operation in Mauritius for the first time. The documents shared with the Guardian and the Financial Times showed Adani associates seemingly controlled the operation and supported the share prices of its group of companies from 2013 to 2018. The Guardian noted that this offshore network remained impenetrable up until now. It added the records also appear to provide “compelling evidence” of the influential role Adani’s brother, Vinod, allegedly played in the secretive offshore operations. The Adani Group has maintained Vinod Adani has “no role in the day-to-day affairs” of the company. The documents showed two of Vinod Adani’s close associates are named as sole beneficiaries of offshore companies through which the money appeared to flow. The Guardian reported that financial records and interviews also suggest investments into Adani stock from two Mauritius-based funds were overseen by a Dubai-based company, run by a known employee of Vinod Adani. The Guardian cited a letter the OCCRP has uncovered and said the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) handed evidence in early 2014 of Adani Group’s alleged suspicious stock market activity but the government regulator’s interest seemed to lapse after Prime Minister Narendra Modi was voted to power months later. The Guardian noted that the fresh disclosure could have significant political implications for Modi, whose relationship with Gautam Adani goes back 20 years. It added Modi has faced difficult questions about the nature of his partnership with Adani and allegations of preferential treatment of the Adani Group since the Hindenburg report was published. Adani Group’s market value rose from about $8bn in 2013 to $288bn by September 2022. The Adani Group rejected the fresh disclosure calling it nothing but a rehash of unsubstantiated allegations levelled in the Hindenburg report. “Our response to the Hindenburg report is available on our website. Suffice it to state that there is neither any truth to nor any basis for making any of the said allegations against the Adani Group and its promoters and we expressly reject all of them,” the Guardian quoted the group as saying The Guardian said that the trove of documents lays out a complex web of companies dating back to 2010 when Adani family associates Chang Chung-Ling and Nasser Ali Shaban Ahli began setting up offshore shell companies in Mauritius, the British Virgin Islands, and the UAE. It added these financial records appear to show that four of the offshore companies Chang and Ahli, who have both been directors of Adani-linked companies, established sent hundreds of millions of dollars into a large investment fund in Bermuda called Global Opportunities Fund (GOF) with those monies invested in the Indian stock market from 2013 onwards. The investment was made by introducing another layer of opacity. The Guardian said financial records paint a picture of money from the pair’s offshore companies flowing from GOF into two funds to which GOF subscribed: Emerging India Focus Funds (EIFF) and EM Resurgent Fund (EMRF). These funds then appear to have spent years acquiring shares in four Adani-listed companies: Adani Enterprises, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, Adani Power and, later, Adani Transmission.” The Guardian noted the records shine a light on how money in opaque offshore structures can flow secretly into the shares of publicly listed companies in India. The investment decisions of these two funds appeared to be made under the guidance of an investment advisory company controlled by a known employee and associate of Vinod Adani, based in Dubai.” The Guardian said in May 2014, EIFF appears to have held more than $190m of shares in three Adani entities, while EMRF looks to have invested around two-thirds of its portfolio in about $70m of Adani stock. Both funds appear to have used money that came solely from the companies controlled by Chang and Ahli. In September 2014, a separate set of financial records set out how the four Chang and Ahli offshore companies had invested about $260m in Adani shares via this structure. The paper said documents show that this investment appeared to grow over the next three years: by March 2017, the Chang and Ahli offshore companies had invested $430m – 100% of their total portfolio – into Adani company stock. Chang declined to discuss the documents setting out his company’s investments in Adani shares. The Guardian said Chang did not answer questions about his links to Vinod Adani, who along with Ahli did not respond to the paper’s efforts to contact them. The Guardian noted the alleged offshore enterprise of the Adani associates raises questions about the possible breaching of Indian market rules that prevent stock manipulation and regulate public shareholdings of companies. According to the rules, 25% of a company’s shares must be kept “free float”, which means they are available for public trade on the stock exchange, while 75% can be held by promoters, who have declared their direct involvement or connection with the company. The Guardian noted Vinod Adani has recently been acknowledged by the conglomerate as a promoter. But it cited records and said they show that at the peak of their investment, Ahli and Chang held between 8% and 13.5% of the free-floating shares of four Adani companies through EIFF and EMRF. “If their holdings were classified as being controlled by Vinod Adani proxies, the Adani Group’s promoter holdings would have seemingly breached the 75% limit.” The Guardian noted Adani and the Indian government have repeatedly denied that his longstanding connection with Modi has led to preferential treatment. Yet a document unearthed by the OCCRP and seen by the Guardian suggests the SEBI, the government regulator now in charge of investigating the Adani Group, was made aware of stock market activity using Adani offshore funds as far back as early 2014,” it added. “In a letter dated January 2014, Najib Shah, the then head of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), India’s financial law enforcement agency, wrote to Upendra Kumar Sinha, the then head of the SEBI.” Shah said in the letter: “There are indications that [Adani-linked] money may have found its way to stock markets in India as investment and disinvestment in the Adani Group.” He noted that he had sent this material to Sinha because the SEBI was “understood to be investigating into the dealings of the Adani Group of companies in the stock market”. The Guardian noted the SEBI has never publicly disclosed the warning given by the DRI, nor any investigation it might have conducted into the Adani Group in 2014. “The letter appears to misalign with statements made by the SEBI in recent court filings in which it denied there were investigations into the Adani Group before 2020, as well as saying suggestions it had investigated the Adani Group dating back to 2016 were ‘factually baseless’.” The Guardian noted critics, lawyers, and the political opposition have questioned the ability of the SEBI, a regulator under the purview of the Modi government, to independently investigate the Adani Group. The Supreme Court set up an expert committee to investigate the Adani Group after the publication of the Hindenburg report. According to a report given to the court in May, the SEBI had been investigating 13 offshore investors in the conglomerate since 2020 but had “hit a wall” in trying to establish if they were linked to the Adani Group. Two of the entities under investigation are EIFF and EMRF. On Friday last, the SEBI submitted a report to the Supreme Court saying its investigations were in the final stages.","The Guardian newspaper recently reported on newly obtained documents from the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). These documents reveal a previously undisclosed offshore operation linked to the Adani family, one of India's most powerful business groups. The records suggest that the family secretly invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the Indian stock market by purchasing their own company's shares.

Top court cites importance of issue' for the decision; says it received plea seeking the shift; the case, as scheduled earlier, will be listed on Oct. 31

NEW DELHI
n a quick turn of events, Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandra- chud on Monday referred the challenge to the validi- ty of the electoral bonds scheme, which facilitates anonymous donations to political parties, to a Con- stitution Bench of five judges.
During the oral men- tioning hour, the Chief Jus- tice said the court had re- ceived a plea to refer the case from the three-judge Bench to a larger Bench.
He said the case would now go before a five-judge Bench owing to the ""im- portance of the issue"". The case, as scheduled in an
Contentious scheme
The anonymity that electoral bonds allow in political donations has caused concern ever since its introduction in 2018
■ CPI(M), Associa- tion for Democratic Reforms and Common Cause move the Supreme Court claiming the scheme legalises anonymous and unlimited political donations
■The Finance Act, 2017 exempts electoral bonds from disclosure under the Representation of the People Act, 1951
■ Petitioners say 95% of the electoral bonds sold have been in favour of
one political party

By refusing to delay the hearing for the formation of a five-judge Bench, the court has sent a clear mes- sage to the government that it does not intend to delay the hearing any
$
more. The case has been pending in the Supreme Court for over eight years now. ""We are here to de- cide the case,"" Chief Justice Chandrachud observed in the October 10 hearing.","The Supreme Court's recent move under Chief Justice Chandrachu is nothing short of a legal milestone. It involves revisiting a pivotal and long-drawn issue that has remained unresolved for eight years – the intricate matter of anonymous donations to political parties.

This development has elevated the issue's significance, transitioning it from a mere three-judge bench to a five-judge bench, emphasizing the complexity and gravity of the situation. Chief Justice Chandrachu's prompt action makes it unequivocally clear that further delays are unacceptable, sending a resolute message to the government regarding the urgency of resolution.

The initiative to reopen this case has been spearheaded by members of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). They have compellingly argued their case, highlighting the fact that a substantial 95% of anonymous donations, particularly in the form of electoral bonds, seem to favor a single political entity. The confidentiality surrounding these contributions is anchored in the provisions of the Finance Act of 2017, operating under the Representation of the People Act of 1951.

The Supreme Court's audacious move underscores its commitment to the principles of transparency and accountability in the nation's political landscape. This bold step sets the stage for a consequential legal review that could potentially reshape the contours of political financing in India, reflecting a significant stride in the pursuit of enhanced governance and accountability.

Hindustan Times,2017-08-17 00:00:00,Congress seeks SC-monitored probe into Rs 50K-crore power scam linked to Adani Group,"The Congress claimed that the detailed findings of the DRI investigation in 2014 gave “clear and compelling evidence” of over-invoicing of imported equipment by the Adani group, saying it had a direct bearing on the power tariff paid by the common man.The Congress demanded on Friday a Supreme Court-monitored CBI probe into an alleged Rs 50,000-crore scam engineered by a subsidiary of the Adani Enterprises and some shell companies by over-invoicing imported power plant equipment that resulted in inflated electricity tariffs.
The main opposition party also insisted that it will soon file a petition before the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) on the issue. Congress spokesperson Ajay Maken cited a 97-page Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) report, which was first published by The Guardian, to attack Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Maken asked the PM why he was seen being accompanied by Adani Group head Gautam Adani on foreign tours. “On February 5, 2013, the Congress-led UPA government initiated an enquiry into the practice of over invoicing on import of electrical equipment by a subsidiary of the Adani Enterprises Ltd, a leading power company in India,” he told reporters. “But with a change of guard, the BJP-led NDA government decided to go slow on this important matter, and as a result, till today, the investigation has not reached its logical end,” Maken said. The Congress leader claimed that the detailed findings of the DRI investigation in 2014 gave “clear and compelling evidence” of over-invoicing of imported equipment by the Adani group, saying it had a direct bearing on the power tariff paid by the common man. “The findings hold Adani Group and its shell companies responsible for inflating the cost of electricity by up to 860% more than its actual purchase value for a project in Maharashtra using a front company in Dubai,” he alleged. “The Dubai firm allegedly sold back the same equipment to Adani Group-controlled businesses in India at massively inflated prices, in some instances eight times the sale price… The effect of these transactions was that the Adani Group spent an average 400% more for materials. If these allegations are proven, it will demonstrate that Adani utilised off-shore havens to inflate invoices and siphon off funds partly borrowed from state-run bank, thereby inflating the wheeling and generation charges.” Maken further alleged that the three methods through which electricity tariffs had been artificially inflated were over-valuation of imported coal to the tune of Rs 29,000 crore, over-valuation of power plant equipment to the tune of Rs 9,000 crore and compensatory tariffs awarded to the tune of at least Rs 10,000 crore, or possibly higher. The Congress also demanded that there should be an immediate reduction in power costs by up to a factor of Rs 2 per unit wherever these companies were producing and transmitting electricity.","The Congress party has called for a Supreme Court-monitored CBI investigation into an alleged Rs 50,000-crore scam involving a subsidiary of Adani Enterprises and shell companies.

Hindustan Times,2023-09-18 00:00:00,‘Conflict of interest’: Plea in Supreme Court for fresh panel on Adani probe,"Acting on a clutch of petitions demanding a probe into the matter, the Supreme Court on March 2 set up a six-member panel. One of the petitioners in the Adani-Hindenburg case has requested the Supreme Court to reconstitute the panel of experts to investigate into the accusations of regulatory failure and breach of laws against the conglomerate, alleging conflict of interest of three of the six-member panel that is headed by a retired apex court judge. Submitting an application on Monday, Anamika Jaiswal claimed that inclusion of OP Bhatt (former State Bank of India chairman), KV Kamath (veteran banker) and senior advocate Somasekhar Sundaresan in the expert panel is not appropriate, considering their possible conflict of interest in the outcome of the probe into the allegations by US short-seller Hindenburg Research. According to the application, Bhatt is presently working as the chairman of Greenko, a leading renewable energy company, which is working in a close partnership with the Adani group since March 2022 for providing energy to Adani groups facilities in India. “It has also come to the knowledge of the petitioner that Bhatt was examined by the CBI in March 2018 in a case of alleged wrongdoing in disbursing loans to the former liquor baron and fugitive economic offender, Vijay Mallya. Mallya is accused of defrauding banks, including SBI, of US $1.2 billion. It is submitted that Bhatt served as the SBI chairman between 2006 and 2011 when the majority of these loans were advanced to Mallya’s companies,” contended Jaiswal, adding Bhatt should have informed the top court of these relevant facts by himself. Jaiswal is represented by advocate Prashant Bhushan in the matter. About Kamath, Jaiswal said that Kamath, who was the chairman of ICICI Bank from 1996 to 2009, figured in CBI FIR in the ICICI Bank fraud case, in which the bank’s former CEO Chanda Kocchar has been named as a prime accused. “The CBI alleged that she (Kochhar) and her family received various kickbacks over her tenure in lieu of loans provided to the Videocon group, many of which turned into non-performing assets (NPAs). Kamath was the non-executive chairman of the bank when some of those loans were approved and a member of the committee that sanctioned/approved the loans,” the application said. Senior advocate Sundaresan, the plea claimed, has been a lawyer representing the Adani group before various bodies, including the Sebi Board. Jaiswal attached a 2007 order passed by the Sebi Board, showing Sundaresan to have appeared for the Adani group. “In light of above, there is an apprehension that the present expert committee would fail to inspire confidence among the people of the country. It is therefore respectfully prayed, a fresh expert committee may be constituted by this Hon’ble Court with experts from the field of finance, law and stock market with impeccable integrity, and who have no conflict of interest in the outcome of the instant matter,” prayed Jaiswal’s application. The panel, set up by the court through its order on March 2, is headed by former Supreme Court judge AM Sapre, and also comprises justice JP Devdhar (former high court judge) and Nandan Nilekani (Infosys co-founder). Hindenburg’s report published in January claimed, “brazen accounting fraud” and “stock manipulation” by the Gautam Adani-led group. Though the conglomerate rejected the report as “unresearched” and “maliciously mischievous”, it triggered a massive rout of Adani Group stocks, which lost over $140 billion in days and forced the cancellation of a ₹20,000 crore share sale in the group’s flagship. In another application filed on September 11, Jaiswal had alleged that Sebi not only concealed several facts about previous investigations against Adani companies, but also tweaked the regulations to keep the group’s regulatory contraventions and price manipulations undetected. She contended that the market regulator did not apprise the court of an investigation initiated by the directorate of revenue intelligence (DRI) in 2014 against the Adani group companies over alleged overvaluation of import of equipment and machinery by various entities of the group from a UAE-based subsidiary. This application further maintained that Sebi brought amendments into the regulations relating to foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) and listing obligations and disclosure requirement (LODR) were in 2014 and 2015 respectively only to benefit the Adani group. Acting on a clutch of petitions demanding a probe into the matter, the Supreme Court on March 2 set up a six-member panel, led by retired Supreme Court judge AM Sapre, to look into regulatory failure by Sebi and alleged breach of laws by the Adani Group.
In its report submitted in May, the committee said the allegations of stock price manipulation or violation of MPS norms by Adani Group companies cannot be proved “at this stage”.","A petitioner in the Adani-Hindenburg case has urged the Supreme Court to reconsider the composition of a six-member expert panel investigating allegations of regulatory failure and legal breaches by the Adani Group. The petitioner, Anamika Jaiswal, expressed concerns about a potential conflict of interest involving three of the panel members. Jaiswal pointed out that OP Bhatt, the former chairman of the State Bank of India and a member of the panel, has ties to Adani Group's partner Greenko, which may affect the probe's outcome. She also raised concerns about KV Kamath, the former chairman of ICICI Bank, who was named in a CBI FIR related to an ICICI Bank fraud case. Another panel member, senior advocate Somasekhar Sundaresan, has represented the Adani Group in legal matters before the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).",Business and Finance

During the 91st edition of the address, the Prime Minister urged people to hoist the national flag in each home as part of the “Har Ghar Tiranga” initiative under which the government aims to cover over 200 million households between August 13 and 15. He also urged people to put the “tiranga” (India’s national flag) as the profile picture of their social media accounts between August 2 and 15. “Let us further this movement by hoisting the National Flag at our homes,” he said.
Noting that August 2 is the birth anniversary of Pinagali Venkaiah, who designed the national flag, the Prime Minister suggested that people use an image of the Tricolour as their profile pictures. “The Tricolour connects us, inspires us to do something for the country. I also have a suggestion that from August 2 to 15, all of us can place the Tricolour in our social media profile pictures... I pay my respectful homage to him (Pinagali Venkaiah),” Modi said. “Talking about our national flag, I will also remember the great revolutionary Madam Cama. Her role in shaping the Tricolour has been very important.”
The Prime Minister said he was happy that the Mahotsav was taking the form of a mass movement, with people from all walks of life and from every section of society participating in different programmes across the country. “When India completes 75 years of its Independence, all of us are going to witness a splendid and historic moment,” he said. It is the good fortune of the current generation to witness the 75th anniversary of Independence Day, he said. “Had we been born in the era of slavery, how would have we imagined this day,” he said, asserting that the biggest message that emerges from all events being organised in the ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’ is that countrymen should follow their duty with full devotion. “Only then will we be able to fulfil the dreams of those countless freedom fighters and to build the India of their dreams,” he said. That is why this ‘Amrit Kaal’ of our next 25 years is “Kartavyakaal”, a period of duty for every citizen. The Prime Minister, on March 12 last year, initiated a 75-week countdown to the 75th anniversary of Independence from Sabarmati Ashram in Ahemdabad. As part of the campaign, the government launched several programmes, including the “Har Ghar Tiranga” campaign. Under the campaign, the railways observed a week of ‘Azadi ki Rail Gadi’, between July 18 and 23, through 27 trains and 75 railway stations, across 24 states that are linked to the Indian freedom struggle. At these 75 stations, apart from the usual decorations of lights and other ornamentations, events such as street plays in local language, light-and-sound shows, display of patriotic films and songs were also played. The PM urged the people to visit such stations to gather knowledge about their significance in the freedom struggle. “These 75 stations are being decorated very ornately. Many types of programmes are also being organized at these stations. You should take time out to visit one such historical station in your vicinity. I urge the students of school, and the teachers to take the small children of their school to the nearby station and narrate the whole chain of events to those children,” said Modi. Modi also referred to the Gomoh Junction in Jharkhand which is now officially known as Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Junction Gomoh and explained the reason for its renaming. “Netaji Subhas was successful in dodging British officers by boarding the Kalka Mail. All of you must have heard the name of Kakori Railway Station near Lucknow..,” he said.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi talked about the Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav, a government initiative to celebrate the 75th anniversary of India's independence.

Hindustan Times,2022-10-08 00:00:00,"Raut taken to ED office, he says evidence is false","The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Sunday conducted a search at Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut’s house and later took him to the central agency’s office in south Mumbai for questioning in a money laundering probe, even as the Sena leader from the Uddhav Thackeray camp said he was being framed on the basis of false evidence. Raut was questioned at his Bhandup residence for at least eight hours over alleged irregularities in the re-development of Mumbai’s Patra Chawl and related transactions involving his wife and others. ED searched Raut’s house and seized ₹11.50 lakh unaccounted cash, an official of the agency said, asking not to be named. Sunday’s action came after the Sena leader skipped summons twice for questioning in the money-laundering case. He was summoned by the agency on July 27 after he skipped an earlier summons, citing the ongoing Parliament session in the national capital. The Sena’s Rajya Sabha MP said he was being framed based on “false evidence” but that he won’t bow down and quit the party, shortly before being taken to the Mumbai office of ED. “They (ED) are going to arrest me. I am going to be arrested,” he told reporters outside the ED office. “False action, false evidence. I will die, but will not surrender. I will never leave Shiv Sena. I swear by Balasaheb Thackeray that I am not involved in any scam. He taught us to fight and I will continue to fight for Shiv Sena,” the Sena leader tweeted earlier. He said the ED action was aimed at weakening the Shiv Sena and Maharashtra. Officials of ED, accompanied by Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel, reached Raut’s house at 7am on Sunday to begin their search. Hundreds of Shiv Sena supporters gathered outside Raut’s residence soon after the ED action began and shouted slogans. About 200 police personnel were deployed around Raut’s residence on Sunday. “The agency asked us to bring certain documents so we require some time to collect the documents; we requested the agency to give at least two weeks’ time,” Raut’s lawyer had said on July 27. ED’s case is based on a first information report (FIR) registered by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Mumbai Police in 2018 against Rakesh and Sarang Wadhawan, promoters of the real estate company Housing Development and Infrastructure Ltd (HDIL), Guru Ashish Construction Pvt Ltd, a subsidiary of HDIL that undertook the redevelopment of Patra Chawl in Goregaon and its director Pravin Raut among others. The agency said that its probe has so far found that around ₹100 crore was transferred from HDIL to the account of Pravin Raut, who was arrested in the case on February 2. This amount was further “diverted” by Pravin Raut, a close associate of the Sena MP, to various accounts of his associates, family members and business entities etc, the federal agency said. “In 2010, part of the proceeds of crime, ₹83 lakh, was received by Varsha Raut, wife of Sanjay Raut, directly/indirectly from Madhuri Raut, wife of Pravin Raut,” ED said in a statement earlier. “This amount was utilised by Varsha Raut for purchase of flat at Dadar East,” it said. As part of its probe, in April, ED attached properties worth ₹11.15 crore belonging to Varsha Raut, including the flat in Dadar and plots in Kihim, an official said. Before going with ED officials to the agency’s office on Sunday, Raut came down at the gate of his home, waved at his supporters and displayed a saffron scarf. While on his way to the ED office in a vehicle, Raut stood up and once again waved at his supporters. His younger brother Sunil Raut, an MLA, was seen arguing with police over the ED action. Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray alleged that the agency’s action against Raut was part of a “conspiracy” to finish off the party. “He may get arrested. What conspiracy is this? Shiv Sena gives strength to Hindus and Marathi people and hence there is a conspiracy to finish off the party,” he said. Maharashtra chief minister Eknath Shinde said if Raut was innocent, he should not be afraid of ED action against him. “Raut has declared that he has not done anything wrong. If that is so, why fear a probe? Let it happen. Why fear if you are innocent?” he told reporters in Aurangabad. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders in Maharashtra also said that Raut should not be afraid of the ED action if he has not done anything wrong.
Leader of Opposition in the Maharashtra assembly, Ajit Pawar, said he wondered why ED repeatedly wants to investigate Raut, though many people had been served notices by the Income Tax department, CBI, and ED. Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said the ED action depicts a “sorry picture” of democracy and alleged that the BJP wants to “silence” all opposition parties.","The Enforcement Directorate (ED) conducted a search at Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut’s house in connection with a money laundering probe. Raut was questioned for eight hours over alleged irregularities in the redevelopment of Mumbai’s Patra Chawl. The ED seized ₹11.50 lakh in unaccounted cash during the search. Raut had skipped ED summons earlier, citing Parliament sessions. He claimed to be framed based on ""false evidence"" but refused to quit the party. Shiv Sena supporters gathered outside his residence, and police were deployed. Raut's lawyer had requested more time to gather documents. Opposition parties expressed concern over the ED's actions.",Crime and Justice
Hindustan Times,2022-08-01 00:00:00,"Mirabai Chanu, a champion winning medals, global fans","It’s close to 9pm in Birmingham, more than two hours after Mirabai Chanu has won the Commonwealth Games gold. After putting in every ounce of her power into four successful lifts adding up to 394kg and two unsuccessful ones of 205kg, you would probably excuse her for trying to find an escape from the exhaustive world of fan selfies and autograph requests.But here was Mirabai crouching to pose with a young Indian-origin girl, steering herself behind a banner for a local volunteer’s request of a funky picture setting, bringing a smile as fresh as from the podium for the umpteen demands for a click till each one of them had been met. She even performed a split with an English kid interested in gymnastics who had come to watch the Indian do her thing in weightlifting. In the modern hashtag sporting world of Instagram lives and YouTube videos, finding a people’s champion can be rare; a fan favourite who takes out time for that particular fan in person and not just on TV screens. Mirabai is one, even more so globally after her Tokyo Olympics feat. Fans see an achiever in Mirabai, Mirabai sees a friend in fans. “When fans come to me and recognize me, it’s very important for me. I also feel proud, makes me feel that I have achieved something in life if they are able to recognise me,” Mirabai says. “They give me so much love. They treat me like their friend. For me, friends are very important in life, people who love me for who I am and support me.” Surely, though, after an afternoon of high-quality weightlifting, evening of post-victory rituals and recovery sessions, you could turn your back on them at some point to call it a night? “Mein unko na nahi bol sakti (I can’t say no to them). They talk to me with so much love, I can never say no. For me, audience is very important. It’s because of them that this medal means so much. They have a different look on their face when they see me. Acha lagta hai (I like it). I feel happy that people come to meet me,” she says. Her Tokyo silver has meant those people aren’t just restricted to the 27-year-old’s home country. They are spread across far and wide — from Tashkent to Singapore to Birmingham. A couple of young Englishmen walk up to Mirabai and complement her on her snatch efforts on Saturday. “Thank you so much,” Mirabai replies repeatedly. They then hesitantly ask if she would be okay clicking a picture with them. Mirabai willingly obliges.Mirabai can herself feel the shift in popularity, not just mathematically but geographically too. “Yes, that has changed for me after Tokyo. There are so many fans who follow me, so many who recognize me, so many who support me, so many who motivate me from all over the world. I feel very good about it, for now,” Mirabai chuckles. Mirabai’s deep connect with the fans also made her tear up at the podium while India’s national anthem was being sung by the Indian spectators at the NEC Hall. “It was the best feeling for me. It’s the first time I saw something like this and felt this kind of support from the audience, all of us singing the national anthem together,” she says. In all the fan-fulfilling that followed, Mirabai says she hasn’t yet spoken to her mother post the final. “Kaha time mila hai (where have I found the time),” she says. For the Mirabai Chanu fan, though, there’s plenty.","Mirabai Chanu, the Commonwealth Games gold medalist, remains devoted to her fans, even after her victory. She graciously poses for photos and takes the time to connect with supporters, especially young admirers. Mirabai sees her fans as friends and appreciates their love and support. Her popularity has grown worldwide, thanks to her Tokyo Olympics silver medal, with fans from various countries expressing their admiration. Mirabai was deeply moved when the Indian spectators sang the national anthem at the podium. Despite her busy schedule, she hasn't had the chance to speak to her mother yet, but for her fans, there's always time.",International News
Hindustan Times,2022-08-01 00:00:00,Oppn hits out at govt in House on price rise,"The Congress on Monday held the Bharatiya Janata Party-led central government responsible for the price rise, saying its decisions have hit hard 25 crore households in the country and widened the divide between the rich and the poor. Initiating a debate on the issue of the price rise in Lok Sabha, Congress member Manish Tewari alleged that savings, investment, production, consumption and employment, the five pillars of the economy, have been blown away due to the wrong policies of the Union government. “During the UPA regime, 27 crore people were brought above the poverty line. Then it was learnt from a report, which was made public in 2021, that as many as 23 crore people are once again below the poverty line, “ he said. The issue will be taken up in the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday.
On Monday, both the Houses of the Parliament witnessed two repeated adjournments over ruckus created by Opposition leaders during the debate on price rise and various issues, including the arrest of Shiv Sena lawmaker Sanjay Raut by the Enforcement Directorate in a money laundering case, drawing criticism by the ruling party members over conduct in the Parliament the during the monsoon session.The Lower House was adjourned after the Opposition demanded the suspension of four Congress lawmakers be revoked. In Rajya Sabha, the Opposition continued sloganeering and Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge demanded a discussion over price rise. To this, Bhubaneswar Kalita, presiding in the Chair, responded that the matter would be taken up Tuesday.In the Lok Sabha, Tewari said the number of billionaires in India increased from 100 to 142 in these years, the income of those in the lower strata has been decreasing day by day, he said. He said it is “unfortunate” that 77% of the country’s wealth is in the hands of one percent of the population and the wealth of the 92 most rich persons in India put together is equal to that of 55 crore Indians. “There can’t be bigger inequality than this in our country,” he saidThe situations arising out of the Covid-19 pandemic would be a factor leading to the current economic scenario but the country’s economy had already started weakening with the government’s decision to demonetise high-value currency notes on November 8, 2016, he charged. After the note ban, the government brought in GST implementation which hit at least 2.30 lakh small industries. “This note ban and GST not just impacted medium and small scale industries but employment also,” he said. To join the league of the developed countries, about two third of a country’s eligible population should have employment. “But, in India, just about 40 crore people have jobs today,” Tewari said. To become a developed country, the number of people employed in the country has to increase to 84 crore. “But this government, unfortunately, doesn’t have any strategy for this,” he charged. Slamming the government over the GST hike, Tewari said, ”You have increased the GST on flour, curd, paneer, pencil and sharpener. You did not spare even children.” The Congress leader said he was “hurt” when 18 per cent GST was imposed on “crematoriums”. Hitting out at the government over the rise in fuel prices, Tewari said the Centre collected ₹27 lakh crore through “tax, excise duty and dividend” in the petroleum sector to swell its coffers but did not pass on the benefits to the people. “The government may have streamlined its own budget, but has completely spoiled the life of country’s 25 crore households…. every homemaker is in tears,” he said, and asked the government, “What kind of nation are you building?” Opposition parties had stalled Parliament proceedings for days demanding a debate on price rise. However, amid the ruckus created by the Opposition on the issue, Union ministers Piyush Goyal and Pralhad Joshi expressed their concerns over Parliament not being allowed to function normally.
Addressing the media persons, Goyal said, “The central government was ready from the first day to discuss about inflation. However, the Opposition wasn’t allowing the House (Lok Sabha) to function normally. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had Covid-19. Knowing that she has just recovered, we are appealing to them for the House to function normally.” Goyal said that the Opposition is not letting the House run and is running away from discussing other issues. However, the opposition Trinamool Congress said the onus of ensuring smooth functioning of Parliament also lies on the ruling dispensation, adding that the party will continue to protest and raise public issues. “The onus of ensuring the smooth functioning of the house depends on the incumbent as well! We’ll continue our protest till Shri @narendramodi led Central Govt. becomes humble enough to register the grievances of the public at large,” the TMC tweeted. “Your suspensions & threats won’t silence us,” it added. “We have many bills to pass but unfortunately, the House is getting adjourned. If the Leader of Congress Parliamentary Party gives assurance in the house that MPs will not come with placards, then, we are ready to withdraw the suspension,” said Joshi.","The Congress party, in a debate in the Lok Sabha, blamed the BJP-led government for rising prices, alleging it adversely affects 25 crore households in India and exacerbates income inequality. They cited an increase in the number of billionaires and growing wealth disparity in the country. The government's decisions, including demonetization and the implementation of the GST, were criticized for negatively impacting the economy and employment. The opposition disrupted parliamentary proceedings, leading to repeated adjournments. Union ministers expressed their willingness to discuss inflation but accused the opposition of hindering the functioning of the house. The Trinamool Congress emphasized the government's responsibility for ensuring parliamentary order.",Politics

Hindustan Times,2022-08-02 00:00:00,Sena MP Raut in ED custody till August 4,"Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut, who was arrested late on Sunday by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with a money laundering probe, was on Monday remanded in the custody of the federal agency for three days. MG Deshpande, the special Mumbai judge designated to hear cases registered under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), rejected ED’s request to give them his custody for eight days, observing that such a long custodial interrogation wasn’t necessary to probe the money trail linked to his wife Varsha, which the court said, can be probed through bank statements. Deshpande remanded Sanjay Raut in ED custody till August 4. Sanjay Raut was arrested after being grilled for over eight hours at his Bhandup residence in connection with the money laundering case registered regarding the Patra Chawl re-development project. ED also seized ₹11.50 lakh from the house during a search. As Sanjay Raut was being taken to the special judge, Sanjay Raut said: “This is an attempt to finish us”. In its request for the Shiv Sena leader’s custody, Enforcement Directorate’s lawyer Hiten Venegaonkar said Sanjay Raut and his family members were direct beneficiaries of ₹1.06 crore of the ₹112 crore earned by Pravin Raut, a real estate developer and ex-director of Guruashish Construction, who was arrested on February 2.
“Pravin Raut was the front-man of Sanjay Raut,” Venegaonkar said, adding that the agency has traced the ₹1.06 crore received from Pravin Raut and asserted that the 10 land parcels were bought by Sanjay Raut’s wife Varsha at Kihim near Alibag in the name of their spouses and 60 to 70% of the price paid in cash. Venegaonkar also alleged that Raut received a monthly payment of ₹2 lakh from Pravin Raut, who also sponsored several foreign trips of the Sena leader and his family. Enforcement Directorate lawyer added that Sanjay Raut tried to tamper with evidence and threatened key witnesses, but did not get into the specifics. Senior advocate Ashok Mundargi, who represented the Rajya Sabha member, rebutted the Enforcement Directorate allegations, claiming that Sanjay Raut was arrested due to political vendetta and that the allegations against the Shiv Sena leader were speculative in nature.
Mundargi also cited the MP’s key role in the recent crisis faced by the Shiv Sena to explain Enforcement Directorate charge that he hadn’t cooperated with the probe. Enforcement Directorate’s case is based on a first information report (FIR) registered by the Economic Offences Wing of the Mumbai Police in 2018 against Rakesh and Sarang Wadhawan, promoters of the real estate company Housing Development and Infrastructure Ltd (HDIL), Guruashish Construction Pvt Ltd, a subsidiary of HDIL that undertook the redevelopment of Patra Chawl in Goregaon and its director Pravin Raut among others. The agency said that its probe has so far found that around ₹100 crore was transferred from HDIL to the account of Pravin Raut, who was arrested in the case on February 2. This amount was further “diverted” by Pravin Raut, a close associate of the Sena MP, to various accounts of his associates, family members and business entities etc, the federal agency said. “In 2010, part of the proceeds of crime, ₹83 lakh, was received by Varsha Raut, wife of Sanjay Raut, directly/indirectly from Madhuri Raut, wife of Pravin Raut,” Enforcement Directorate said in a statement earlier. “This amount was utilised by Varsha Raut for purchase of flat at Dadar East,” it said. As part of its probe, in April, Enforcement Directorate attached properties worth ₹11.15 crore belonging to Varsha Raut, including the flat in Dadar and plots in Kihim, an official said.","Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut, arrested in a money laundering probe, was granted three days of custody by a Mumbai judge. The judge rejected the request for an eight-day custody, deeming it unnecessary for investigating the money trail related to his wife Varsha, suggesting that bank statements could suffice. Sanjay Raut was arrested after an eight-hour interrogation at his residence. The Enforcement Directorate alleged that he and his family benefited from funds linked to a real estate developer and sponsor, Pravin Raut, which Sanjay Raut's lawyer refuted as politically motivated and speculative. The case is based on an FIR from 2018 against HDIL promoters and others.",Crime and Justice

Hindustan Times,2022-08-04 00:00:00,Will not abandon Taiwan: US amid Beijing’s threats,"United States’ House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, meeting leaders in Taiwan despite warnings from China, said on Wednesday that she and other members of Congress in a visiting delegation are showing they will not abandon their commitment to the self-governing island. “Today the world faces a choice between democracy and autocracy,” she said in a short speech during a meeting with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen. “America’s determination to preserve democracy, here in Taiwan and around the world, remains ironclad.” China, which claims Taiwan as its territory and opposes any engagement by Taiwanese officials with foreign governments, announced multiple military exercises around the island, parts of which will enter Taiwanese waters, and issued a series of harsh statements after the delegation touched down Tuesday night in the Taiwanese capital, Taipei. Taiwan decried the planned actions. “Such an act equals to sealing off Taiwan by air and sea, such an act covers our country’s territory and territorial waters, and severely violates our country’s territorial sovereignty,” Capt. Jian-chang Yu said at a briefing by National Defense Ministry. The Chinese military exercises, including live fire, are to start Thursday and be the largest aimed at Taiwan since 1995, when China fired missiles in a large-scale exercise to show its displeasure at a visit by then-Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui to the US. China’s official Xinhua News Agency announced the military actions Tuesday night, along with a map outlining six different areas around Taiwan. Pelosi’s trip has heightened US-China tensions more than visits by other members of Congress because of her high-level position as leader of the House of Representatives. She is the first speaker of the House to visit Taiwan in 25 years, since Newt Gingrich in 1997. Taiwanese President Tsai responded Wednesday to Beijing’s military intimidation. “Facing deliberately heightened military threats, Taiwan will not back down,” Tsai said at her meeting with Pelosi. “We will firmly uphold our nation’s sovereignty and continue to hold the line of defense for democracy.” Tsai, thanking Pelosi for her decades of support for Taiwan, presented the speaker with a civilian honour, the Order of the Propitious Clouds. China’s response has been loud and varied. Shortly after Pelosi landed Tuesday night, China announced live-fire drills that reportedly started that night, as well as the four-day exercises starting Thursday. Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng also summoned the US ambassador in Beijing, Nicholas Burns, to convey the country’s protests the same night. Pelosi addressed Beijing’s threats Wednesday morning, saying she hopes it’s clear that while China has prevented Taiwan from attending certain international meetings, “that they understand they will not stand in the way of people coming to Taiwan as a show of friendship and of support.” Pelosi noted that support for Taiwan is bipartisan in Congress and praised the island’s democracy. She stopped short of saying that the U.S would defend Taiwan militarily, emphasizing that Congress is “committed to the security of Taiwan, in order to have Taiwan be able to most effectively defend themselves.” Her focus has always been the same, she said, going back to her 1991 visit to Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, when she and other lawmakers unfurled a small banner supporting democracy two years after a bloody military crackdown on protesters at the square. That visit was also about human rights and what she called dangerous technology transfers to “rogue countries.”The administration of US President Joe Biden has sought to tone down the volume on the visit, insisting there’s no change in US’ longstanding “one-China policy,” which recognizes Beijing but allows informal relations and defence ties with Taipei.","United States House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, emphasizing America's commitment to the self-governing island, despite objections from China.

Hindustan Times,2022-08-04 00:00:00,"COURT CAN’T DECIDE ON ISSUE OF DISSENT, SAYS SHINDE CAMP","Intraparty dissent against the leadership is not an issue to be decided through a judicial order, the Eknath Shinde camp on Wednesday told the Supreme Court while maintaining that the petitions filed by the Shiv Sena’s Uddhav Thackeray faction are not sustainable in law since they involve a political thicket. According to the Shinde camp, issues raised by the Uddhav faction regarding the disqualification of MLAs or the recognition of the real Shiv Sena are political issues that must be left by the court to be determined by a duly elected assembly Speaker and the Election Commission of India (ECI). As a bench led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana adjourned for Thursday a clutch of petitions filed by both the Shinde and Uddhav factions for finalising the legal issues involved in the matter, the Shinde camp asserted that the to court should refrain from examining the issues of disqualification or recognition of the real Sena at the first instance when the Speaker and ECI are yet to adjudicate. The Uddhav faction, on the other hand, emphasised that every act of Maharashtra chief minister Eknath Shinde and his MLAs reeks of anti-party activities, and therefore they are disentitled from getting any propitious orders from the Speaker or ECI on account of being defectors. By merely having a two-thirds majority among the MLAs, the faction backing former CM Uddhav Thackeray argued, Shinde’s group cannot become the real Shiv Sena because they have already given up membership of the party by implicating themselves in anti-party activities. The bench, which also included justices Krishna Murari and Hima Kohli, was Wednesday hearing a batch of six petitions filed by Shinde and Uddhav factions in relation to disqualification proceedings against the MLAs of both camps, election of Rahul Narwekar as new Speaker of the assembly, recognition of a new party whip for Shiv Sena, and the governor’s directive to Uddhav for proving majority on the floor of the house and subsequently inviting Shinde to form the new government in the state. Narwekar is currently restrained by the top court from deciding the disqualification petitions pending against the MLAs of Shiv Sena belonging to both the Shinde and Uddhav factions. The coup, led by the rebel MLAs, forced Uddhav to resign as CM on June 29, leading to a dramatic takeover of Shinde as Maharashtra CM on the very next day. Later, the Shinde faction also proved majority on the floor of the House with the support of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), whose leader Devendra Fadnavis took oath as deputy chief minister on June 30. Senior advocates Harish Salve, Neeraj K Kaul and Mahesh Jethmalani, appearing for the Shinde faction, highlighted that Shinde or his MLAs have not left the Shiv Sena, and therefore the issue of incurring disqualification because of voluntarily giving up party’s membership does not arise at all. “We are not saying we have left the party or they have left the party. But that does not mean an intra-party dissent cannot be allowed and someone who does not have the support of his party members will cling on to the chair by swinging the sword of disqualification. “Any order by a court will not be anti-defection but anti-democracy in a political party. This will be stifling dissent in a political party,” Salve argued.
Asked by the bench as to why the Shinde camp has gone to ECI for being recognised as the real Shiv Sena if both factions constitute the same party, Salve said that the move is aimed at dispelling confusion among the voters in view of the upcoming municipal polls in Mumbai. “This is mixing politics with legalities. The CM (Uddhav) resigned and there is a new dispensation now. BMC elections are round the corner and there should not be any confusion among the voters. “That is why we are before the Election Commission. I am saying that there are two groups within the political party and the question is now of the leadership. “This is not happening for the first time. It happened in Congress in 1969,” he maintained. Salve added that the first question before the court should be whether there are any justiciable issues for it to decide and whether it would assume the role of a tribunal to adjudge disqualification pleas against MLAs after stripping a duly elected Speaker off his constitutional role. At this, the bench reminded Salve that it was his client who first approached the court in June. “But that was because the deputy speaker was proceeding even though there was a removal motion against him. And his actions were in the teeth of a Supreme Court judgment,” replied Salve, adding the subsequent petitions by the Uddhav faction were not maintainable in law. Representing the Uddhav camp, senior advocates Kapil Sibal, Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Devadatt Kamat maintained that the Udhav faction is the real Sena. “What is being done today is to use the Tenth Schedule (anti-defection law) to encourage defection. If this is permitted, the majority can be used to topple any government. Is that the purpose of the Tenth Schedule? To instigate and legitimize defections?” asked Sibal. He added that since Shinde and his MLAs are defectors, all the subsequent proceedings, including election of Speaker, appointment of the new CM, calling of the House and the floor test, are illegal. “So, if all these are illegal, the decisions of the Maharashtra government are illegal, void ab initio, affecting the destiny of the people. That is the urgency of the matter,” pressed Sibal. By delaying the proceedings before the court, Singhvi said, the “gameplan” of the Shinde faction is to attain legitimacy as the real Shiv Sena from ECI. The bench then asked Salve to redraft his submissions to enable the court zero in on the legal issues involved in the matter.","In a legal battle over intraparty dissent within the Shiv Sena, the Eknath Shinde camp argued before the Supreme Court that issues related to the disqualification of MLAs and recognition of the real Shiv Sena are political matters that should be determined by the assembly Speaker and the Election Commission of India (ECI), not through a judicial order. They emphasized that judicial intervention in such matters would stifle political dissent. On the other hand, the Uddhav faction contended that Shinde and his MLAs had engaged in anti-party activities, making them defectors and disentitled to favorable orders from the Speaker or ECI. The case involves multiple petitions filed by both factions related to disqualification proceedings, the election of a new Speaker, recognition of a new party whip, and the change in government leadership in Maharashtra. The Shinde camp argued that they haven't left the Shiv Sena and that their actions do not warrant disqualification, while the Uddhav faction asserted that Shinde's group cannot be considered the real Shiv Sena due to their defection. The court has urged the parties to focus on the legal issues involved in the case.",Politics

Hindustan Times,2022-08-05 00:00:00,China fires missiles in live drills near Taiwan,"Beijing : Tension around the self-ruled Taiwan soared to unprecedented levels on Thursday after the Chinese military fired ballistic missiles on the waters around it amid intense live-fire exercises as the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) encircled the island from six directions, blocking it from the sea as well as air, a day after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi concluded her visit to the island. The Chinese military did not share details but reports from Taiwan said among the missiles fired were PLA’s nuclear-capable Dongfeng. PLA’s drills, ongoing from Tuesday night, intensified Thursday noon as Beijing continues to fume over US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taipei earlier this week. China claims the democratically-ruled Taiwan as its own territory and has not ruled out the use of force to merge it with the mainland. A Chinese media report said the ongoing drills, the largest ever around the Taiwan Strait, is part of a “rehearsal” for the reunification process. Reports from Taiwan said its armed forces had gone on full alert and had upgraded their combat readiness. Taiwan’s defence ministry said 11 Chinese Dongfeng ballistic missiles had been fired in waters around the island. The last time that happened was in 1996. Taiwan officials said the drills violated United Nations rules, invaded its space and threatened free air and sea navigation. It has been self-ruled since 1949, when Mao Zedong’s communists took power in Beijing after defeating Chiang Kai-shek’s Kuomintang (KMT) nationalists in a civil war, prompting the KMT-led government to retreat to the island. Pelosi’s unannounced visit defied warnings from China. Before Thursday’s drills officially began, Chinese navy ships and military aircraft briefly crossed the Taiwan Strait median line several times in the morning, a Taiwanese source briefed on the matter told Reuters. The Taiwanese military closely monitored the path of the Dongfeng missiles soon after they were fired by the PLA’s eastern command’s rocket division. China’s state broadcaster CCTV announced the start of the drills on Thursday, adding that the exercises would end at 0400 GMT on Sunday. The exercise, led by the navy and air force, would include live firing on the waters and in the airspace surrounding Taiwan, the CCTV report said. “The exercises involved troops from the Navy, Air Force, Rocket Force, Strategic Support Force and Logistic Support Force under the Eastern Theatre Command,” official news agency, Xinhua, said in a report on Thursday. “Video clips taken by netizens soon circulated on social media showing that long-range rockets were fired from Pingtan, eastern China’s Fujian province, only 125 kilometers away from the island of Taiwan,” the state-run tabloid, Global Times reported. This means that the missiles, likely fired from the Chinese mainland, have flown over the sky above Taiwan, anonymous observers told the tabloid. Neither the military nor Chinese state media have so far revealed how many warships and fighter jets have been used or the strength of the artillery or ground forces deployed. The PLA announced that “relevant sea and airspace control off the eastern coast of Taiwan island” were lifted after the missile drill. In Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said China will no longer arrange a meeting between Chinese and Japanese foreign ministers on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) events in Cambodia. The Chinese side is strongly displeased with the joint statement put out by G7 nations - including Japan - about Taiwan, Hua said at the regular ministry briefing on Thursday, adding that Tokyo has no right to make irresponsible remarks on Taiwan. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi called Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan a “manic, irresponsible and highly irrational” act, state broadcaster CCTV reported. Wang, speaking at a meeting of Southeast Asian foreign ministers in Cambodia, said China had made the utmost diplomatic effort to avert crisis but would never let its core interests be hurt.","Tension escalated between China and Taiwan as the Chinese military fired ballistic missiles and encircled the island from multiple directions following US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. China, which claims Taiwan as its territory, launched its largest-ever military exercises in the Taiwan Strait. The exercises included the firing of 11 ballistic missiles and were seen as part of a reunification ""rehearsal."" Taiwan criticized the drills for violating international rules and endangering free navigation. China expressed strong disapproval of Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, and its foreign minister labeled it ""manic, irresponsible, and highly irrational.""",International News

The development comes at a time when new doors have been opened for women in the defence services. The five women officers are based at the Naval Air Enclave in Porbandar. The women officers underwent months of ground training and comprehensive mission briefings in the run-up to the “historical sortie,” the navy said in a statement. “The Indian Navy has been a front-runner in driving transformation in the armed forces. Its pioneering women empowerment initiatives include induction of women pilots, selection of women air operations officers into the helicopter stream and conducting an all-women sailing circumnavigation expedition across the globe in 2018,” it stated. The navy will also be the first among the three services to induct women into the personnel below officer rank (PBOR) cadre under the new Agnipath model. “This first-of-its-kind military flying mission was, however, unique and is expected to pave the way for women officers in the aviation cadre to assume greater responsibility and aspire for more challenging roles,” the navy said, adding that the mission showcased ‘Nari Shakti’ in its real spirit. “It perhaps marks a unique achievement for the armed forces that a crew of only women officers undertook an independent operational mission in a multi-crew maritime surveillance aircraft.”","An all-women navy aircrew made history by conducting a maritime reconnaissance mission in the north Arabian Sea.

PRESIDENT RAJAPAKSA INFORMED THE SPEAKER ABOUT THIS DECISION TO QUIT
AFTER ABEYWARDENA WROTE TO HIM SEEKING HIS RESIGNATION FOLLOWING THE
ALL-PARTY MEETING OF LEADERS HELD SATURDAY EVENING.
 gotabaya-rajapaksa-g AgenciesFile Photo: Rajapaksa appears to have
gone underground in the face of massive public anger over an
unprecedented economic crisis since the country became independent in
1948.
Colombo: Sri Lanka's embattled President Gotabaya Rajapaksa would
resign on Wednesday, Parliament Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena
announced late Saturday night, hours after thousands of protesters
stormed his official residence, blaming his government for an
unprecedented economic crisis that has brought the country to its
knees.
President Rajapaksa informed the Speaker about this decision to quit
after Abeywardena wrote to him seeking his resignation following the
all-party meeting of leaders held Saturday evening.
The party leaders had demanded the immediate resignation of President
Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to make way for
Abeywardena to become acting president until Parliament appointed a
successor.
Wickremesinghe, 73, has already expressed his willingness to resign.
But an angry mob did not spare his private home here and set it on
fire.
Rajapaksa, 73, responded to the Speaker's letter, saying he would quit
on July 13. Rajapaksa became Sri Lankan President in November 2020.
Earlier, Speaker Abeywardena had asked President Rajapaksa and Prime
Minister Wickremesinghe to resign immediately to make way for an
all-party government after the country witnessed its biggest protest
yet amid an unprecedented economic crisis.
Abeywardena in his letter to Rajapaksa, whose whereabouts are still
not known, informed him about the outcome of the party leaders'
meeting he had convened this evening after which Wickremesinghe
offered to resign and form an all-party government.
He told Rajapaksa that party leaders wanted him and Wickremesinghe to
resign immediately, Parliament to be convened in seven days to appoint
an acting president, and appoint an interim all-party government under
a new Prime Minister commanding majority in Parliament. It was also
decided to call for elections within a short period of time and
install a new government.
Rajapaksa appears to have gone underground in the face of massive
public anger over an unprecedented economic crisis since the country
became independent in 1948.
Earlier in the day, thousands of protesters stormed the official
residence of President Rajapaksa. It is believed that President
Rajapaksa left the house before the massive crowd arrived.
In May, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's elder brother and Prime
Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa had to quit in the face of massive
anti-government protests.
The Rajapaksa brothers, Mahinda and Gotabaya, were hailed by many in
Sri Lanka as heroes for winning the civil war against the LTTE but
they are now blamed for the country's worst economic crisis.
The expected exit of President Rajapaksa on Wednesday and the
resignation of Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister in May is a
dramatic fall from grace for a powerful family that has dominated Sri
Lankan politics for more than a decade.
Sri Lanka, a country of 22 million people, is under the grip of an
unprecedented economic turmoil, the worst in seven decades, crippled
by an acute shortage of foreign exchange that has left it struggling
to pay for essential imports of fuel, and other essentials.
The country, with an acute foreign currency crisis that resulted in
foreign debt default, had announced in April that it is suspending
nearly USD 7 billion foreign debt repayment due for this year out of
about USD 25 billion due through 2026.

PERSECUTION OF UYGHURS.
 uighars agencies AgenciesRepresentative Image
NEW DELHI: The Campaign for Uyghurs, which works for the persecuted
Uyghurs in China, has demanded that the United Nations should formally
recognise treatment of the community by Beijing as genocide.
The Campaign for Uyghurs has released a report titled ‘Genocide in
East Turkistan’ in which it has highlighted how the Chinese
government has persecuted Uyghurs.
The report said that despite the Covid-19 pandemic, the Chinese
government continues its oppression and persecution of Uyghurs.
“The Chinese government sent 1.1 million Han Chinese cadres to East
Turkistan to control the daily life of Uyghurs. Their job is to stay
in Uyghur homes, share the same bed with them if necessary and to
control all aspects of their daily lives,” the report said. 
“With the ‘Double Relative Program’ initiated by the Beijing
government, Han Chinese cadres make visits at least once every two
months and stay for about a week. During the stay, while constantly
spreading Chinese Communist Party propaganda, they also spy on them.
During these visits, they encourage drinking of alcohol and eat pork,
all of which are forbidden in Islam. If a Uyghur requests ‘halal
meat’ from the market and if they do not drink, they are declared a
suspect and sent to the camps,” the report further said.
In order to disrupt the Uyghur family structure, the Beijing
administration offers the Han Chinese money, jobs and free homes for
arranged marriages, Campaign for Uyghurs stated.
The report said that young girls and women are the worst sufferers
among the Uyghurs. Campaign for Uyghurs Executive Director Rushan
Abbas pointed out that this situation has led to government-sponsored
mass rape. 
The report further stated that the Beijing has breached the
“Prevention of Genocide” contract. 
“As such, the President of the People’s Republic of China, Xi
Jinping, and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Secretary, Chen
Quanguo, and other executives are all responsible and accountable for
these crimes,” the report said.
It has recommended removing China from its participatory status on the

immediate and unfiltered access to the entire region of East
Turkistan.

The Economic Times,2004-07-10 00:00:00,Pench tiger crossing NH-7 raises concern,"Tiger Video grab of a tiger passing the Nagpur-Jabalpur highway.
NAGPUR: A full-grown tiger was caught on video crossing the four-laned
NH-7 along Maharashtra’s Pench Tiger Reserve, and jumping the crash
barrier to cross over to the other side. 
This has once again exposed the inadequate wildlife mitigation
measures by National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) on this
stretch.
A video recorded by travellers going in a car from Paoni to Ramtek
shows a tiger waiting to cross the road near Chorbahuli. They slowed
down and recorded it. The tiger has been identified as T1 of Pench.
The video went viral on social media on Tuesday, stirring a debate on
the importance of the strategy of avoidance and properly locating
mitigation structures using good science.
The tiger moved a few metres ahead and jumped the median barrier to go
towards Chorbahuli forest, which is one of the ranges of Mansinghdeo
sanctuary, now part of Pench. Generally, such movements are reported
during the night but this may be perhaps the first video of a tiger
crossing during the day giving clinching evidence of how tigers risk
their lives to cross the widened NH-7 in forest patches. Had there
been a speeding vehicle coming from the other side, the tiger would
have been knocked down. On July 17, 2018, a leopard was knocked dead
near the spot.
“The Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, in its first
report in 2012 had suggested a 2,000m underpass in the said patch.
However, under political pressure, it was reduced to 750m,” said
wildlife conservationist Prafulla Bhamburkar.
“The spot from where the tiger crossed the highway is 500 metres
away from a 750m and 50m underpass. Had a 2,000m underpass been
constructed, the risk to animals could have been avoided,” said
wildlife lover and intervener Udayan Patil.
“We fail to understand why WII unscientifically reduced the length
of mitigation measures from 2,000m to 750m. This also reflects that
the structures are not fully used and wildlife still faces threat,”
said another conservationist Debi Goenka.
Wildlife biologist Milind Pariwakam says, “The incident highlights
the importance of long-term data sets at a fine scale in road ecology
as a science, which is in its infancy right now in India.”
“We had discussed with NHAI the issue of removing the crash barriers
but these can’t be removed as they prevent accidents. Of the 37km
patch between Chorbahuli-Deolapar, 18km is a dense forested patch but
mitigation structures are built in 2,000m area only, leaving animals
to use open patches to cross over,” said RS Govekar, CCF & field
director, Pench.
On the contrary, WII scientist Dr Bilal Habib, who designed the
mitigation steps, says, “Tigers taking such risks depend on the
volume of traffic. The tiger crossed the road as there was sparse
traffic. There is camera trap evidence that in last three months
tigers crossed the nearby 750m underpass 12 times, including T1, which
crossed it three times. The 50m underpass was also used by a
tigress.”
“It is true T1 had a miraculous escape and that’s why we have
suggested fencing forest patches on both sides so that animals are
diverted to use the underpasses. Removing crash barriers is not a
solution as it will jeopardize human safety,” said Bilal. On
curtailing the size of mitigation measures, Bilal said 20,000km long
roads pass through protected areas in the country. “Conservation
should be sustainable and affordable so that government takes it
positively,” he added.
Patil asked, “Did WII forget these measures when they wrote two
reports. Is it trying to now cover up faults by suggesting fencing?”
Sources said one structure near Chorbahuli was supposed to be 50m long
and 5m high. Initially, NHAI constructed an 8m culvert at the spot.
When the high court ordered a 50m structure, NHAI was reluctant to
build a larger structure and unwilling to dismantle the 8m structure.
Therefore, the 50m structure had to be constructed away from the
originally intended spot, thus leading to a height reduction of 1.5 to
2m. To allow for 5m, NHAI dug the stream bed to increase the height.
This has led to waterlogging.
Patil said, “Due to flooding, the 50m structure is avoided by wild
animals. Central crash barrier on the road was not originally
envisaged but was built by NHAI creating barriers for wildlife.” He
questioned how WII scientists and authorities overlooked such a
crucial aspect.","A video captured a tiger crossing a highway in Pench Tiger Reserve, Maharashtra by jumping a crash barrier, highlighting inadequate wildlife measures. Experts argue a longer underpass suggested years ago could have prevented this, but the highway authority reduced the length for political reasons, ignoring science and leaving animals at risk of accidents.",Local News

impracticability for their opposition, but Goa Forward Party chose
coconuts to drive home its point against the proposal of ‘One

The regional party that is part of the BJP-led Goa government cited
coconut, its party symbol, to argue that regional issues will go

To buttress its reasoning, Goa Forward Party representative cited the
party’s history and struggle in protesting against cutting down of
coconut trees in Goa before it came to power with ally BJP in March
2017.
The party had protested against the previous Laxmikant Parsekarled BJP
government’s decision to amend rules to simplify the procedure of
cutting down coconut trees by removing it from the list of trees, the
representative told commission officials.
This was allegedly done to pave way for real estate and industrial
development at the expense of environment, the party representative
said and cited an example of the former state government receiving a
request to cut down around 800 coconut trees to set up an industry.
The law panel was further told that five months after their party
became part of the government, coconut palm was declared a “state
tree” by the cabinet in August 2017.
The commission recorded objections raised by the party, which argued
that introduction of simultaneous elections will adversely affect
regional parties, and prevent regional issues from being raised and
addressed in the run-up to elections.

The Economic Times,2017-07-10 00:00:00,Here are 9 ways for banks to raise capital to tackle NPAs,"DESPITE BEST EFFORTS, BANKS HAVE NOT FOUND ADEQUATE CAPITAL TO WRITE
OFF BAD ASSETS.
NILESH SHAH
Joint president and MD, Kotak AMC
Shah has over 25 years of experience in capital markets. He has
managed funds across equity, fixed i...Show more »
_Strike at the root, and the branches will fall.
_
Maratha warrior Peshwa Bajirao followed the adage to remain undefeated
throughout his life time. But the Indian banking system, caught in a
fierce battle with non-performing assets (NPAs), does not have
Peshwa’s luck despite help arriving from the Ministry of Finance and
the Reserve Bank of India. The two entities have taken many steps to
contain and reduce NPAs that accumulated as a result of inordinate
delays in project execution, loss of raw material/supply linkage, high
real interest rates and dumping by our trade partners.
Also, gold-plating of projects, faulty planning and poor execution etc
were non-economic reasons for high levels of bad assets in the banking
system.
A host of schemes, such as CDR, SDR, 5: 25 and S4A, had been launched
in the past to reduce NPAs. Introduction of oversight committee along
with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India is the latest step
to ensure a timebound settlement of NPAs.
Despite the efforts, banks have not found adequate capital to write
off bad assets. Over the past three years, the government has provided
Rs 60,000 crore towards recapitalisation, but that has not bridged the
gap between what’s available and what banks require.
Markets refused to give capital to banks battling NPAs as book value
was not taken at stated banks battling NPAs has slowed down to decades
low mid- single digit, impacting investment, job creation and overall
economic growth.
The government doesn’t have space under FRBM framework to
recapitalise banks. The root cause of inadequate Capital to write off
NPAs needs to be tackled along with other steps which are being taken.
Clearly, these are tough times for banks, and desperate times, as they
say, require desperate measures. The following steps can be considered
to raise capital for the banking sector.
1. USE UNCLAIMED DEPOSITS
Many banks have unclaimed deposits (including balances in inoperative
accounts). Many accounts will become inoperative with compulsory
linking of Aadhar card. Such unclaimed deposits can be transferred to
the government with a provision for future claims by the depositors.
The same can be returned to banks as capital. It is extremely unlikely
that depositors will go to the government to claim the deposits. The
government has similar provision for unclaimed dividends.
2. MONETISE ASSETS OF CUSTODIAN OF ENEMY PROPERTY
The Custodian under Enemy Property Act of 1968 has Shares, Securities
and Real Estate valued at more than Rs 100,000 crore, as per a PTI
Report of March 17. The same can be monetised in a time bound and
transparent manner to provide capital to the banking system. Those
unproductive assets can be used more productively through such
monetiation.
3. MONETISATION OF INVESTMENTS HELD BY BANKS
Banks have promoted many nation building institutions like rating
agencies, exchanges and clearing corporations. They also have
investments in financial services like insurance, broking, mutual
fund, housing finance, factoring services etc. Many banks have started
monetising such investments.
It can be explored more with markets lapping up all the recent
issuances. Many banks with retail franchisee will create far more
value through auctioning a bank assurance partnership than running an
insurance company blocking precious capital. 
4. USE OF FX RESERVE À LA CHINA
China had injected more than $60 billion of capital out of its foreign
exchange reserves into its banking system in last decade. Since
Chinese central bank-PBC couldn’t invest in commercial banks
directly, a SPV called The Central Huijin Investment Corporation
Limited (Huijin) was set up to receive funding from the PBC. India has
8th highest FX reserves in the world. Some amount can be borrowed from
the FX reserves to recapitalize the banks.
5. REFINANCE FROM CENTRAL BANK BALANCE SHEET À LA US
US Fed spent $700 billion to purchase stressed assets like mortgage
loans, student loans etc. from banks under TARP in 2008 during
subprime crisis. This was over and above guarantees and refinance of
few trillion dollars. US Fed’s capital adequacy pales against that
of RBI. Some of the stressed assets can be bought by the RBI directly
or through SPV to release NPA pressure from the banking system.
6. TREASURY GAINS TO SET OFF NPAS
Indian Banks are holding Gilts worth Rs 29.5 trillion. 1% reduction in
interest rates can create mark-to-market gains of Rs 1.18 trillion
assuming portfolio duration of four years. Mark-to-market gains on
treasury portfolios can be used to set off NPAs.
The current inflation trajectory is below RBI’s target rate. It is
likely that RBI will succeed in containing inflationary expectations
paving the way for lower interest rates. A fiscally prudent government
an dan independent RBI should be able to achieve lower interest rates.
7. MAKE CRR REMUNERATIVE
Banks have to keep 4 % of deposits in CRR at zero return. This results
into an opportunity loss of Rs 296 billion assuming that banks will be
able to deploy the same at 7%. This is could be a transient step to
help bank provide additional profitability. In the past three years,
paying interest on CRR would have provided more capital to banks than
government’s recapitalisation.
8. SALE AND LEASE-BACK OF ASSETS
The world is struggling for yield. There are more than $9 trillion
worth of bonds at negative yields. FIIs preference of Indians credit
and yield is visible in their investment over last few years. Banks
have real estates at nominal book value in their book. (In the early
90s when I was doing my CA, I was taught that iconic SBI main branch
building in Mumbai was having a book value of Rs 1/-) Banks should be
encouraged (through tax exemption) to do sale and lease-back
transactions to encash capital assets like real estate to unblock
capital. The government can negotiate with sovereign funds,
development agencies to provide low-cost financing for such sale and
lease-back in lieu of exclusive entry in Indian markets.
9. STRUCTURAL IMPROVEMENT TO ATTRACT PRIVATE CAPITAL
Many of the private banks and foreign banks in India as well as abroad
have employees who have their origin in PSU banking system. The market
is unwilling to give capital to banks where there are concerns about
the reported book value.
Market doesn’t like banks where decision making is influenced
externally without accountability. Current compensation structure of
PSU bank also creates doubt about attracting and retaining talents.
There is a need to make structural improvement in the banking system
by making them truly board-governed with appropriate compensation
structure. If the government’s ownership is brought below 51% in
some of the banks to begin with, lot of private capital will be
attracted. It is worth learning from India’s most successful
military chief Peshwa Bajirao to strike at the root to tackle a
problem.
Provision of capital to write down NPAs and structural reforms will
make Indian banking system robust. It is a prerequisite to create
double-digit economic growth for years to come.","The article discusses how despite various schemes and capital injections by the government, banks still lack adequate capital to write off bad assets, slowing economic growth. It proposes nine measures to raise more capital, including using unclaimed deposits, monetising custodian of enemy property assets, selling bank investments and assets, paying interest on reserves, and improving governance structures to attract private capital.",Business and Finance
The Economic Times,2004-07-10 00:00:00,"Bill banning H1-B workers in US has a long road to go: R Chandrashekhar, Nasscom","DATA SHOWS THAT BY 2018 THERE WILL BE MORE THAN ONE MILLION IT SKILLED
JOBS IN THE US THAT WILL REMAIN UNFILLED DUE TO SKILLED PEOPLE NOT
BEING AVAILABLE.
ET Now
_In a chat with ET Now, R Chandrashekhar, President, Nasscom, says
that there is no need for us to get into a frenzy every time such a
bill is introduced. Excerpts:_
ET NOW: IF THE BILL TO PREVENT INDIAN COMPANIES FROM HIRING H1-B VISA
HOLDERS WERE TO BE INTRODUCED IN THE US, HOW MUCH OF A SETBACK THIS
COULD BE FOR THE INDIAN IT SECTOR? R CHANDRASEKHAR: I think this is
not the first of such bills which we have seen. There has been a spate
of bills which have been introduced both in the recent past as well as
some time back. Very few of these have actually come to pass finally
and received the assent of the congress and the senate.
 In fact, the recent bill which was a part of larger appropriations
bill which imposed an additional levy structured in such a manner that
it only impacted Indian companies under this so called 50-50 rule. It
was passed very quickly because it was a part of the appropriations
bill and it was small part of a very large bill that is now in the WTO
and the essence of the argument that India has put up is that these
are discriminatory because they target a specific kind of companies
and while Indian companies are not named as a group, the effect and
the intent both very clearly target Indian companies. So this bill
also is very much of that nature which is discriminatory and which is
a piecemeal legislation.
So from here to finally getting it passed and getting presidential
assent is a very long road and we will have to see how that proceeds
and certainly these are matters of concern and we do see what is
happening but at the same time I do not think that there is a need for
us to get into a frenzy every time such a bill is introduced.
But let me come to the substance of it. This is with regard to the
bill and the mechanics and the discriminatory aspect of it. First and
foremost, the premise that there are enough people who are skilled and
qualified in the US and there is no need for people like this.
 All the data that the US labour department brings out shows that
there is a shortage. In fact, the unemployment rates amongst skilled
workers is around 2 per cent whereas anything below 4 per cent is
regarded as a shortage. So that is one data point.
 The second is that there is data which shows that by 2018 there will
be more than one million IT skilled jobs in the US that will remain
unfilled due to skilled people not being available.
 The third is that more than 50 per cent of enrolment in US
universities for stem programmes is for people of foreign origin. So I
do not think we need to look very far for data that there is shortage
of skilled workers in the US.
ET NOW: LET US JUST TALK FROM THE STANDPOINT OF INDIAN IT COMPANIES.
HOW DETRIMENTAL WOULD THIS BE BECAUSE GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE REVENUE
MODEL OF MAJORITY OF THE BIG IT COMPANIES IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON
THESE H1-B AND LI VISAS IN THE US AND SUCH A BILL WOULD HAVE QUITE A
BIG IMPACT IF NOT SOUNDING THE DEATH KNELL ON THE BUSINESSES FOR SOME.
WOULD YOU AGREE WITH SUCH A DESCRIPTION? R CHANDRASEKHAR: No I think
that again as Mark Twain said the rumours of my death were vastly
exaggerated. So here also I think that while clearly it is something
which would have a huge and a detrimental impact on Indian companies,
it is not as if this is the only yardstick on which they or this is
the only route on which they depend for their business.
A lot of the companies, in fact, have been witnessing a change in the
composition of their workforce not necessarily because of immigration
but more because of business dynamics. Today, companies are being
asked to deliver more in terms of business value, more in terms of
organisational transformation of the clients and not just in terms of
an IT deliverable or for network or a management of a system or
writing a software code.
So the demand of the moment of the client is to use technology but
deliver a business value, a mix of skills that you tends to include a
lot of domain people which typically would be people who are hired
locally because – a) that is not a skill which is in short supply
and b) that is a part of the mix that is required. So this ratio of
visa based workers to local workers has been changing because the
nature of the business itself has been changing.
So 50 per cent people having to depend more than 50 per cent on visa
workers is also something which is more relevant for the era which is
just behind us where they were asked to deliver more on technology
services. Those skills were not available in the US and therefore
there was little option but to depend more on visa workers. Now that
things are changing, this ratio is coming down anyway and in this
definition once company is using less than 50 per cent of visa workers
and they are not covered by this legislation.
So this is the perspective I think which we need to keep in mind and
this transition is happening at its own pace and this kind of
legislation as I said is a long road, the US already has shown a
preference for comprehensive immigration as opposed to this kind of
piecemeal immigration, so let us see.
Connect with Experts - Wealth creation made easy","Data shows there will be over a million unfilled IT jobs in the US by 2018 due to a lack of skilled workers. A proposed bill to restrict Indian companies from hiring H1-B visa holders would negatively impact them as many rely heavily on foreign hiring. However, the IT sector is adapting to changing demands by hiring more local staff and focusing on transformational work over just code writing.",Technology and Gadgets

THAT 66 LIONS HAD DIED IN THE PAST ONE YEAR AND, OF THESE, 55 HAD DIED
OF NATURAL CAUSES.
TNN
AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat government has accepted on the floor of the
state assembly that 66 lions had died in the past one year and, of
these, 55 had died of natural causes.
In reply to a question of Una MLA Punja Vansh, the forest and
environment minister Ganpat Vasava, said that between May 1, 2013 and
April 31, 2014, a total of 66 lions had died in Amreli, Gir Somnath
and Junagadh districts. Of these, 55 had died natural deaths.
The minister further stated that of the 66 lions which had died, 29
were cubs, 16 were lionesses and the rest 21 were lions. The maximum
number of lion deaths - 33 - had occurred in Amreli. Gir Somnath was
next with 19 deaths and the third was Junagadh where 14 big cats had
died. Of the 33 lions which had died in Amreli, 14 were cubs and 13
male lions, said the minister.
Meanwhile, officials in the forest department said that the 29 lion
cubs which had died were in the age group of 0-2 years. They had lost
their lives either during fighting within a pride, while the big cats
were capturing territory or had been devoured by other lions. Citing a
study, he said that only around 56% cubs survive till the age of three
when they leave their pride in search of new territory and pride.
The high survival rate in Gujarat's Gir sanctuary was highlighted in a
study conducted by experts from Wildlife Institute of India, titled
'Reproductive Strategy and Behaviour of Male Asiatic Lions.' The study
also reveals that the survival rate of cubs is lowest in the first
year of birth but gradually increases in the second and third year.

The Economic Times,2013-12-11 00:00:00,"Global economy to pick up pace next year: Mohamed El-Erian, Pacific Investment Management ","MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, THE NEWPORT BEACH, CALIFORNIA-BASED ASSET MANAGER
SAID THE WORLD ECONOMY IS LIKELY TO EXPAND 2.5 PC TO 3 PC IN 2014.
Bloomberg
The world economy will enjoy faster growth next year, as improvement
in the US and the euro area offsets slowdowns in China and Japan, said
Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive officer of Pacific Investment
Management Co.
The Newport Beach, California-based asset manager said the world
economy is likely to expand 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent in 2014, up
from 2.3 per cent this year. US growth will accelerate to 2.25 per
cent to 2.75 per cent from 1.8 per cent.
“The US economy is healing,” he said in an interview yesterday.
“Household balance sheets are in a better place.”
Pimco, which manages $1.97 trillion in assets, sees Chinese growth
slowing to 6.75 per cent to 7.25 per cent from 7.8 per cent over the
last 12 months, according to El-Erian. Japan’s economy will expand 1
per cent to 1.5 per cent, down from 2.4 per cent in 2013.
He said it’s virtually certain the Federal Reserve will begin
moderating its asset purchases by the end of March, with a 50-50
chance of a move next week. He said the Fed is likely to couple any
tapering announcement with a cut in the interest rate it pays on
banks’ excess reserves and a strengthened commitment to keep
monetary policy easy for an extended period.
 The euro-area’s economy will expand by 0.25 per cent to 0.75 per
cent in 2014, after contracting 0.4 per cent this year, he said.
 JOB MARKET
 The Pimco executive said he was heartened by the broad-based
improvement in the US job market last month. Payrolls increased by
203,000, while the unemployment rate fell to 7 per cent from 7.3 per
cent in October, the Labor Department reported on Dec. 6. The
employment-to-population rate also rose while hourly earnings
increased.
“The breadth of improvement was notable,” El-Erian said.
The Fed’s “hyperactive” monetary policy has given the US economy
time to mend after its deepest recession since the Great Depression,
according to El-Erian.
The Fed is buying $85 billion of bonds per month. It has also promised
to keep its target for the federal funds rate near zero at least as
long as unemployment remains above 6.5 per cent and forecast inflation
is not above 2.5 per cent.
“You’re looking at a transition where the Fed will remain engaged
but will alter its policy mix,” by gradually reducing its bond
buying while strengthening its forward guidance on short-term interest
rates, he said.
He said he expects the Fed to cut the 0.25 per cent rate it pays
commercial banks on excess reserves as part of that transition. While
such a move wouldn’t have a “dramatic impact,” it would
underscore the Fed’s commitment to keeping rates low, he said.
MUSHROOMING RESERVES
Banks’ reserves have mushroomed as the Fed purchased securities from
them in its bid to lower long-term interest rates. Banks currently
have more than $2 trillion in extra cash at the Fed, according to data
from the central bank.","The chief executive of Pimco asset management said the world economy is likely to expand 2.5-3% in 2014, up from 2.3% this year, as improvements in the US and Europe offset slowdowns in China and Japan.

According to an official statement issued by the Indian government, the Prime Minister appreciated Google’s partnership with Hewlett Packard (HP) to manufacture Chromebooks in India.

Google recently started producing its Chromebook laptops in India through a partnership forged with HP, in a major boost to the country’s electronics manufacturing ambitions.

The move puts Google among the most high-profile names to kickstart manufacturing in India as companies across the world look to diversify their supply chains in the wake of turbulent geopolitical times.

The Chromebooks — laptops that run on Google’s Chrome operating system — will be manufactured at the Flex facility near Chennai, where HP has been producing a range of laptops and desktops since August 2020. The production has started from October 2 and will cater to the demand for affordable PCs in India, mainly from the education sector.

Chromebooks are among the most popular laptops used in educational institutions worldwide, but are yet to find mainstream traction in India, where laptops running on the Windows operating system continue to rule the roost.

The move will help Google compete more effectively with Windows computers from companies such as Dell, Lenovo, and Asus.

While India has a big domestic demand for laptops and computers, almost all of it is currently being fulfilled by imports from China, something New Delhi wants to change as soon as possible.

India has seen an increase in imports of electronic goods and laptops/computers in the last few years. During April-June this year, the import of electronic goods increased to $6.96 billion from $4.73 billion in the year-ago period, with a share of 4-7 per cent in overall imports.

The highest share of imports is in the category of personal computers, including laptops and palmtops, under which imports from China stood at $558.36 million in April-May this year as against $618.26 million in the year-ago period. China accounts for roughly 70-80 per cent of the share of India’s imports of personal computers, laptops.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi chatted with Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai over a video call about Google's plans to expand electronics manufacturing in India.

The economic times,2013-09-25 00:00:00,US engineering giant Emerson to buy Virgo Valves for 450 million dollars,"MUMBAI: American engineering giant Emerson Group will purchase Pune-based unlisted Virgo Valves and Controls, which makes valves for oil drilling, for about $450 million, said a person with direct knowledge of the development, signaling the continued interest by overseas strategic investors in Indian companies.

""Virgo's leadership in the engineered, on-off valve market is a great strategic fit within our business and strongly complements our Fisher control valve business,"" said Steve Sonnenberg, Emerson's executive vice-president and head, Emerson Process Management segment.

The deal will provide an exit option to Virgo's two founders Mahesh Desai and Balasubramanian after more than two decades along with their private equity investor Tano Capital, while the new acquisition will complement the $24-billion Emerson's Fisher control valve business used in various engineering verticals.
Tano Capital had picked up a stake of 10% stake in Virgo Engineers for $13 million in 2006 valuing the company at $130 million.
The company had attempted to list on the Indian stock exchanges in 2008 and 2010 but failed as it didn't receive what it considered a fair value. Desai and his partner Balasubramanian, both former engineers from Larsen & Toubro, built the company up from scratch and now own four factories in India, the US, Italy and Germany with 900 employees. It supplies products to oil and gas, power and mining companies in 72 countries. Desai owns 32% stake, while 28% is with Balasubramanian. The rest is held by various investors.
""The alliance with Emerson and, in particular, the Fisher line of products, is a continuation of our growth as a global brand,"" said Desai, co-founder and chairman of Virgo. Of the company's $250 million revenue, 80% comes from overseas. Bankers and consultants expect more strategic inbound deals for Indian companies that make niche products.
""The valuation at which this deal is being done is in line with what any high-quality growth business would get globally. We continue to see a lot of strategic interest in the industrials space from European, Asian and US investors,"" said Preet Mohan Singh, executive director and head, industrials, at domestic investment bank Avendus Capital.
Inbound deals to India doubled in the first half of calendar year 2013 from a year ago. Between January and June 2012, there were 76 inbound deals worth $2.97 billion as against 65 deals worth $4.11 billion this year, according to data provided by Grant Thornton India, a global consultancy service.
Some consultants said the rupee's depreciation has heightened the interest of overseas investors. The rupee has depreciated nearly 22% between January and August, but has recovered 9% since then. ""India's attractiveness is always compared to other destinations for such global strategic players and on a medium- to long-term perspective, India continues to be attractive. With the rupee depreciating, it has helped a lot of inbound buyers to firm up their decisions,"" said an investment banker.
","Emerson, a US engineering company, is buying Virgo Valves and Controls, an Indian firm making special valves for oil drilling, for about $450 million. Virgo's founders and their investor will sell their shares. Emerson believes Virgo's valves will be a good addition to their business. This deal is seen as a step in Virgo's global growth. Most of their $250 million revenue comes from other countries. The number of foreign companies investing in India doubled in the first half of 2013 compared to the previous year. The rupee's depreciation has made India more interesting to foreign investors.",Business and Finance
Reuters,2023-10-16 00:00:00,LinkedIn lays off 668 employees in second cut this year,"Oct 16 (Reuters) - Microsoft's (MSFT.O) LinkedIn said on Monday it would lay off 668 employees across its engineering, talent and finance teams in the second round of job cuts this year for the social media network for professionals amid slowing revenue growth.

The cuts, which affect more than 3% of the 20,000-strong staff, add to the tens of thousands of job losses this year in the technology sector in the face of an uncertain economic outlook.

""While we are adapting our organizational structures and streamlining our decision making, we are continuing to invest in strategic priorities for our future and to ensure we continue to deliver value for our members and customers,"" LinkedIn said in a blog on Monday.

The tech sector has laid off 141,516 employees in the first half of the year compared with about 6,000 a year ago, according to employment firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

LinkedIn makes money through ad sales and by charging for subscriptions to recruiting and sales professionals who use the network to find suitable job candidates.

In the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2023 year, LinkedIn's revenue increased 5% year-on-year, compared to 10% in the previous quarter.

Microsoft has cited a slowdown in hiring along with a decline in advertising spending as headwinds for LinkedIn, although it continues to add new members to its community of 950 million.

LinkedIn in May decided to cut 716 jobs across sales, operations and support teams to streamline its operations and remove layers to help make quicker decisions.","Microsoft's LinkedIn is undergoing a second round of job cuts this year, with 668 employees being laid off from its engineering, talent, and finance teams.

Indian Express,2010-05-27 00:00:00,"Govt crushes AI strike; 17 union men sacked, several suspended.","NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: The government on Wednesday crushed the two-day-old strike by Air India unions that was launched 72 hours after the horrific crash at Mangalore and affected about 30,000 passengers.
The union leaders, who were protesting against a gag order, withdrew the strike in the face of a tough management and a Delhi high court order that termed the action illegal and directed the 14,000-odd workers to resume duties immediately.
The AI management, meanwhile, has launched a massive crackdown on the powerful unions. It had by 9pm either dismissed or suspended about 50 union leaders and sources said more action could follow through the night.
The move came even as civil aviation minister Praful Patel said that the unions had gone a bit too far and that the AI management had a free hand in dealing with the issue. By Thursday afternoon, the airline had issued a statement saying that it had never issued a gag order based on which the employees had gone on strike.
AI said the recent order merely reiterated its July 2009 communication, which had said ""...all concerned employees are advised to desist from going public with their statements that have the potential of harming the company's revenue earning possibility"" or they would face disciplinary action.
The striking staff, led by Air Corporation Employees Union office bearers and All India Engineers Association, was scheduled to meet AI CMD Arvind Jadhav at the AI headquarters at 3pm on Wednesday. The meeting, however, kept getting postponed till the HC order was finally announced after which the management stated there was no need for a conciliatory meeting and striking employees would face 'termination' if they did not return to work immediately. AI has reportedly lost Rs 12.5 crore during the agitation.
In the court, Justice Rajiv Sakdher issued a notice to the striking employees union and posted the matter for further hearing on July 13. The ex-parte order was passed on a petition moved by the airline's holding company, NACIL, alleging that the strike by the employees was illegal as the reconciliation process was on.
The company submitted in court that the strike was violative of sections 22 and 24 of the Industrial Disputes Act and that it had caused 50% loss to the airline since Tuesday.
While the staff went back to work on Tuesday night itself, operations are expected to normalize in two to three days as clearing the backlog would take time. The airline is roping in extra staff and is contemplating deploying large aircraft on busy routes to deal with the stranded passengers.
The HC also directed the unions to not go ahead with their proposed strike from May 31. The unions had on May 15 served a mandatory 14 day notice to the management for resorting to strike protesting delay in payment of salaries by a week. NACIL had also moved a vacation division bench of the Bombay high court early in the day. The judges directed NACIL to give ""proper notice to respondent unions"" and posted the matter for hearing on May 28.
The move to crush the strike - which started on the issue of a Kingfisher engineer being asked to clear a relief IA aircraft for take off from Mangalore on Saturday after bringing in coffins and the deceased's relatives - was set in motion by a livid government on Tuesday night itself. With thousands of passengers stranded across the country, Patel spoke to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and finance minister Pranab Mukherjee. Both leaders gave Patel the go-ahead to take appropriate action to end the stir.","The Indian government quickly stopped a two-day strike by Air India unions, which began just 72 hours after a tragic crash in Mangalore, affecting around 30,000 passengers. The union leaders, protesting a restriction on speaking out, ended the strike due to strong management and a court order. The airline's management took stern action, dismissing or suspending about 50 union leaders. The government supported the management's actions. The strike was sparked by a dispute involving a Kingfisher engineer in Mangalore. The government intervened to prevent further disruptions and get flights back on track.",National News

The Telegraph,2018-03-07 00:00:00,Taliban ' s lost parivar found,"ANITA JOSHUAAND DEBRAJ DEB New Delhi/ Agartala: Victorious BJP supporters have accomplished what Indian communists never could: make Vladimir Lenin trend in the country.

As a video clip of Lenin ' s statue being toppled in Tripura where the Left was voted out after 25 years leaped from one phone to another and crossed the border, a social media user in Bangladesh wondered: "" Have Islamists won in Tripura? Why are they breaking statues? "" The reference seemed to be to the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddha statues in Afghanistan in 2001 by the Taliban.


But filmmaker Rakesh Sharma differed with those who compared the "" Hindutva vigilantes "" to the Taliban. "" They ' re pioneers, not copycats! Even when it comes to demolitions.


The Taliban destroyed Bamiyan Buddha statues in March 2001, while Hindutva cadre- kar sevaks demolished Babri Masjid in 1992, more than eight years earlier! "" BJP parliamentarian Subramanian Swamy also sought to draw a distinction by saying the Lenin statue in Tripura was "" not broken "" and his party would send it to the office of the CPM, where communist leaders can worship him.


"" Lenin was a foreigner. He was, in a way, a terrorist because of the number of people he killed there ( in Russia) after imposing dictatorship there.

And ( you) want the statue of such a person erected in our country? "" PTI quoted Swamy as asking.

South Tripura SP Manchak Ipper said Ashish Paul, the driver of the payloader used to topple the statue, had been arrested. Chief ministerdesignate Biplab Kumar Deb said he had not seen the video clip but added that nobody indulging in violence would be spared.

With a constitutional figure and some politicians seemingly endorsing the statue operation, Sangh parivar supporters removed a Lenin bust in Sabroom in South Tripura and set a new goal: bring down Periyar statues in Tamil Nadu.

E. V. Ramasamy or Periyar had pioneered the self- respect movement in Tamil Nadu. A TV channel reported that at least one statue was vandalised in Vellore and two suspects were arrested.


H. Raja, the BJP ' s national secretary, and S. G. Suryah, who calls himself an RSS swayamsevak , posted across social media platforms that Periyar ' s statues would be brought down. The post later disappeared. The BJP was quick to distance itself from Raja ' s post by calling it a personal opinion.

Fellow- travellers of the Sangh parivar wondered why India should offer space for a Lenin statue when it had been brought down across the erstwhile Soviet Union after its collapse. The counter was why what was done after the collapse of a regime should be repeated after a change of guard through the ballot box.


Rakesh Sinha, who heads an RSS- backed think- tank, said the Sangh was not responsible for "" people ' s anger "" and blamed the CPM ' s "" authoritarianism, coercion and the use of state and party apparatus against masses "" . What happened in Tripura stood out in contrast to how earlier governments dealt with colonial statues after Independence.

Historian Narayani Gupta, who was a member of the Delhi Urban Arts Commission, told The Telegraph that most of the colonial era statues were either removed to parks from their vantage locations and some were sold to Canada and Australia. They mostly went into neglect but there was no vandalism as such.

Both the houses and compound wall were set up in an unauthorised way on the land under Tata Steel lease area.

The newly appointed Dhalbhum sub-divisional officer Suraj Kumar, along with the demolition squad comprising deputy superintendent of police (headquarters-I) KN Mishra, officer-in-charge of Sidhgora police station Rajdev Singh and,  about 50 armed policemen and four excavators were involved in the job.

The team pulled down the compound wall being set up around a plot of land measuring more than two acres.

The administration asked all the small vendors, including meat stall and other shops for removing their make-shift structures. Subsquently the squad took a turn toward a locality called China Garden and Shiv Singh bagan area in Agrico under the same police station area.

At China Garden, the administration partially demolished an under-construction three-storeyed building, which belonged to one Bhupendra Singh. The team also demolished a newly built house which belonged to BJP activist Bipin Kumar Singh and later they evicted as many as seven houses in Shiv Singh bagan.

Notably, all the which were demolished were located at a distance of less than one kilometre away from the residence of BJP leader and Chief Minister Raghubar Das.

“We want to continue with our drive to make city encroachment free. We had complaint by the Tata Steel against the land encroachers. We had served notice prior to the drive so that the unauthorised persons may remove their house-hold belongings from their places,” said the Dhalbhum SDO Suraj Kumar.  He said they would lodge FIR against those who had tried to encroach upon the vacant Tata Steel land.

“There were some initial protests before. There is a matter of 86 bustees set up on Tata lease area in the city.  The matter is now pending at a higher level of the State Government for consideration. But as per law no one can set up new houses in any of these 86 bustees,” the Dhalbhum SDO said.

The increasing encroachment on the Government and Tata Steel lease land area particularly on busy market areas has become a matter of concern for the district administration.

Kadma, Bistupur, Sakchi and Jugsalai, which are the busiest areas of the town, over fifty fruit vendors and vegetable sellers have encroached the road and there are always a traffic jam as the fruit vendors have occupied one forth portion of the road, making difficult to move the heavy vehicles.","Continuing with it's effort to make Government land free of illegal constructions, the local administration on Sunday demolished as many as 10 houses and under-construction compound wall razed in Bagan Area under Sidhgora police station area of the city.

Panaji

With Panaji recording high levels of inhalable particulate matter (PM10) multiple times in the last three months, the capital city's air quality deteriorated to the 'moderate' category for a maximum number of the monitoring days in the air quality index.

The air quality in Panaji has fallen from the 'satisfactory' and 'good' category to the 'satisfactory' and 'moderate' category, according to the Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB).

'Moderate' air quality level indicates minor discomfort to sensitive people, while the 'satisfactory' level indicates minor discomfort to children and older people with lung and heart diseases. The GSPCB has noted that the PM10 levels in the city for January, February and March this year have been significantly higher than those recorded during the corresponding period last year. Surprisingly, from January to March this year, there was not a single day with 'good' air quality in Panaji.","The data has exposed an alarming reality, revealing that the inhalable particulate matter (PM10) of less than ten microns in diameter (a fifth the width of a human hair) in the air in Panaji was of unacceptable level for almost half of the monitoring days, that is, out of the total 23 days of monitoring for three months, 12 days reported 'moderate' air quality, posing a health risk to people.

Indian Express,2001-08-16 00:00:00,Rotary Club offers to buy GPS for Kolkata police,"kolkata: in the usa, when a kidnapping happens for a ransom, the first thing that the police uses is a gadget called the global positioning system (gps). in india, only the mumbai police uses it. in kolkata the police have only heard of it, and it may take decades and 20 more kidnappings before it is acquired, feels senior criminologist, raman khanna. khanna has worked as consulting criminologist with police forces not only in major cities in india and abroad. he did his doctoral research in criminology from oldham college, england, where he resided before deciding to finally return to india and settle in kolkata. ""if a person is kidnapped and a relative is taking the ransom money to a pre-decided place, the police would provide him with a bag in which to carry the money. the bag is nothing but a part of the gps gadget. a computer with the police are able to trace the position of the bag as it moves and finally the police are able to identify the spot"", khanna explains, adding that this is just one of the many popular ways in which a gps is used by the police. he compares the geographical position of bengal with that of usa, ""just as a kidnapper here might cross the border and take his hostage to bihar or orissa, similarly, a kidnapper in texas generally crosses the district and goes into hiding in minnesota."" but while it takes a long time for the police of our two states to co-ordinate and crack down on the criminals, ""there all kidnapping cases are handled by the fbi alone, so naturally communication is much speedier, naturally their results are much better."" khanna feels that after the roy burman case the police in bengal have suddenly sat up, ""but this should have happened long ago. though the people are generally aware of the two kidnappings - that of the exide boss s.b. ganguly and this one, actually there have been quite a few kidnappings in this city involving businessmen in the past five years. though these haven't got much publicity, the police were aware of each individual case and by now they should have been better prepared to handle kidnappings"". kidnapping as a crime is about five years old in this city, khanna says, adding that apart from gadgets, what the police require is also a trained negotiator to talk to the kidnappers over ransom. ""what can be more primitive than leaving it on desperate family members to do it."" khanna says that while in mumbai, where the incidence of kidnapping is the highest, the police have already started cataloguing patterns of crime, criminal gangs and their areas of operation. ""no such thing exists here."" khanna works in close association with the enforcement branch of the city police, to nab people who manufacture items or drugs duplicating trademarks of corporates houses, in his capacity as director of hawk intelligence services private limited. khanna, an assistant governor of the rotary club, says, "" rotary clubs have ample funds to buy interceptive gadgets like gps for our police, because on consulting senior officers of the police over this i have been told that though they are eager, they hardly have funds. i will soon meet the chief minister and discuss the matter with him.""","In the USA, the police use a gadget called the Global Positioning System (GPS) to track kidnappings for ransom. However, in India, only the Mumbai police have adopted this technology. Kolkata, for instance, is yet to acquire and implement GPS for such purposes, which senior criminologist Raman Khanna believes may take decades and more kidnappings before it is adopted. GPS can be crucial in tracking ransom payments and identifying the location of the ransom drop. Khanna highlights the importance of GPS in resolving kidnapping cases and mentions the need for trained negotiators to communicate with kidnappers during ransom negotiations. He also emphasizes the need for better coordination and data cataloging within the police force to effectively combat kidnapping crimes.

""the method we used for evaluation is called 'the structure of observed learning (solo) taxonomy' developed by biggs and collis (1982) and aimed at finding out the discrepancies between formal learning and the quality of learning among the student population. we wanted to determine efficiency of formal school education or school effectiveness. though there are different yardsticks, we took the madhyamink as an index of formal learning"" he said. the study classified the 297 (161 male and 137 female) students in five categories. the highest category students are expected to provide a comprehensive explanation including content both from the text as well as knowledge outside the text. (students able to give references, common experiences, opinions, suggestions) no student could score enough to be in the highest category.

Funded by the Department of Science and Technology, the project uses portable steam cylinders charged by renewable energy-based stations (like solar energy) that are placed strategically in rural areas for power generation, steam generation and other uses. The team also designed special sterilisation chambers to utilise such portably stored steam and effectively sterilise the tools.

A portable steam storage canister can be a great contribution by facilitating minor medical interventions in the developing world by sterilising surgical instruments and combating infections in rural areas, said Prof. Sathyan Subbiah, Department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Madras, in a statement.

The portable canister is developed with multi-layer insulation, which can retain useful heat of steam, generated via solar plants for longer duration thus making it a viable option to sterilise equipment in remote areas.

The steam that is produced in the solar plant or any other means can be stored in the portable canister which can be transported to remote locations to carry out the sterilisation activities, he added.

The Imphal Free Press,2023-10-17 00:00:00,Arms and the man,"Many had condemned the looting of arms and ammunition from police armouries in the early days of the unrest which began on May 3, 2023. We shall not go into the matter of where exactly did the looting of guns started as it happened in both hills and the valley, although some vested interests are trying to spread the message that it happened in the valley only.


Yes, one cannot agree more with the fact that the number of arms looted in the valley are huge in figures. Yet, it would be more prudent to start with a question as to how well armed are the civilian population in the state. In the valley, it is mostly VVIPs and neo-rich who are licence holders of arms while in the hills even the common folk own licence guns for purposes of hunting or otherwise. And of course, there is the factor of unaccounted guns including the country-made variety which one has seen in recent times.


So, when the present unrest and attacks from the surrounding hills started there were only a few licensed guns in the peripheral villages which was a pittance as compared to the licensed guns in the hills and the sophisticated variety which was supposed to be in the Malkhanas of designated SoO camps.


And the need to arm themselves and protect their villages practically forced them in the direction of police armouries. The question of justification aside, that is exactly how it happened. And that is why, the womenfolk in the valley protested the arrest of village volunteers and combing operations aimed at gathering the looted weapons. Their basic argument is that, if at all there has to be operations it should be both in the hills and the valley and again the sporadic attacks and frequent clashes should be put to a stop before such operations.","On the other hand, a general notification issued through the District Magistrates of various districts has asked the holders of arms licenses issued by the magistrate to submit the arms licenses along with the registered arms by March 1 to the respective police stations as mentioned in the arms license.


Failing to comply with the notification will result in the cancellation of the license without further notice, it had added. Now, district authorities need to come up with reports on this. It might be said now that, the general situation is slowly inching towards normalcy with occasional incidents. There is also a need to address the issue of armed gunmen looting houses and creating panic among the general population.


The other day, some gunmen fired at an unsuspecting crowd injuring five innocents. Before that, a house in Imphal East was robbed of jewellery and cash and a hand grenade was left at the residence of a member of Youth of Manipur. There might be numerous unreported incidents involving guns also as there are still so many guns at large.",International News

The Goa Chronicle ,2023-10-17 00:00:00,I am not a religious person but a Sanatan Dharma follower,"I am just a seeker in life. I have stopped running. Instead, I have started looking within and around me.

I am not a propagator of religion. I believe that religion and the interpretations of religion are root causes to conflict all around the world.

Religion preaches peace but propagators of religion act in a manner that leaves the world in pieces.

At the base point of any religion is a God and a Human. But often in religious tensions, God and Human both are forgotten.

I was born into the Christian religious faith but my ancestral roots are Indic.

I am aware that a duress or an allurement or simple faith would have led to their conversion centuries ago when Goa witnessed a brutal inquisition.

Sometimes, I get advised on social media and outside by some proponents of the Hindu religion that I should convert from Christianity to the Sanatan Dharma faith.

Their advice, I believe come from their limited understanding of Sanatan Dharma and Christianity.

Christianity is a religious faith centred around the belief of salvation if you believe or damnation if you do not believe in the path professed under the Christian faith. I have grown up believing in some of its tenets and also questioning some of its tenets.

I believe in the teachings of Jesus for its simplicity and its application in real life with people around you.

The Bible teaches us that Jesus gave his disciples two commandments: Love God with all your heart and mind. And to love your neighbour as you, love yourself.

I have read the Bible several times and there are many wonderful passages in it that help you learn and deal with life’s challenges. There are lessons to learn from it but it is not life.

I am not blind to the truth that the Catholic Church as an institution has sinned in its numerous discretions over the centuries when it shaped itself into an organised religion. However, errs of an institution, may or may not be the fault lines of a faith.

For most of my growing up years as a Christian, I have always quested to understand the truth of life. In fact, my knowledge on the tenets of the Christian faith comes from my mother’s simple understanding of the teachings imparted by the Catholic Church on Christianity.

The Christian faith does not teach you to hate. However, some representatives of Christian institutions in their zealous drive to proselytize, while intending to propagate hope and peace, resort to propagating hate and fear. The intent is to convey that the Christian God is the real God and every other God is a false God. Sadly, it is here that the fallacy emerges.

Growing up, I too was sceptical and questionable about the religious practices of other faiths, but I was never taught to mock or disrespect them, I just did not understand them.

Knowledge has been my pursuit and wisdom has been my guide. The religious journey that started in Christianity led me to quintessential question that bothers most seekers of the truth ‘If God created humans, humans will bear an imprint of its creator and therefore humans should have some God-like qualities. Therefore, ‘Who am I’?”

The search got me to look into my cultural roots and I found my Vedic roots in India. Most of life’s simple questions found its answers when I looked at the question from the eyes of Vedic knowledge and science.

The most important realisation that dawned on me is Sanatan Dharma is not a dogmatic practice or dependence of religious texts to commune with God. The energy, we call God, lies within you and around you. To know God is to know yourself.

Good and evil are not separate manifestations. Humans are both good and evil. Good when they act in the interest of others, bad when they act in the interests of themselves. Just like nature, when nature unleashes its fury, it destroys all in its path, when it chooses to caress it is ethereal and nurtures all in its path.

Sanatan Dharma teaches me that I am in this life because of the karmas that I may or may not carry from another life time. Yet, the most important moot point is that my actions in my current life will decide the outcomes in my current life and my future lives too.

Religion is too small in front of the tenets and philosophies of Sanatan Dharma, because it goes beyond religion and strides in the realm of spirituality.

Our dharma is to live out our lives in a Sanatan way, meaning in an eternal way, because our souls carry on for eternity because it is a form of energy, it moves forward or backward but it never stops moving.

Our dharma is to walk our path of destiny, whether we believe it is preordained or not preordained; with honesty, purity, goodwill, mercy, patience, forbearance, self-restraint and generosity.

In today’s world, sadly, most of us humans are lost. We believe that a religious tag defines our existence. Are you a Christian? Are you a Muslim? Or are you a Hindu?

Sanatan Dharma is not a religious tag. Simply put, it is your soulful and human existence. We fail to look within and we end up seeing it through a religious prism.

I am a father to two daughters; I love both of them. I will not let any one of my daugthers to be harmed. I will not choose between both of them, because I love both of them equally.

That to me is seeing life through the eyes of Sanatan Dharma, God does not choose one because that person belongs to a particular religion. I believe, God sees you for who you are at that point of time and if God wants to touch your life, God will.

Jesus and Lucifer, Ram and Raavan come from one universal energy source; one exhibits positive energy and the other negative energy because of their decisions.

Humanity is the reality of life and not religious bias. If we fail to see God in another human or in a creation of nature, because our religion teaches us otherwise, then our religion is wrong","I am just a seeker in life. I have stopped running.

the imphal free press,2020-06-27 00:00:00,Artificial Intelligence in 21st Century,"In Computer Science, artificial intelligence (AI) is sometimes called machine intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans. Colloquially, the term AI is often used to describe machines (or computers) that mimic cognitive functions that humans associate with the human mind such as learning and problem solving. As machines becomes increasingly capable, task considered to require “intelligence “are often removed from the definition of AI by a phenomenon known as the A.I effect. In 21st century, AI techniques have experienced a resurgence following concurrent advances in computer power, large amounts of data and theoretical understanding; and AI techniques have become an essential part of the technology, industry, helping to solve many problems in computer science, software engineering and operation research.
Computer science defines AI research as the study of “intelligent agents”: any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. A more elaborate definition of characterizes AI as “a system’s ability to correctly interpret external data, to learn from such data and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation. Compared with humans, existing AI lacks several features of human “common sense reasoning”, most notably humans have powerful mechanisms for reasoning about “naïve physics” such as space, time and physical interactions. This enables even young children to easily make inferences. Humans also have a powerful mechanism of “folk psychology” that helps them to interpret natural language sentences. This lack of common knowledge means that AI often makes different mistakes than humans make in a way that can seem incomprehensible. 


There are four types of Artificial intelligence viz: reactive machines; limited memory; theory of mind & self-awareness. Theoretical AI says that intelligence ( be it natural or artificial) has three types: Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI); Artificial General Intelligence (AGI); Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI). Artificial Intelligence (AI) is bringing drastic changes in technological fields, where it can be implemented to automate the system for more efficiency and performance. AI is now getting used in multiple fields from simply your mobile phone to diagnosing the diseases providing a high –performance and accurate system work with efficiency.


Alexa, Siri and Google Assistance are the virtual assistance services while automated bots answering the questions of customers are AI-based chatbots working with best performance.


In agriculture sector Autonomous Tractors and Drone monitoring are used to enhance the productivity and crop yield of farmlands. Robots and automated machines are also used in these fields to monitor the health condition of crop and harvesting. Autonomous Vehicles or Self-driving Cars are the other examples of AI, fully integrated into such system to make the machine work automatically while understanding the nearby surroundings and real life scenario of the environment.

AI based face recognition and biometric system helping to keep track the humans’ beings and provide them a safe zone to live. Security cameras and other surveillance equipment’s are widely used to keep the cities and habitat safe. Automated warehousing and supply chain management is reducing the manpower and helping storage companies to manage the huge amount of stock  or inventory with proper management and supply system.


This system is also helping e-commerce sector to operate with better efficiency and improve their operating margins. AI-based automated warehousing management system is not only getting benefits but machine learning is improving the online shopping experience of customers. This technology is also providing the insights or the customers to companies using the sentiment and analysis services to understand their customers’ sentiments and offer them better products and services to gain more market share in the industry.


Similarly, in healthcare sector, AI is playing a vital role in empowering the machines to diagnosis, analyse and predict the various types of diseases, monitor the patients’ health conditions and help scientists to explore the new drug discoveries and medicine development helping people to get well soon and avoid health problems in their life.


However, AI is possible into these things only when a model is well trained through right machine learning data using suitable algorithms to make it fully functional into their relevant fields. Java, Python, Lisp, Prolog and C++ are major AI programming language used for AI capable of satisfying different needs in the development and designing of different software.


Artificial intelligence (AI) is doing a lot of good and will continue to provide many benefits for our modern world, but along with the good, there will inevitably be negative consequences. The sooner we begin to contemplate what those might be, the better equipped we will be to mitigate and manage the dangers.


Legendary physicist “Stephen Hawking” shared this ominous warning: “Success in creating effective AI could be the biggest event in the history of our civilization or the worst”. So we cannot know if we will be infinitely helped by AI or ignored by it and side-lined or conceivably destroyed by it. The first step is being able to prepare for the negative impact of artificial intelligence is to consider what some of those negative impacts might be.


Since AI algorithms are built by humans, they can have built-in bias by those who either intentionally or inadvertently introduce them into the algorithm. If AI algorithms are built with a bias or the data in the training sets they are given to learn from is biased, they will produce result that are biased, this reality could lead to unintended consequences.","Artificial intelligence (AI) is doing a lot of good and will continue to provide many benefits for our modern world, but along with the good, there will inevitably be negative consequences.

Parliament expanded its ambit over J&K in big way after 1950
Parliament has passed 53 J&K related amendments, of which 52 came under Congress regimes
NEW DELHI: When Pakistan-backed attacks made then J&K monarch Hari Singh to hurried abandon the dream of keeping his princely state independent and sign the Instrument of Accession on October 26, 1947, he had handed over to India full control over only three subjects — defence, external affairs and communications.


In his letter to then governor general LordMountbatten pleading for accession to India, Singh had mentioned Pakistan-backed fighters overrunning the state.
“The number of women who have been kidnapped and raped makes my heart bleed. The wild forces thus let loose on the state are marching on with the aim of capturing Srinagar... as the first step to overrunning the whole state,” he said.
Part of a five-judge bench-led by CJI D Y Chandrachud which is hearing the challenge to abrogation of Article 370, JusticeSanjay Kishan Kaul, whose ancestry is deeply rooted in Kashmir, said, “I understand the infiltrators were seven miles from Srinagar (when Indian forces stopped them and later evicted them).”


Appearing for National conference leaderMohammad Akbar Lone, senior advocate Kapil Sibal said the Instrument of Accession allowed the government of India to have control over defence, external affairs and communications.
However, he admitted that over the years,Parliament has passed as many as 53 amendments to the Constitution (Application to J&K) Order, 1950. This means apart from the three major subjects of defence, external affairs and communications, Parliament has steadily applied the provisions of the Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir, despite the state’s Constituent Assembly framing a separate constitution for J&K in 1957.


Of the total 54 such orders, including the first one in 1950, 52 were passed by Parliament till 1996, a period of nearly five decades when Congress was at the helm of governance in the country. The Constitution (Application to J&K) Amendment orders in 2017 and 2019 were passed during the NDA regime. The 2017 order extended the GST regime to the state.
The 1950 order said the government of India would have power to make laws that would apply to J&K on subjects relating to all matters of defence and armed forces; arms, firearms and explosives; atomic energy; preventive detentions relating to defence, foreign affairs and security of India; foreign affairs, diplomatic relations and UN; extradition; admission, emigration and expulsion from India; pilgrimage to places outside India; railways; airways; posts and telegraph; trade and commerce with foreign countries; salaries of MPs from J&K; any investigation on subjects aforementioned.","Parliament expanded control over Jammu and Kashmir after 1950, following Hari Singh's accession to India. While Singh initially granted control over defense, external affairs, and communications, Parliament passed 53 amendments applying constitutional provisions to J&K. These included subjects like defense, foreign affairs, railways, and more. The Constitution (Application to J&K) Amendment orders, including GST extension, were passed, with 52 under Congress rule and two during the NDA regime. The challenge to Article 370 abrogation is being heard by a five-judge bench, with Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul remarking on infiltrator threats near Srinagar.

The Economic Times,2010-02-24 00:00:00,The Cadbury kraft marriage is made in heaven,"Sanjay Khosla was in India for a two day visit with his top team to meet the Indian leadership and visit the marketplace. Having lived and worked around the world, Sanjay calls himself a global citizen. He was with Fonterra Co-operative Group, a multinational dairy company based in New Zealand before coming to Kraft Foods. At Fonterra, Sanjay served as Managing Director of the company's consumer and foodservice business. During that time, he helped turn around the consumer business.

Before joining Fonterra in 2004, Sanjay spent 27 years with Unilever in India, London and Europe. He most recently served as Senior Vice President, Global Beverages and Chairman of Unilever's $4 billion beverages category. The business saw accelerated growth worldwide as a result of the ""Paint the World Yellow with Lipton"" business programme. Excerpts from an interview with ET.

You have been in the market place checking out Cadbury’s India story. How do you see one-time competitors, Kraft-Cadbury combine operating in the same place?
I have just been out there this morning with Anand and his team and the energy is just phenomenal in this country. The buzz is so infectious and the excitement around Cadbury in the marketplace is so evident. India is home for me and I am glad to be here. And this Cadbury-Kraft marriage is made in heaven as far as the distribution is concerned.

I have seen Cadbury brands on one aisle and Kraft on the other in the bazaar and with cheese and biscuits on one side and chocolates and confectionery on the other and we have a winning portfolio. I have personally grown up on Cadbury roast almond which back then was so very aspirational and so it is now a dream come true.

Our strategy has been clearly focus on few things and doing them well. It is what we call the strategy of 5-10-10, focus on 5 categories, 10 markets and 10 brands. And one of the 10 markets now is India which is of strategic importance going forward. In fact, the Cadbury acquisition was aimed primarily at getting a footprint in markets like India.

Is there a separate growth strategy for emerging markets? Will the India plan be different since it has negligible presence here unlike other markets such as China.

While we have grown our business organically in emerging markets, we also did two acquisitions. Danone Biscuits has been a very successful integration and we have grown 12 % in emerging markets with a profit growth of 24.2% in last three years..So through organic and inorganic growth, we have turnaround the business. Like I said a clear focus has helped, we are not looking at planting a flag in every operating market. Going ahead, in India snacks, biscuits and chocolates will be the focus areas.The Cadbury acquisition gives a footprint in the distribution and it is impressive to see the growth of Cadbury in the country.

So there is a lot that has to learn from developing markets such as India where we have just a bit of presence. I am delighted that the acquisition came through , it is nice to come back to Bombay where I have lived several years. We have just appointed the leadership team. Anand Kripalu has now been given a cluster of countries for the Kraft Cadbury combine. We have appointed key leaders last night.

At this point of time, Anand will be heading the combined business inthe country and over a period of time India will be used as a source of talent. We will also get people from Kraft into India. As we see now, Cadbury India is a very great working structure with a great leadership team in place.","Sanjay Khosla, The chairman and CEO of Kraft Foods was in India for a couple of days visit to meet with India's leading industrial and market powers. He showed his excitement for the Cadbury-Kraft merger and quotes that it is a ""marriage made in heaven"" as far as distribution is concerned. He sees India as a strategic market for Kraft and says that snacks, biscuits, and chocolates will be the focus areas as we advance.

The Economic Times,2015-01-01 00:00:00,"Government slashes import tariff value on gold, silver  ","NEW DELHI: The government today reduced import tariff value on gold to USD 392 per 10 grams and on silver to USD 519 per kg in line with global price trends. The tariff value on imported gold was at USD 396 per 10 grams and for silver, it was at USD 561 per kg in the second fortnight of December 2014. The import tariff value is the base price at which customs duty is determined to prevent under-invoicing. It is revised on a fortnightly basis taking into account global prices. The reduction in tariff value on imported gold and silver has been notified by the Central Board of Excise and Customs, an official statement said.
Globally, gold and silver prices were volatile towards the end of 2014. In London, gold prices ruled down at USD 1195 an ounce and silver at USD 15.97 on December 31. Last month, India -- the world's largest consumer of gold -- further eased import curbs by scrapping the controversial 80:20 scheme, under which importers were mandated to export 20 percent of the total exports. A recent report commissioned by Wold Gold Council (WGC) has suggested that India should move beyond import curbs and should come up with a national gold policy to put an estimated 22,000 tonnes of idle gold assets into active use.
The report also recommended the launch of several investment products, the establishment of a Gold Board for managing import-export, developing accredited refineries, driving gold monetization by incentivizing banks and introducing compulsory quality certification of gold.","The Indian government has lowered the import tariff value for gold to $392 per 10 grams and for silver to $519 per kg, aligning with global price trends.

In the absence of effective legal oversight, it threatens the democracy it was bought to defend.
In the summer of 1999, an officer at a Research and Analysis Wing communications station in western India flipped a switch, and helped change the course of the Kargil conflict. RAW's equipment had picked up Pakistan's army chief and later military ruler, Pervez Musharraf, speaking to his chief of staff, General Muhammad Aziz, from a hotel room in Beijing. “The entire reason for the success of this operation,” the RAW officer heard General Aziz saying on May 29, 1999, “was this total secrecy.” He probably smiled. For the first time, India had hard evidence that Pakistan's army, not jihadists, had planned and executed a war that had brought two nuclear-armed states to the edge of a catastrophic confrontation.

Indian Express,2023-10-18 00:00:00,Would bring down any government': Rahul Gandhi cites report on Adani coal price,"Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday claimed that the Adani group over-invoiced coal imports, leading to a hike in electricity prices. Citing media sources, he said the Adani group took away a total of Rs 32,000 crore from people in the process.
Addressing a press conference in New Delhi, Rahul Gandhi said, ""Gautam Adani buys coal in Indonesia, and by the time it reaches India, its price doubles. He has taken approximately Rs 32,000 crore from the pockets of the poorest people in India.""
He said after coming to power in Karnataka, the Congress had subsidised electricity and had plans to do the same in Madhya Pradesh if back in power. He said consumers must understand that their bills were increasing because Adani had scammed them.

He said the reputed British newspaper, Financial Times, had done a story called “Adani and mysterious coal prices” but the issue is never discussed in India.
""He (Adani) takes money from the poorest people. This story would bring down any government. This is direct theft,"" he said.

“Adani has been saved again and again by PM Modi. I don't understand why the Prime Minister never comments on this issue,” he said.

He asked why no action was being taken against Adani.

The Congress leader’s claims came a week after the Adani Group issued a statement accusing UK-based media outlet Financial Times (FT) of running a ""malicious campaign"", alleging that the media outlet has been recycling old and unsubstantiated allegations to harm the global reputation of the conglomerate.

In a detailed statement, the Adani Group condemned what it referred to as the FT's ""extended campaign"" to serve undisclosed interests under the guise of public concern.","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday accused the Adani Group of over-invoiced coal imports, citing global media reports.

“This study says that if you lose weight before you start the drug, you can then add a lot more weight loss after,” said Dr. Thomas Wadden, a University of Pennsylvania obesity researcher and psychology professor who led the study.

The results, which were also presented Sunday at a medical conference, confirm that the drug made by Eli Lilly & Co. has the potential to be one of the most powerful medical treatments for obesity to date, outside experts said.

Tirzepatide targets two hormones that kick in after people eat to regulate appetite and the feeling of fullness communicated between the gut and the brain. Semaglutide, the drug used in Ozempic and Wegovy, targets one of those hormones.

The new study, which was funded by Eli Lilly, enrolled about 800 people who had obesity or were overweight with a weight-related health complication — but not diabetes. On average, study participants weighed about 241 pounds (109.5 kilograms) to start and had a body-mass index — a common measure of obesity — of about 38.

After three months of intensive diet and exercise, more than 200 participants left the trial, either because they failed to lose enough weight or for other reasons. The remaining nearly 600 people were randomized to receive tirzepatide or a placebo via weekly injections for about 16 months. Nearly 500 people completed the study.

Participants in both groups lost about 7% of their body weight, or almost 17 pounds (8 kilograms), during the diet-and-exercise phase. Those who received the drug went on to lose an additional 18.4% of initial body weight, or about 44 pounds (20 kilograms) more, on average.

The Economic Times,2015-01-01 00:00:00,Northern India will continue facing bursts of cold waves,"NEW DELHI: The freezing weather in northern India is likely to continue, and people should get used to more and more extreme weather phenomena, whether it is rain, heat, dry patches or unusually cold winters, weather scientists and climatologists say. Experts say that melting Arctic glaciers have increased prospects of “cold snaps” in the northern hemisphere, making the bursts of cold weather even more extreme. Scott Robeson, professor at Indiana University Bloomington, who has analysed global temperature since 1881 finds that extremes of cold, as well as heat, continue to rise. Greenhouse gas emissions are making matters worse.The extreme weather, which has disrupted trains and flights, is not entirely due to climate change. It seems to be a combination of natural weather phenomena aggravated by climate change, scientists say. “The current cold and low temperatures were expected. These are indications of snowfall in higher altitudes, resulting in cold wind being driven to the plains, and the fog keeps the day time temperatures low, making it colder,” explained climate scientist Ajit Tyagi, who holds the Koteswaram chair in the ministry of earth sciences. “While the current weather events may be part of the natural cycle, it is possible that these are being aggravated because of climate change, which scientists have said with increasing certainty is due to human activity,” said Tyagi. DS Pai of the National Climate Centre at the India Meteorological Department said current weather conditions were being aggravated by fog.“The minimum temperatures are rising much faster, that is in keeping with global warming. The frequency of cold waves is declining. What is being experienced now are some weather variations, which will stop after a few days. It is being aggravated by fog, which is on account of moisture in the air and pollution that limits sunshine during the day, prolonging the misery of the cold,” he told ET.The current dip in temperatures, meteorologists say, is on account of a fresh western disturbance in Jammu and Kashmir from Saturday onwards, which has meant lower-than-normal temperatures in north India’s plains. Maximum day temperatures in the region being recorded are as much as 10 degrees Celsius below normal on average. Judah Cohen, a climate modeler at the consulting firm Atmospheric and Environmental Research in Lexington, Massachusetts, and his colleagues Jason C Furtado, Mathew A Barlow, Vladimir A Alexeev and Jessica E Cherry found that despite global average temperatures rising since the late 1800s, with the most rapid warming occurring in the last 40 years, winters in the northern hemisphere have grown colder and more extreme. Their research finds that the strong warming in the Arctic in recent decades has along with other factors led to widespread melting of sea ice. The increase of water in the Arctic Ocean has led to more evaporation, which moisturises the overlying atmosphere to increased cloudiness over the ocean during the following autumn.As a result, there is increased snow coverage as winter approaches. Snow cover in October has the largest effect on weather in the following months, as it creates a semi-permanent high-pressure system, which steers frigid air southward to mid-latitude regions throughout the winter.“After some time the cold winds will stop, and then the mercury will rise,” said Pai. Meteorologists say once the disturbance in Jammu and Kashmir moves away, the sky will clear, allowing for ample sunshine and the maximum temperature will rise. Stressing that the current bout of cold is a weather variation, Tyagi says that “with climate change, weather variabilities will increase.”","Northern India is experiencing extreme cold weather, and experts suggest that such weather events, including cold snaps, are on the rise due to melting Arctic glaciers and climate change. Although natural weather patterns play a role, climate change exacerbates the situation. Low temperatures and fog have disrupted transportation, and while this cold weather may be part of a natural cycle, it's being aggravated by climate change, which is largely attributed to human activity. The extreme cold is expected to subside as the weather disturbance passes, but experts warn that climate change will lead to increased weather variability.",Politics

State-run oil marketing companies have decided against cutting petrol and diesel prices. Instead, the companies would absorb the benefits of falling crude oil prices to meet their inventory losses. The industry was expecting fuel companies to reduce petrol and diesel prices by at least Rs 2 per litre because of the steep fall in international oil rates.

The Economic Times,2015-01-01 00:00:00,Private power companies may shift to regulated tariff regime,"NEW DELHI: The government is considering giving a one-time option to private power companies to shift to regulated electricity tariff from tariff discovered through competitive bidding. The power ministry has agreed to look into a long-pending demand from private power developers that will help about Rs 4 lakh crore stressed plants recover adequate tariffs and cover costs. The ministry has appointed a committee consisting of electricity regulators to conduct a comparative study between competitive tariff and regulatory tariff. A senior power ministry official said the proposal is being considered based on demand from power companies and suggestion from a working group constituted by the finance ministry to resolve financing issues to power plants.The committee under the chairmanship of IIFCL chairman Santosh Nayar suggested offering one-time shift of stressed assets from competitive bidding regime to regulated tariff regime. The power ministry official said such shift in tariff derivation has also been seconded by the advisory committee led by railway minister Suresh Prabhu that said the bid documents should provide for absorption of costs that arise due to issues outside the control of developers. Power plant developers have been demanding a one-time window for migration to regulatory tariffs after they faced issues like high imported coal costs due to changes in Indonesian laws, steep rupee depreciation, nonavailability of coal and gas, high inflation and interest rates or lack of power purchase contracts. While the regulated tariffs are governed by section 62 of the Electricity Act, section 63 covers the competitive tariffs discovered through by state distribution companies. About 80% of the installed 1,53,000-mw coal-based power generation capacity is operating under section 62 under which the tariffs are determined by regulatory commission. Section 63 does not provide for revision in tariffs for factors beyond the control of the developers. Association of Power Producers director general Ashok Khurana said tariff determination through section 62 provides flexibility for adjustment of uncontrollable factors unlike price discovery under section 63 which is very rigid and expects the bidder to predict 25 years price movement of uncontrollable factors – fuel, foreign exchange and interest rates. “The outcome of the rigid process is evident as more than 90% of the plants which have tariff discovered under section 63 have requested for tariff revision on grounds of uncontrollable factors. The answer lies in a one-time dispensation allowing for redetermination of tariffs for the affected projects so that these projects don’t get mothballed. For the future projects, a mix of tariff discovered under section 63 (competition on the basis of fixed cost during construction stage) and tariff determined under section 62 (for the operational life of the plant) will derive the best advantage for consumers,” Khurana said.Khurana claimed that the proposed shift will lead to about 50% lesser power tariffs compared to recently discovered tariff through bidding of .`5 – 6 per unit. Meanwhile, the ministry has decided to cancel the bidding for two ultra mega power projects after all private companies withdrew their bids protesting new bidding framework.","The government is considering allowing private power companies to switch from competitive tariff bidding to regulated electricity pricing, addressing the demands of power developers with stressed plants. A committee of electricity regulators will study the comparative advantages of both systems, with the potential shift being prompted by issues like high coal costs and factors beyond the developers' control, providing flexibility for tariff adjustment. This change could result in significantly lower power tariffs compared to recent competitive bidding prices. Additionally, the government has canceled bidding for two ultra mega power projects due to private companies' objections to the new bidding framework.",Industry
The Economic Times,2015-01-01 00:00:00,Dr Shailesh Nayak given additional charge as Space Secretary,"BENGALURU: In an unprecedented move, the government appointed Shailesh Nayak, secretary of the department of earth sciences, as the interim secretary of the department of space. Its current secretary, K Radhakrishnan, retired on Wednesday after two extensions. Radhakrishnan is also chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), but the government did not appoint a new chairman. It is the first time in its history that ISRO has been left without a chairman. The situation is the fallout of PM Narendra Modi’s decision to deny extensions to most retiring officials. It was widely felt within ISRO and outside that Kiran Kumar, director of the Space Applications Centre in Ahmedabad, will take over from Radhakrishnan.

On Wednesday the Maharashtra Home department headed by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis forwarded the file for an ‘open inquiry’ against Former Maharashtra Water Supply and Sanitation Minister Laxman Dhoble in a disproportionate assests case to the Chief Secretary Swadhin Kshatriya. Dhoble who was a NCP minister and was an MLA from Mohol constituency in Solapur is being accused of having assets worth hundreds of crores. Interestingly many of the complaints against Dhoble to the ACB have been made by local NCP activists themselves from Solapur it self. The ACB had been waiting for the government go ahead to probe him since last year. In April- 2014 the ACB also put up Dhoble and other Minister’s name on its website against it wanted to proceed but was waiting for government sanction. The names were however later removed from the ACB website. The former Minister was in the news last year after a 42 year old former staffer from one of the educational institutions that he was running filed a case of rape against him. With the Home department clearing the decks for an inquiry against Dhoble, the latter becomes the fifth former Minister from the Congress-NCP government to face an ACB probe. Immediately after the Sena joined the government, Fadnavis had cleared the probe against former Deputy Chief Minister and NCP leader Ajit Pawar amd former Irrigation Minister for their role in the irrigation scam. The Chief Minister has also given the sanction to the ACB to probe former PWD Minister Chaggan Bhujbal in the Maharashtra Sadan scam and on Tuesday the Home department also cleared the decks for the ACB to probe former Congress Co-operation Minister Harshvardhan Patil in a co-operative bank scam. Corruption among the Congress-NCP leaders was one of the main planks on which the BJP came to power and Fadnavis had vowed before the elections that they would initiate action against those Ministers and officials who were involved in graft.","The Maharashtra government, led by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, has approved an Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) investigation into former Maharashtra Water Supply and Sanitation Minister Laxman Dhoble from the Congress-NCP government over alleged disproportionate assets.

The environment ministry is working on a methodology by factoring in the existing norms to issue such logo which will be developed by inviting designs from general public and experts. ""The ministry is contemplating on crowd-sourcing the design after internal discussion and deliberations with all stakeholders,"" said an official. Though several green buildings have come up in different parts of the country in the past few years, they do not carry specific sign which may put them in different league. ""This will not only help people to identify green buildings, but also give a sense of pride for the owners. This will also motivate others to go for green building concept, driving many co-benefits associated with it,"" said the official. At present, buildings get star rating by a government agency - Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) - for energy efficiency and other green ratings by two private bodies. The logo to be issued by the environment ministry for such buildings will factor in all such existing norms. This is part of several other initiatives which are to be taken up by the environment ministry in 2015. Promotion of renewable energy - solar and wind - in a big way is an important component of the government's plan. On law front, the government has decided to bring amendments in all five key environment laws in the budget session of the Parliament. Idea of bringing amendments is to make all the green laws in sync with the Narendra Modi government's development goals. The laws which are to be amended include the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986; the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980; the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972; the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. ""The changes will be made in these laws on the basis of various recommendations of the TSR Subramanian panel which had submitted its report to the ministry in November, 2014,"" said an official.

He said it was a pity that India's former defence minister had such a ""casual view on issues relating to terror"".
It is very disturbing when a senior leader like Sharad Pawar ji makes preposterous statements on India’s stand on a terror attack in Israel. The menace of terrorism has to be condemned in all forms, in any part of the world. It is a pity that a person who has been India’s Defence Minister as well as a Chief Minister many times has such a casual view on issues relating to terror,"" he wrote in a post on Facebook. Pawar, who has been battling an intra-party rebellion spearheaded by his nephew Ajit Pawar, said on Sunday India always supported the cause of Palestine.

Pawar, addressing party workers, had claimed Israel was an outsider that ""encroached"" on Palestine's land. He said former prime ministers -- like Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi and Atal Bihari Vajpayee – had supported the Palestine cause.
It is very unfortunate that for the first time, our Prime Minister stood with Israel,"" he had said.

Goyal today attacked the former UPA government, accusing it of shedding tears on the Batla House encounter.

""Pawar ji was a part of the same government that shed tears on the Batla House encounter and slept while there were terror attacks on Indian soil. This rotten mindset has to stop. I hope Pawar ji at least now, thinks of the nation first,"" Goyal added.

Reacting to attack by Hamas on Israel in which over 1400 people died on October 7, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said he was ""deeply shocked"" by the news.
Deeply shocked by the news of terrorist attacks in Israel. Our thoughts and prayers are with the innocent victims and their families. We stand in solidarity with Israel at this difficult hour,"" he wrote on X on October 8.
Two days later, he reiterated his stance on a phone call with Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu. He expressed his strong and unequivocal condemnation of terrorism.

NCP leader Jayant Patil said Goyal should read the Ministry of External Affairs' statement on Palestine first.

""As far as I know, External Affairs Ministry has made a statement on Palestine too. He should read that first. I think then he will understand what decision is his government making.""

Last week, MEA said India always advocated negotiations towards establishing a state of Palestine.","In the political discourse, a row has broken out between India’s top leaders over India’s stand on the issue of Israel-Hamas. NCP leader Sharad Pawar took issue with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s support for Israel, claiming that India has supported Palestine in the past. Pawar called the Prime Minister’s remarks “disturbing” and said the former defense minister’s comments on terrorism were “too light-hearted.” Union minister Piyush Gupta responded by reminding Pawar about the UPA government’s reaction to the batla house encounter.

The Delhi high court on Tuesday set aside city court's order that had paved way for Rajya Sabha secretariat to evict Aam Aadmi Party MP Raghav Chadha from his official residence in the national capital.
A single bench of Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani revived the city court’s April 18 order of restraining the secretariat from dispossessing the MP from the bungalow till adjudication of his application seeking temporary injunction against eviction.
The court has directed Chadha to approach the city court within three days with his application for interim relief and has directed the trial court to first decide on the same in accordance with law.

“The appeal is allowed. Holding that A) there was no requirement for the appellant to file an application under 80 CPC to comply with that provision thus the application under 80 CPC is disposed of as infructuous. Directing the appellant to be present in the court within three days of the pronouncement of the judgement with the direction to the trial court to first decide the application under Order 39 rule 1 and 2 & thus to proceed in accordance with law. In the meantime, the order dated 18/4 shall stand revived till the application under order 39 rule 1 & 2 is decided by the trial court,” the bench said while pronouncing the verdict.
On October 10, Chadha had moved the Delhi high court against the local court's order to vacate an interim order which had stopped the RS secretariat from evicting him from the official government bungalow allotted to him.

On September 8, 2022, the AAP leader was allotted a Type VII bungalow at Delhi's Pandara Road from the Rajya Sabha pool. He took possession of the bungalow in November 2022.","Raghav Chadha, a member of the Aam Aadmi Party, is now able to stay at his official house in the nation's capital after the Delhi High Court overruled a lower court's ruling.

The Tribune,1998-10-15 00:00:00,Action plan to fight terrorism formulated,"A seven-point action plan, calling for the creation of special task forces to tackle the menace of ISI-sponsored terrorism and criminal gangs and reorientation of the criminal justice system, was formulated at a meeting of the Chief Ministers of seven northern states here today. The meeting, convened by Home Minister L. K. Advani, to discuss the prevailing law and order situation and the need to build coordination among states to tackle terrorism, suggested that old laws be amended to provide effective countering of strategies being adopted by criminals. For this, legal backing was essential, the meeting felt. It decided that special task forces should be set up to evolve and implement a plan of action to identify and stamp out terrorists and criminal gangs and to carry out coordinated operations against inter-state criminals. The meeting strongly favored that the criminal justice system should be reoriented in view of the problems being faced in law enforcement, especially with a view to countering the designs of external agencies. The meeting felt that there had to be speedier disposal of cases and bail should also be given with due care. It also proposed suitable amendments to the Motor Vehicles Act, the Passport Act, and the Explosive Substances Act to make them more stringent. The Union Home Ministry estimated that property worth Rs 2,000 crore was damaged and nearly 34,000 lives were lost in the country on account of terrorism sponsored by the ISI. In a presentation on the role being played by the Pakistani agencies and their surrogates in India to destabilize internal security, it said Rs 46,000 crore was spent on army and security forces on internal security duties. While the period was not mentioned, in the presentation on the magnitude and extent of damage caused by ISI-sponsored terrorism, the ministry quantified that 51,810 kg of high explosives, including RDX had been pushed into India, and 7,125 Pakistanis and foreign mercenaries sent after training for sabotage. Of these, 1,750 were still active, 1,120 had been killed, 140 arrested, and the rest had returned. This figure excluded 19,000 Indians trained by the ISI in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Afghanistan for sabotage. The ministry also estimated that Rs 18,500 crore was spent on compensation to victims, border-fencing, and raising of counter-terrorist forces. Addressing the meeting, the Union Home Minister, Mr. L. K. Advani, stressed the need to handle internal security with a firm hand so that the country was not perceived as a ""soft state."" ""India should not be perceived to be a 'soft state,' although there should be no compromise with the ideals of justice enshrined in the Indian Constitution,"" Mr. Advani said. Mr. Advani urged the states to effectively counter the proxy war of the ISI and suggest new ideas and operational methodology by which the central government and the states could work to improve the existing measures. The meeting was attended by the chief ministers of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, and Rajasthan, and the Finance Minister of Punjab. Taking part in the deliberations, the Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister, Mr. Prem Kumar Dhumal, urged the Centre to liberally help the state to enable it to beef up security in the border areas adjoining Jammu and Kashmir. He also thanked the Centre for agreeing to bear the expenses on the hiring of a helicopter to undertake reconnaissance and intensify vigil in the border areas. Mr. Dhumal also urged the Centre to bear the expenditure on account of the deployment of paramilitary forces on the border areas of Himachal, which the Centre had agreed to in principle, a state government note said. The Haryana Chief Minister, Mr. Bansi Lal, stressed the need to constitute a special task force for the NCR to coordinate the investigation of serious crimes. ""Coordination between the police forces of neighboring states needs to be strengthened, and there is also a need to improve the communication system throughout the NCR,"" he said. Mr. Bansi Lal also demanded Rs 54 crore for the modernization of police in Haryana.","At a meeting of chief ministers from seven northern Indian states, hosted by Home Minister L. K.

The Hindu,2012-02-05 00:00:00,A tragic impasse,"Russia and China may have acted rashly in vetoing a sharply worded draft United Nations Security Council Resolution on Syria but the United States, France and Britain – who have reacted with predictable fury — cannot escape their responsibility for an impasse which leaves the world unable to act on the unfolding humanitarian disaster in that country. The urgency of the situation is obvious; fierce fighting continues in several cities, with civilian deaths in Homs reported at up to 300 over the past few days alone. By U.N. estimates, at least 5,400 people have been killed since the uprisings started in March 2011. India voted for the draft, noting that it expressly rules out intervention in Syria under Article 42 of the U.N. Charter, and supporting the resolution's call for political dialogue between President Bashar al-Assad's government and opposition groups under the auspices of the Arab League. Moscow, however, has been hostile to all drafts on this matter, even the latest which dropped the demand that Mr. Assad step down. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov says the call made for government forces to withdraw to barracks is not balanced by a similar requirement for armed opposition groups and will thereby endanger any political process. The West has only itself to blame for alienating what could have been powerful and influential allies in this terrible and protracted crisis. Russia's unwillingness to go along with a U.S.-led process stems, in large measure, from its anger at western conduct over Libya. The U.N. resolution of March 2011 imposed only a no-fly zone but served, in reality, as a cover for NATO's aim of violent regime change there. Today, Russia and China both believe they were deceived into abstaining rather than using their veto. Though Moscow has sought to distance itself from the brutalities of the Assad regime, which is now using heavy weapons against protesters, Saturday's veto is a shot in the arm for Damascus. But Washington's approach, which has included strident calls for President Assad to go, does not open a path for an urgent political solution to the violence either. One of the problems is that the opposition to the regime is severely fragmented. The Syrian National Council is at odds with both the Free Syrian Army and the National Co-ordination Committee. Furthermore, with the regime in Damascus drawn from the 10 per cent Alawite Shia minority, Sunni extremist groups have jumped into the fray. The P-5 and Arab League, along with India, Brazil and South Africa, must go back to the drawing board and come up with a new plan of action that can end the violence and set the stage for a Syrian-led political solution.","Russia and China vetoed a draft United Nations Security Council Resolution on Syria, but the United States, France, and Britain are responsible for the impasse that leaves the world unable to act on the humanitarian disaster in the country.

The Pioneer,2011-03-31 00:00:00,UlFA chief Barua fights for relevance in election season,"In the season of election campaigning, Assam is witnessing another kind of a showdown — between the Tarun Gogoi-led Congress Government and United Liberation Front of Asom commander-in-chief Paresh Barua. As of now Gogoi seems to be on the back foot, despite the peace initiative taken by Arabinda Rajkhowa, leader of the separatist group’s faction.
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh cancelled his March 28 proposed visit to the State after the Barua-led ULFA group called Assam bandh on the day to protest the Prime Minister’s visit. Barua is a staunch opponent of the ongoing peace talks. Though other reasons have been cited now by Congress leaders Digvijay Singh and Gogoi for the cancellation of the trip, the general public perception here is that the Government, mindful of the support Barua can drum up, decided to avoid embarrassment in poll times. According to the people The Pioneer spoke to, with several of them unwilling to come on record, the ULFA factor would be a key issue in the Assembly elections. Incidentally, it was only recently that Gogoi called the ULFA chief “weak and irrelevant”, after almost the entire senior leadership of the group, including its chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa, deserted the Barua faction and came out in support of the peace process with the Union Government. The election will, therefore, be a litmus test for the elusive commander-in-chief of the organization that has overtly or covertly determined many an electoral fate in the State in the past three decades of its existence. People said the ULFA leader could “go to any extent” to demonstrate his clout during the poll season. In fact, he has already begun the exercise by issuing a threat to the ruling Congress and allegedly recently attacking the State Congress headquarters here in the capital. The Barua faction has also said in a statement that they would impose a bandh whenever the Prime Minister visited Assam in the coming days. In this backdrop, it remains to be seen whether the Prime Minister keeps the date with the State, expected on April 2. Senior security officials here are unwilling to take the threats lightly as they believe Barua has more than nuisance value, despite being sidelined both by the Government and his own organization. ULFA has always played a key role in the formation of Governments at Dispur from the early 90s itself. Since the 1991 election, the fate of both the State Assembly and the Lok Sabha seats from Assam has been determined to a large extent by the positions taken by this banned organization. Even the Gogoi regime is alleged to have come to power — first in 2001 and then again in 2006 — with the support of the banned organization. A political observer said a tactical alliance with ULFA over the past decade helped the Congress handsomely in retaining power. But Gogoi has now discarded Barua, and the two are rivals. One is determined to have a successful election and cock a snook at the ULFA leader, while the other would want to disrupt the process and prove his relevance in the changed scenario. Barua has given a call to overthrow the Congress Government and has asked the people to stay away from Congress meetings and rallies. This has given the Chief Minister a handle to attack his political opponents, by saying that they are hand in glove with the banned outfit’s leader.","Assam election witness showdown between the Congress Government led by Tarun Gogoi and Paresh Barua, the commander-in-chief of the United Liberation Front of Asom(ULFA), has take center stage.

Palestinian officials blamed an Israeli air strike for the huge blast and fireball which engulfed the Al-Ahli al-Arabi hospital, and said it killed as many as 500 people. Israel said the blast was caused by a failed rocket launch by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group, which denied blame.

Speaking alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr. Biden said: “I was deeply saddened and outraged by the explosion of the hospital in Gaza yesterday, and based on what I’ve seen, it appears as though it was done by the other team, not you.”

As rage spread through the region because of the hospital carnage, and with Mr. Biden arrived in Israel and hugged Mr. Nethanyahu. As Mr. Biden left for Israel, Jordan’s Foreign Minister said his country canceled a regional summit scheduled for Wednesday in Amman, where Mr. Biden was to meet with Jordan’s King Abdullah II, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi.

He will now visit only Israel, a White House official said.Before Tuesday’s blast, health authorities in Gaza said at least 3,000 people had died in Israel’s 11-day bombardment that began after a Hamas October 7 rampage on southern Israeli communities in which 1,300 people were killed and around 200 were taken into Gaza as hostages.","Israeli forces shot dead two Palestinian teenagers near Ramallah in the West Bank on Wednesday during widespread protests against Israel’s bombing of the Gaza Strip, Palestinian officials said.

The deaths brought the toll of Palestinians killed in the latest flare-up of Israeli-Palestinian violence to at least 64 in the West Bank, a sharp uptick in fatal clashes with the army and settlers.

Israel is preparing a ground assault in the Gaza Strip in response to a deadly attack by Palestinian militant group Hamas that killed at least 1,400 Israelis, mostly civilians, on Oct. 7.

Israeli forces have carried out their fiercest bombardment of Gaza in response, killing more than 3,000 Palestinians and imposing a total siege on the blockaded enclave that Hamas controls, fuelling anger among Palestinians in the West Bank.",International News

Indian Express,2023-10-18 00:00:00," Outrage over Gaza hospital deaths, protests roil West Asia amid blame game","The Palestinians blamed an Israeli missile strike for the deaths at the Al Ahli Hospital in Gaza City – the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry put the death toll at 471 – while Israel maintained it had nothing to do with the explosion and said a rocket launched by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad had misfired and landed on the hospital.Hours after a deadly explosion at a Gaza hospital was said to have killed hundreds of civilians, Israeli and Palestinian officials traded blame Wednesday as outrage mounted and protests erupted across West Asia, raising the spectre of a wider regional conflict.

The Palestinians blamed an Israeli missile strike for the deaths at the Al Ahli Hospital in Gaza City – the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry put the death toll at 471 – while Israel maintained it had nothing to do with the explosion and said a rocket launched by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad had misfired and landed on the hospital, resulting in casualties.

As charges flew thick and fast and condemnation of the incident poured in from across the world, especially from outraged capitals of the region where protests raged, US President Joe Biden flew into Tel Aviv and met Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to show solidarity with Israel over its war against Hamas. He appeared to have backed Netanyahu on Israel’s claim that the explosion at the hospital was a result of a misfired rocket by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.

(The Associated Press news agency quoted Biden telling Netanyahu: “Based on what I’ve seen, it appears as though it was done by the other team, not you.” But he said there were “a lot of people out there” who weren’t sure what caused the blast. “The entire world was rightfully outraged but this outrage should be directed not at Israel but at the terrorists,” Netanyahu said during a subsequent meeting with Biden and Israel’s war cabinet. Biden had also been scheduled to visit Jordan to meet with Arab leaders Wednesday, but the summit was called off after the hospital explosion. The Reuters news agency said an urgent meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) was taking place in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia.)“Civilian casualties in the ongoing conflict are a matter of serious and continuing concern. Those involved should be held responsible,” he said in a post on X – this was perceived as a message to both Israel and Hamas.

His remarks were in line with the statement earlier by the Ministry of External Affairs whose spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said there was an universal obligation to observe international humanitarian law, and also a global responsibility to fight the menace of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.","Hours after a deadly explosion at a Gaza hospital was said to have killed hundreds of civilians, Israeli and Palestinian officials traded blame Wednesday as outrage mounted and protests erupted across West Asia, raising the spectre of a wider regional conflict.

She made the remark while expressing her views on the apex court’s judgment on the legality of same-sex marriage.

""The Supreme Court has not prevented same-sex persons from staying together. As the country has no such legislation for marriage between same-sex persons, the court did not interfere in it,"" she said.

Chand, who had no hesitation in revealing that she was in a relation with her partner for five years, said they love each other and would get married.""We are optimistic that the Centre and Parliament will certainly consider the case and make a proper legislation for marriage between same-sex persons in future,"" Chand said.

A five-judge constitution bench of the Supreme Court on Tuesday unanimously refused to accord legal recognition to same-sex marriage under the Special Marriage Act, ruling that it is within Parliament's ambit to change the law for validating such union.

The sprinter said the marriage between same-sex should not be seen in terms of urban-rural, upper-lower, caste, creed or religion.

""It is a problem of humanity and all should get proper rights in life,"" she said.

The Statesman,2023-10-18 00:00:00,Promises to keep,"Indian athletes did very well at the recently concluded Asian Games held in Hangzhou, China, and their feat of garnering over 100 medals for the first time in Asia’s premier track and field competition has been justly celebrated across the country.ndian athletes did very well at the recently concluded Asian Games held in Hangzhou, China, and their feat of garnering over 100 medals for the first time in Asia’s premier track and field competition has been justly celebrated across the country.

Indeed, India’s tally of 107 medals 28 gold, 38 silver and 41 bronze was its best ever Asian Games performance. But the country’s aspiration to become a top sporting nation, at least in Asia, is still some way off; there are miles to go for that to come to fruition. Taking the 1982 Asiad hosted in New Delhi as the baseline, for example, tells us that as a proportion of the total medals competed for, the Indian haul in 2023 107 out of 1500 was inferior to our 1982 performance when we won 57 out of a total 679 medals at stake.

Further, the gap between the leading Asian sporting nation, China, and India, is widening.
In 1982, China won 153 medals to India’s 57 (2.7 times more), and in 2023 the PRC won 383 medals to India’s 107 (3.6 times more). The point being made is that as we celebrate the impressive medals tally in the latest iteration of the Asian Games, it is also a moment for some introspection. India’s massive youth population which is projected to reach 365 million by 2030 needs to start training now if we want to make even a small impression on the world and Olympic stage.Way back in 2007, there was an attempt to introduce a sports policy which never materialised. The implementation of the National Sports Development Code (2011), while a good initiative, has been patchily and the results have therefore been suboptimal though it helped societal internalisation of the fact that sports apart from cricket are not merely pastime but can be a means to drive social development, foster inclusion, and create well paid jobs. The current dispensation has, in this context, shown its commitment to putting money where its mouth is the current fiscal year has the highest ever budget for sports in India’s history and the Centre’s Khelo India and ‘TOPS’ (Target Olympic Podium Scheme) programmes have had a role to play in India’s performance at Hangzhou.

Khelo India has made a difference at the grass-roots with 1,000 budding athletes joining it annually. They receive Rs 6.28 lakh each year to cover expenses from training to pocket money. Many of them move up to the advanced training programme as part of the TOPS developmental group. TOPS also supports elite athletes (core group) with funds, gear, exposure to global sporting competitions, the best coaching, and a monthly allowance of Rs 50,000. Athletes in the developmental group get Rs 25,000 per month.

At Hangzhou, 125 Khelo India athletes participated and 36 of them won medals. Now, the welcome integration of sports into the National Education Policy 2020 must be followed by an emphasis on sports in the National Curriculum Framework for School Education 2023 if India wants to truly change the way citizens at large perceive sports.","Khelo India has made a difference at the grass-roots with 1,000 budding athletes joining it annually.

The Shilong Times ,2023-10-18 00:00:00,"Lack of structural damage, craters at Gaza hospital blast site prove it wasn’t airstrike: IDF","Jerusalem, Oct 18: The lack of structural damages and craters at the site of the Gaza hospital which was bombed, proved that the blast was not caused by an airstrike, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Wednesday.
Addressing a press conference, IDF spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said that imagery following the deadly blast on Tuesday at the al-Ahli hospital showed “no cratering and no structural damage to nearby buildings”, reports CNN.

“There are no craters here. The walls stay intact. This shows is it not an aerial munition that hit the parking lot. Analysis of our aerial footage confirms that there was no direct hit of the hospital itself.

“The only location damaged is outside the hospital in the parking lot where we can see signs of burning,” he added.

Hagari’s remarks came shortly after the IDF posted a video on X which included multiple shots showing the deadly Gaza hospital explosion and said that “a failed rocket launch by the Islamic Jihad terrorist organisation hit the Al Ahli hospital in Gaza City”.

At the press conference, Hagari said IDF trajectory analysis confirmed that rockets were fired from close proximity to the hospital, adding that most of the propellant (rocket fuel) was still visible because the trajectory of the rocket was short.

“At 6.59 p.m. (Tuesday evening), a barrage of around 10 rockets was fired by Islamic Jihad from a nearby cemetery. It was at the time, 6:59 p.m. — when there were reports of an explosion at the hospital in Gaza City,” CNN quoted the spokesperson as saying.

He went on to say that the Hamas militant group understood the blast was caused by a misfired Islamic Jihad rocket, but launched a “global media campaign” to blame Israel.

“They went as far as inflating the numbers of casualties. They understood with absolute certainty that it was a rocket misfired by Islamic Jihad that damaged the hospital.

“Unlike Hamas, the IDF launched an immediate examination” of the attack,” he added.

Hagari also said that the IDF had intelligence of “communications between terrorists” discussing rockets misfiring, which included mention of the hospital.

The IDF also released audio of a conversation allegedly between two Hamas operatives in which they spoke of a rocket launch from a cemetery near the hospital, CNN reported.

In the audio, one of the operatives can be heard saying: “They are saying that the shrapnel from the missile is local shrapnel and not like Israeli shrapnel.”

Hagari said it was common for rockets fired at Israel to fall short “and cause casualties”.

“We have counted approximately 450 rockets that have fallen short and fell in Gaza during this war.”

In the spirit of “maximum transparency”, the IDF is sharing its evidence with others, including the US, Hagari added.

The Arunachal Times ,2023-10-18 00:00:00,HRLN writes to VC on alleged discrimination against ST category faculty members at Himalayan University,"ITANAGAR, 17 Oct: The Human Rights Law Network (HRLN) has expressed concerns over alleged discrimination against Scheduled Tribe (ST) faculty members at Himalayan University (HU), located in Jollang near here.

In a letter to the university’s Vice-Chancellor (VC), HRLN stated that it has received numerous complaints of discrimination, such as pay disparities and salary deductions for faculty members belonging to the ST category.

HRLN urged the VC to promptly address these issues to ensure that all faculty members are treated fairly and equally in accordance with the principles of the Constitution and the guidelines set by the ST/SC Prevention of Atrocities Act.HRLN noted a significant disparity in salaries between ST and non-APST (Arunachal Pradesh Scheduled Tribe) faculty members. It observed that non-APST faculty members receive considerably higher salaries than APSTs, even when their educational qualifications are the same, and they join on the same day.

“It has also been reported that certain allowances and emoluments are exclusively provided to non-APST faculty members while being denied to APST faculty members. This practice has raised concerns among APST faculty members, as it appears to be discriminatory and unjust,” the letter stated.

HRLN further pointed out that the salary of APST faculty members is sometimes deducted without proper consideration especially, in cases when a faculty member is delayed in reaching the institute due to inclement weather, unforeseen medical emergencies, or other genuine reasons.

It has also been alleged that non-APST faculty members are exempted from similar deductions, creating a perception of unequal treatment.

“If these complaints are true, they not only violate the principles of fairness and justice but also contravene the ST/SC Prevention of Atrocities Act and the fundamental tenets of our constitution,” the letter said.

“Discrimination based on caste or any other criterion is not acceptable in any educational institution, and it is our shared responsibility to uphold the principles of equality and social justice,” the letter added.","ITANAGAR, 17 Oct: The Human Rights Law Network (HRLN) has expressed concerns over alleged discrimination against Scheduled Tribe (ST) faculty members at Himalayan University (HU), located in Jollang near here.

Energy and green transition have taken centre stage at numerous conclaves since the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015. A rise in world population and disposable income has fuelled demand for energy. Growth in global energy consumption has averaged one percent per year for the last five decades. This led to the adoption of advanced exploration and production (E&P) technology, which facilitated higher output and efficiency. As numerous oil and gas facilities age worldwide, scores of virgin territories have been accessed for exploration. This, despite the increase in initiatives towards reducing inveterate dependence on fossil fuels to ensure a healthier future.","Since the Paris Agreement in 2015, discussions about energy and transitioning to greener alternatives have been a focal point in various meetings and conferences. The world's population has been growing, and people have more money to spend, which has driven up the demand for energy. Over the last five decades, global energy consumption has been steadily increasing at an average rate of about one percent each year. To keep up with this demand, there has been a significant shift towards using advanced exploration and production (E&P) technologies, which help extract energy resources more efficiently.

The Arunachal Times ,2009-07-16 00:00:00,PPP in Arunachal’s Health Sector: Is it Privatization or Value-Addition?,"Path-breaking decisions by the Government of Arunachal Pradesh, in the year 2005, started a new era from January 2006 as sixteen Primary Health Centers (PHCs) were brought under the Public Private Partnership (PPP) project of the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM). Four voluntary organizations were chosen to manage these PHCs, one in every district, which were quite dysfunctional till the end of 2005. NGO-managed PHCs not only provide curative services; but also they focus on preventive medicines and organize different outreach activities. Besides reducing morbidity and mortality in PHC areas, NGOs have been able to empower the community to demand quality healthcare that should match Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS) and here the PHC Management Committees play a vital role. Ignoring the hardships, NGO-staff provide services in a 24 x 7 manner and when there are complicated cases they smartly refer these to large hospitals by using PHC-Ambulance. Decentralized planning, promoting team spirit amongst staff, responsible supervision, timely supply of drugs and pro-poor approach are some of the trade secrets of NGOs' success. However, the credit primarily goes to the community residents of PHC areas because their cooperation, constructive criticisms, and caring attitude towards the staff help achieve the immediate goal, although there are miles to go for ensuring sustainability. NRHM has been effective in the country; however, several PHCs and CHCs of the Government still do not perform well. Therefore, the PPP model of the Government of Arunachal Pradesh has emerged as the best solution in this context. Now, after a 42-month period, sixteen NGO-managed PHCs have not only become functional but also many NRHM-implementing States have started similar initiatives by learning from Arunachal. In fact, the Government of Arunachal Pradesh is planning to hand over the management of a few CHC-cum-FRU to NGOs too which would certainly help improve the quality and quantity of health-service. The name PPP sometimes creates confusion among the common people; however, it's truly Public-Nonprofit-Partnership. Here, NGOs do not make a profit like other PPPs of the infrastructure sector. Moreover, this is not at all privatization of Government Hospitals. If one looks at it objectively, then it's found that PPP in Arunachal's Health Sector is essentially a value addition. Government only handovers the management of its hospitals for a short period, and if any NGO does not provide quality service then the contract can be easily terminated. Moreover, all the assets created under the PPP project belong to the Government of Arunachal Pradesh but not to the NGOs. PHCs and CHCs do not lack resources since NRHM is operational; however, proper utilization of men, money, and materials is still a matter of great concern in some of these institutions. The responsible Government cannot sit idle by seeing the poor utilization of resources, so its decision to hand over the management of PHCs and CHCs to NGOs would always be remembered in the golden history of Public Health. Everyone deserves quality healthcare as it's his or her right, and it hardly matters who the service providers are.","In 2005, the Government of Arunachal Pradesh started a new era by introducing a Public Private Partnership (PPP) project under the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM).

He stated this while paying tribute to the freedom fighters and the then King of Manipur in an annual religious ceremony of offering fruits and flowers to departed souls (last day of tarpon) at Lishang Hiden, place near the memorial complex of Gambhir Singh.
Addressing the media at the sidelines of the function, Joy said that it is unfortunate to see the worsening political trends of Manipur. The present government is a complete failure that is unable to fulfil their promises, he added.
He continued and said that when BJP came into power, they affirmed to take development work within 14 months which Congress-led government could not do in 15 years. However, the deplorable condition of the road from Canchipur to Lilong shows that this government is just good enough in lip service.

Highlighting that the government is directly transferring the funds for all the welfare schemes directly to the beneficiaries without any diversion or dilution, Naidu pointed out the need of opening a bank account by every individual. He also pointed out the need of translating the names of the various welfare schemes in local dialect and to make advertisements in a wide scale to make the local populace become more aware about the schemes.
The basic communication and primary education should also be in mother tongue so that children should be able to think creatively, he added. He also extended his compliment to IBSD for its sterling efforts to sequence the SARS CoV 2 positive samples for not only Manipur state but also for other states of the Northeastern region.
Observing that the Northeastern region is a biodiversity hotspot with its rich variety of ecosystems, Naidu further praised IBSD for managing the bioresources of the region for sustainable development using modern biotechnological tools.

Engaged in turmeric cultivation for nearly three generations, the farmers had never seen so much money from one crop in their lifetime. While the farmers expected a return of around Rs 5,000 per quintal when they sowed the plant last year, the prices touched record highs in the first week of this May.

At its peak, a quintal of ‘finger’ turmericold at Rs 15,800 and certain varieties like ‘Salem finger’ touched Rs 16,676 per quintal in Erode market, the second largest turmeric market in Asia, next to Sangli in Maharashtra. At present, the prices are hovering between Rs 15,300 and Rs 15,400. Around 20 to 40 quintal can be cultivated on one acre depending on the quality of yield. The literally nil carryover stocks due to a low output in 2009, average yield and rising global demand are said to be the reasons for soaring prices.

Flush with money, farmers have enrolled their children for engineering studies and renovated their old houses. “We have almost repaid our debts with just one harvest of turmeric last year. With this year’s harvest, we expect to complete repayment of our debts and start saving for the future,” said a farmer in Kodumudi village in Erode. Kodumudi village is a major turmeric growing belt in the district. Nearly one lakh bags (each bag of 75 kg) of turmeric reaches the Erode market from this village Turmeric is usually sown from May till August and harvested from January.
On an average, the region comprising Erode, Bhavani, Salem, Attur and even Chamarajanagar in Karnataka contributes around 15-20 lakh bags to the country’s annual requirement of 40-45 lakh bags. In 2009, around 12 lakh bags were produced in this region. The crop area decreased in 2009 due to low price realisation in the previous year and also because of difficulty in cultivating the crop. While farmers reduced the acreage to 9,000 hectares in Erode region in 2008-09, they increased it by 15% for the current season

Questions are being raised about why a Coast Guard vessel should have taken an hour to intercept a fishing boat, but some security experts believe the time taken was not extraordinary.

The Economic Times,2015-01-08 00:00:00,"Telangana government weighs options to contain milk prices, seeks legal opinion","HYDERABAD: Weeks after targeting the Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidu founded Heritage Foods with probe into alleged adulteration of milk, the Telangana government is now weighing options to rein in private dairies in a bid to regulating prices. The Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) led government is currently looking into options to invoke provisions of the Essential Commodities Act to contain selling prices of milk and sought legal opinion, said a bureaucrat who did not want to be named. The move assumes significance as most of the private dairy firms selling milk and milk products in the Telangana geography are owned by the entrepreneurs with roots in Andhra Pradesh, including AP chief minister Naidu founded Heritage Foods. While Telangana agriculture minister Pocharam Srinivas Reddy said there was no move so far to regulate milk prices, the bureaucrat quoted above said, “A government order was already issued sometime back constituting district-level committees to control prices of commodities, including milk.” A Srinivas, managing director of AP Dairy Development Corporation Federation that sells milk and milk products under ‘Vijaya’ brand, said the Telangana chief secretary Rajiv Sharma has convened a meeting on January 19 to discuss price control measures. The move by the Telangana government to rein in private dairy sector comes at a time when several global investors were investing in private dairy firms in India, the world’s largest milk producer with nearly a sixth of global milk production. India’s organised dairy sector is currently valued at around $10 billion and is set to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 13-15% till 2019-20, according to a report by Rabobank. D Sunil Reddy, managing director of Dodla Dairy, said, “The dairy sector in India is no longer controlled by the local players and now has many global players having major interests. Any move to regulate the sector will be negative given the large global private investments into the sector.” Minister Srinivas Reddy said the Telangana government was only keen on strengthening the cooperative sector and accordingly decided to pay an incentive of Rs 4 a litre to those farmers supplying milk to the state-owned cooperatives. The move comes weeks after the government’s announcement to strengthen the dairy cooperatives through free power and supply of at least one crore buffaloes to farmers, apart from setting up a mega dairy involving Rs 240 crore of investment. In a bid to stay competitive, the private dairy players have also increased procurement prices over the last few weeks, matching the prices of cooperatives at the farm level. “Though the government-backed milk cooperatives have the advantage in terms of incentive support from the state government in milk procurement, the retail vendors still prefer selling milk of private dairies owing to attractive commissions being offered by the latter given their efficiencies and cost advantages,” said a top executive of a private dairy. While Heritage Foods management could not be accessed for its comments on Telangana government’s move to rein in private sector, a chief executive of private dairy with MNC investments said, “We have to wait and see if such a move will stand the scrutiny of law and whether the state government-backed cooperatives can address the demand of entire Telangana state if private firms are crippled. Milk was a monopoly of cooperative sector in India till the government initiated economic reforms in 1990 and encouraged private sector investments including global investors. Any reverse regulatory move that could affect the interests of private investors now will send wrong signals to the global investor community.” Hyderabad currently has a demand of some 25 lakh litres a day of fresh milk, which cannot be solely met by the statebacked milk cooperatives at a time when the processing capacities, cold storages and distribution systems are largely controlled by the private players, he said. While the state-backed milk cooperatives control some 25% of the market in Telangana, the private dairies cater to the balance market with Heritage Foods enjoying little over 10% of market share. Referring to the higher support prices to milk farmers being offered by the Telangana government, a senior executive of another private dairy said, “As such Telangana does not produce the quantum of milk to meet the demand. If needed, the private players can procure milk from neighbouring states at lower prices and sell them in Telangana at higher prices to benefit.”","The Telangana government is considering invoking provisions of the Essential Commodities Act to regulate milk prices, targeting private dairies. This move is significant as many private dairy firms in the region have connections to entrepreneurs from Andhra Pradesh, including the Heritage Foods company founded by Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu. Private dairy players have raised procurement prices recently to match those of cooperatives at the farm level, and they argue that any regulation could negatively impact the sector, given significant global investments. The move has raised concerns about affecting the interests of private investors and sending the wrong signals to the global investor community.",Politics

The Economic Times,2015-01-08 00:00:00,Pune youths’ anti-poaching device promises to help save tigers,"PUNE: Two engineers, a biology student and a product designer have teamed up to make a collar device that will help tigers protect themselves from metal traps, electrocution and poisoning — the three most widely used means of poaching. The ‘Independent Anti-Poaching Device (IAPD)’ is a sensor-based device to be fitted around the tiger’s neck. The device is waiting a certificate of clearance from the Wildlife Institute of India. The group, meanwhile, has got permission from the chief conservator of forests to study tiger conditions in the Melghat tiger reserve in Amravati. Pulse emission and optical sensors used in the collar are designed specific to the types of snares locally made in Indian villages. The snares include 220V-11kV current used for electrocution and an undetectable pesticide called ‘Carbofuran’ used to poison tigers. The device will alert the tiger about the presence of any of the three threats through a specific frequency to which the tiger is sensitive. There is no need for interference or supervision by humans. This frequency will be used by the IAPD to communicate the presence of imminent danger to the tiger. The frequency will also help communicate the direction of the danger so that the tiger does not run into a trap. The device has been designed in a way that it does not hamper the natural processes of the animal or cause any physical or mental discomfort such as problems during mating or mental stress. The IAPD uses a higher and lighter form of silicon rubber camouflaged as the tiger’s coat itself so that the presence of any foreign object on the cat’s body is not obvious. The concept and team was put together over a period of eight months by Shantanu Naidu, a mechanical engineer working with a private sector firm. The four-member team includes Mrinmayi Dalvi, a final year student of Fergusson College who researched the tiger’s biology, Varun Natu from NBN Sinhgad School of Engineering, who researched materials and composites and Anay Kshirsagar of the Symbiosis Institute of Design, who worked on the product design. Manoj Badave, plant head at a private engineering firm, provided the necessary direction. Shantanu Naidu (22), an animal lover and the brain behind the idea, is confident that the IAPD will serve its purpose. “The forest officials identified several practical problems during our discussions with them. We have addressed them in the design stage itself. We tried to make the IAPD as fail-safe as possible. Unlike previously used radio collars, ours does not require any human interference and is extremely light. In case a tiger is poisoned with carbofuran, the collar will transmit a signal and using the embedded GPS, forest officials would be able to locate the tiger and save it by administering an antidote,” Naidu said. Chief conservator of forests (wildlife) Sunil Limaye said, “The device is technically sound, but we are not sure how practical it is to be used as a collar. I have advised the group to have the technology weighted by the Wildlife Institute of India. Meanwhile, they can study tiger conditions in Melghat.”  The group hopes to implement the design on other cat species, like the leopard, in the near future.","A team of engineers and students has developed an ""Independent Anti-Poaching Device (IAPD)"" to protect tigers from poaching threats like metal traps, electrocution, and poisoning. The collar device, awaiting clearance from the Wildlife Institute of India, uses sensors and specific frequencies to alert tigers of imminent dangers without human intervention, allowing for immediate rescue. The lightweight, camouflaged design aims to minimize disruption to the tigers' natural behavior. The team is conducting studies in the Melghat tiger reserve and hopes to adapt the technology for other big cat species in the future.

The United Arab Emirates supported the November decision by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to maintain production. The National reported Mazrouei as saying. Brent crude, a pricing benchmark for more than half of the world’s oil, tumbled 48% last year, the most since 2008. Opec decided on November 27 to maintain production instead of cutting output to eliminate a surplus left by increased supplies from the US to Russia. “Depending on the actual production growth from non-Opec countries, this problem could take months or even years,” the UAE’s Mazrouei was quoted as saying in The National, referring to oversupply. “If they act rationally, we can see positive corrections during 2015.” Saudi Arabia won’t cut its output, though producers outside the group are welcome to do so, Ali Al-Naimi, that country’s oil minister, said at a conference in Abu Dhabi on December 21. Opec would find it “difficult, if not impossible” to give up part of its share in global oil markets by cutting output, he said on December 19. Mazrouei said Opec didn’t contribute to putting too much crude up for sale “and shall not be blamed if other non-Opec countries oversupply the market,” according to The National. UAE oil output averaged 2.77 million barrels a day last year, down from 2.92 million barrels daily in August 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Saudi oil production at 9.5 million barrels a day is near a three-decade high of 10 million barrels daily reached in September. Opec production at 30.2 million barrels a day in December exceeded the group’s own 30 million barrel a day target for a seventh consecutive month, according to the data compiled by Bloomberg. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have boosted output this decade to compensate for losses in Opec production from countries such as Libya and Iran.","According to the UAE energy minister, Suhail Al Mazrouei, the oversupply of crude oil in the market may take several months or even years to be resolved, depending on when non-OPEC producers reduce their output. OPEC's decision in November to maintain production levels rather than cut them has led to an oversupply issue, with the UAE expressing support for this decision. The minister suggested that the problem could be resolved more quickly if non-OPEC countries act rationally and reduce their production.

The Economic Times,2015-01-08 00:00:00,Mahinda Rajapaksa’s astrologer Abeygunawardena faces the ultimate test,"GALLE: Few people will be watching this week’s presidential election in Sri Lanka with more pointed interest than a balding, prosperouslooking man wearing a gold amulet under his shirt, who claims the title of “royal astrologer.” For decades, the astrologer, Sumanadasa Abeygunawardena, has stood beside the longtime politician and current president, Mahinda Rajapaksa, occupying a role that, in this part of the world, combines the functions of spiritual adviser, political consultant and life coach. These days, Abeygunawardena’s main work is identifying auspicious timing for the president’s political acts —“10:48 am was a strong time, the bird becomes king,” was one recent recommendation. But he also weighs in on such details as whether to submit nomination papers to the election commissioner’s right or left side and performs rituals in an ornate shrine in his attic, which is bracketed by six curving elephant tusks. Many of Rajapaksa’s advisers must be on tenterhooks this week as he heads into one of the biggest gambles of his political career. When the president opted to hold elections this January, two years ahead of schedule, he could not have anticipated the challenge that has leapt up before him: Maithripala Sirisena, the former health minister and general secretary of Rajapaksa’s own party, mounted a surprise challenge, accusing the president of turning Sri Lanka into a “soft dictatorship” led by his sprawling extended family. His defection, along with those of other longtime presidential aides, has turned the re-election campaign into a white-knuckle affair. Abeygunawardena has publicly maintained that the day of the vote, Thursday, will be an “immensely fortunate” date for the president, though he says he had no role in selecting the date. Identifying auspicious times, he said, is “very dangerous work, very risky work,” and, for astrologers working at his level, potentially career-ending. “Even if there is a slight defect, it can result in something bad,” he said. If an astrologer errs, “the whole thing goes wrong,” he said, noting, “Sometimes their houses are demolished.” “I have never received any admonitions,” he hastened to add, “because I have never given any wrong advice.” Rajapaksa is certainly not the first Sri Lankan leader to engage the services of an astrologer. Most of his opponents do, too, and some stories floating around Colombo about past spiritual practices make his sound relatively temperate. A highranking minister in the former United National Front government was said to have climbed into a burlap sack full of spices in an effort to ward off the evil eye. And a previous president, Ranasinghe Premadasa, for a time altered the spelling of the country’s name to Shri Lanka because he had been advised it was more auspicious.Rajapaksa, who was first elected in 2005, has shown a rapt interest in what astrologers are saying about him. In 2009, an astrologer named Chandrasiri Bandara was arrested and questioned by the Criminal Investigations Department after he predicted that Rajapaksa might be ousted. Bandara was released shortly afterward, and he continues to comment on politics, but with considerably more caution. Abeygunawardena’s office is decorated with life-size photographs of himself with the president and a giant framed copy of his own Wikipedia entry. One celebrity pictured is Sirisena, who denounced the president in November and is running against him. Asked about the defection, Abeygunawardena gave a small grimace of regret: He said he was close with Sirisena until he mysteriously stopped visiting a few months ago. “I didn’t expect it and didn’t predict it,” he said of the defection, adding that Sirisena’s horoscope is not strong. “The planet Saturn is in his house, and it’s a bad time for him. A very bad time,” he said. “His house is clearly spoiled irreparably.” Abeygunawardena forged his relationship with Rajapaksa in the 1980s, when he approached the politician with a prophecy. Abeygunawardena told him he was the long-awaited Prince Diyasena, the hero who, according to Sinhala Buddhist legend, was destined to save Sri Lanka from anarchy and then rule for around 24 years. These days, he said, he and the president speak almost daily, usually between 5 and 7 am, “even if he is at the gym, or doing Yoga.” “The president, he has such auspicious time and so much power in his planetary position that he cannot be defeated in an election,” he said confidently. “If he gives someone else the position, or steps down, or retires, that’s the only way.” As he left the interview, he fished out his amulet. “One request,” he said. “Don’t put in any words that are against the Rajapaksas.”","A royal astrologer, Sumanadasa Abeygunawardena, plays a crucial role as a spiritual advisor and political consultant to Sri Lanka's President, Mahinda Rajapaksa. Abeygunawardena provides auspicious timings for the president's political actions, and his role is a blend of spiritual guidance and political consultancy. His advice includes details like which side to submit nomination papers. The astrologer believes that the date of the presidential election will be highly fortunate for the president, although he disclaims any involvement in selecting the date, and warns that astrological work can be risky, with severe consequences for mistakes.",International News
Business Today,2011-05-07 00:00:00,Air India pilots call off strike; normal operations in 2 days,"Air India pilots on Friday night called off their 10-day-old strike that resulted in an estimated loss of over Rs 150 crore after Government agreed to reinstate sacked and suspended pilots and look into their demands within a time-frame.

Air India operations will commence from Friday night and is expected to be normalised over the next two days, an airline official said.

Over 800 pilots, belonging to the erstwhile Indian Airlines and owing allegiance to the Indian Commercial Pilots Association, as also the executive pilots, will return to work, Capt A S Bhinder, the association president told reporters after five hours of tough negotiations with the Civil Aviation ministry officials.

Expressing happiness over the pilots ending their stir, Civil Aviation Minister Vayalar Ravi said, ""Their is no ill feeling and there will be no feeling of vengeance"".

Asked about the demands of the pilots, he said, ""interests of all sections of employees will be taken care of by the Dharmadhikari Committee. We have received representations from other sections of employees also and asked them to approach the Committee"".

It would submit its report in about four months, he said.

The three-member Justice Dharmadhikari Committee, set up to go into all merger related HR issues facing Air India employees, has started its work and has already met a cross-section of employees to elicit their views.

Bhinder, along with ICPA general secretary Rishabh Kapur, said ""we have called off the strike as the government has assured us that all the pilots sacked and suspended during the stir would be reinstated and ICPA's recognition restored"".

Both the leaders, who signed the minutes of an understanding reached with the Civil Aviation Ministry, said the government also assured them that it would look into their demand for probing the ""irregularities that have taken place in the airline"".

A major sticking point was the pilots' demand for compensation of 75 'fixed flying hours allowance', which their erstwhile Air India colleagues get.

""All these demands would be considered by the Dharmadhikari committee"", Kapur said, adding that this panel would submit its report in the next few months and government ""told us that an implementation report will be filed by November this year"".

An airline official said normalcy in flight operations would be restored over the ""next two days"" because the airline had stopped taking any bookings for over a week on most of its flights. This had led to the cancellation of about 90 per cent of its flights, with around 60 of its aircraft being grounded.

""If we don't have bookings, it is not wise to fly an empty aircraft. We will now open bookings and start rostering the pilots and other crew members. The process will take at least two days to normalise"", the officials said.

The striking pilots have been demanding that all sackings, suspensions and transfers effected during the strike period be revoked, ICPA's recognition be restored, the contempt of court petition filed by Air India management be withdrawn, a CBI probe into the alleged corruption and mismanagement be ordered and all other issues be tackled in a time-bound manner.

Asked about their demand for removal of AI CMD Arvind Jadhav, Bhinder said, ""our answer to this is that Government has agreed to look into all the irregularities"".

The strike by over 800 pilots owing allegiance to the Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA) had resulted in the grounding of up to 90 per cent of the airline operations.

Air India had sacked seven pilots and suspended six and the management.

The Delhi High Court had slapped contempt notices on nine office bearers of the de-recognised ICPA for disobeying its order to call off the strike.

A Civil Aviation Ministry official said the operational loss suffered by the airline due to the strike was estimated to be over Rs 150 crore.","Air India cancelled their long strike of 10 days as the Government agreed to reinstate sacked and suspended pilots and look into their demands within a time frame. The strike caused a loss of Rs 150 Crore as estimated by a Civil Aviation Ministry Official. There were more than 800 pilots took part in the strike.

The Economic Times,2015-01-08 00:00:00,"Centre, RBI nudge India Inc to dip into bond markets for capital","NEW DELHI: The government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are evaluating a proposal that seeks to nudge large borrowers into meeting working capital requirements from the debt market and not from banks as they do so now. The aim is to release bank funds for lower-rated companies besides further deepening the corporate bond market. The key element of the proposal is that companies with a working capital limit of Rs 100 crore or more should finance the core component of this through the bond market. “Large corporates are best suited to access the corporate bond market for their credit needs,” said a senior government official who was part of deliberations on the plan. RBI is expected to hold discussions with the Indian Banks Association (IBA) over the issue as part of its strategy for “alternative approaches to working capital financing for corporates.” The central bank is also expected to issue a discussion paper on the issue. “We are also in talks with the market regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), which is primarily in favour of releasing bank funds for lower-rated companies,” the official added. According to a senior IBA functionary, some banks had raised questions on the proposal, which was discussed at a recent meeting. “Sharing of securities and collateral between bond holders and working capital providers would be a challenge in view of drawing power related issues,” he said. The government, however, is of view that banks are often required to resort to expensive emergency funding to meet prudential obligations, posing serious liquidity problems. “Such an arrangement (as per the proposal) will have a dual advantage. First, it will help banks manage their funds effectively and second it will help in the development of the nascent bond market,” said the official cited above. Last year, RBI allowed banks to issue bonds with a minimum maturity of seven years to raise resources for lending to long-term projects in infrastructure sub-sectors and affordable housing. IBA has also suggested a model in which around 50% of working capital limit sanctioned to large borrowers can be met through a combination of a bill discounting limit and a working capital demand loan limit (WCDL) limit. “We are in consultations and RBI will soon come up with a structured discussion paper before finalising any terms,” the official added. Experts said the depth of the debt capital market has improved significantly in the last 10 years and that such an initiative would help enhance it. “Both RBI and the government want to de-risk the concentration risk of large banks to large borrowers,” said KPMG (India) partner Harshvardhan Bisht. In order to implement the recommendations, RBI and the government will have to help simplify procedures for taking charge of securities and collateral, so that the end borrower - the bank or bond market - have a secured asset in the event of any defaults, he said.","The Indian government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are considering a proposal to encourage large borrowers to meet their working capital needs from the debt market rather than banks.

The Economic Times,2015-01-08 00:00:00,Pollution to be blamed for cold wave in North India,"NEW DELHI: One big reason for the long spell of extreme cold weather in Delhi and many parts of North India this winter season — affecting road, rail and air traffic almost every day and claiming tens of lives — is rising air pollution, say scientists. Delhi’s air quality, which was adjudged to be the worst among world cities by the WHO in May, worsened as winter approached because of smog and fog, caused by vehicular and factory emissions staying close to the ground in heavy cold air. And fog impacts day temperature by blocking sunshine. “The fog keeps the day-time temperatures low, making it colder,” said climate scientist Ajit Tyagi, who holds the Koteswaram chair in the ministry of earth sciences. Since mid-December, Delhi and north India have been experiencing unusually cold weather even though there has been no appreciable dip in the minimum temperature. This is not unusual for Delhi. A 2007 paper by RK Jenamani of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), analysing hourly fog and temperature data for December and January at the IGI Airport and Safdarjung Airport for the period between 1960 and 2005, established a link between pollution and lower winter temperatures. The paper titled ‘Alarming Rise in Fog and Pollution Causing a Fall in Maximum Temperature over Delhi’ established that pollutants as like particulate matter and aerosol act as additional sources of cloud condensation nuclei necessary for fog formation, which lead to lowering of maximum day time temperatures. Global warming and melting Arctic ice caps were causing the jet stream to become more extreme, leading to the transplanting of unusually cold weather into the midlatitudes. Matters were aggravated in Delhi and north India by unusually high levels of particulate matter in the air, which led to persistent foggy conditions. The situation has only worsened. In November, the Delhi Pollution Control Committee found that levels of particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air, as per data from the six stations that it monitors, remained on an average at least three to four times the 24-hour standard of 60 micrograms per cubic metre. DS Pai of IMD’s National Climate Centre said fog on account of pollution and moisture in air has aggravated the current cold spell by limiting sunshine. Experts said in cold air pollutants accumulate in the atmosphere, especially in the absence of wind, pushing up air pollution levels. In part this is explained by the increase in the quantity of wood and other substances being burnt for heating, especially by the poor, homeless and those doing outdoor duty. Experts said clear skies for a couple of days after the rains last weekend vindicated this point, explaining that the rains and winds helped wash out the build-up of pollutants and fog. A recent multi-institution study has found that Delhi’s air has higher concentrations of harmful components such as lead, zinc and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in winter season. The study by University of Birmingham, the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, the Central Road Research Institute, and the Desert Research Institute, US, was based on data collected between December 2013 and January 2014 from an area adjacent to a heavy traffic site on Mathura Road, an area influenced by industrial emissions in Delhi.","Scientists attribute the extended period of extreme cold weather in Delhi and northern India to rising air pollution. Pollution, exacerbated by smog and fog caused by vehicular and factory emissions staying close to the ground in cold air, affects visibility and temperature. Unusually high levels of particulate matter in the air, especially in stagnant, cold air, contribute to the persistent foggy conditions, making it colder and impacting daily life. This environmental issue is further compounded by the burning of wood and other substances for heating during the winter season.",Politics
The Economic Times,2015-01-08 00:00:00,"Coal scam: JSPL connived with Coal Ministry officials for excess mining, CBI alleges","NEW DELHI: The Coal Ministry officials had ""connived"" with the JSPL, headed by former Congress MP Naveen Jindal, allowing it to ""illegally"" mine nearly three times more coal than permitted, claims a CBI probe into coal block allocation scam. The agency, which has incorporated these details in the FIR in the case, has alleged that the Ministry officials in connivance with the company not only overlooked the excess mining but also regularised it. The case relates to the ongoing probe of the CBI into the coal scam in which it had registered an FIR against the company alleging that instead of adhering to the rate of extraction of coal as provided in the approved Mine Plan, the company had resorted to ""illegal excess mining"". In the FIR, which has now been accessed, the agency has alleged that according to data available ""on record"" while the approved coal production during 1998-99 to 2002-03 was 1.35 MT, the actual coal production by the Company was 5.9 MT which is an excess of 4.55 MT (nearly 300 per cent above the sanctioned extraction) of coal mined ""irregularly"". Defending its position, JSPL spokesperson claimed that the production schedules mentioned for the first five years in the Mine Plans were based on the guidelines mentioned under MCR 1960 Rule 22 (5) wherein the RQP (Registered Qualified Person) who prepares the mine plan gives a tentative scheme of mining and annual plan for excavation from year to year for five years. The spokesperson said it may, therefore, be noted that as per the approved capacity of two million tonnes per annum production for the first five years was below the cumulative year wise capacity of 10 MT and hence there was no excess mining as alleged. The agency has alleged that there was excess coal mining in all the five years against the rate approved in Mine Plan and no prior permission was obtained from the Coal Ministry. The excess mining came ""on record"" during presentation made by the Company before Standing Committee of Coal Ministry for revised Mine Plan in 2004 but the Ministry ""did not take any action"" against the company, the CBI alleged. The role of RQP has also come under the scanner of the CBI which has alleged that the RQP who prepared the irregular mine plan was suspended by the Coal Ministry after irregular mining lease came to the notice of the Ministry but no action was taken against the company. ""Interestingly, though he was suspended the same RQP was again instrumental in preparation of revised mine plan of 2008,"" the agency alleged. According to the CBI, the company continued ""unauthorised"" excess extraction of coal in the years 2003-04 and 2004-05 (ruled by NDA and UPA governments respectively) without the approval of Coal Ministry. The agency has alleged that excess coal mined during 2003-04 and 2004-05 was 1.431 MT over and above 4.55 MT excess coal mentioned above. It is alleged that while Standing Committee in May 2004 has stated that to increase the production to meet coal requirement for a plant the company needs the approval of the screening committee but another Standing Committee held on March 21, 2005 approved the increase in production from two MTPA to five MTPA for a period of three years. The JSPL spokesperson said even for the first six years the coal production remained with in 12 MT (11.29) though there were ""slight deviations"" in the year 2003-04 and 2004-05 beyond the annual approved capacity. ""These deviations were duly brought to the knowledge of Ministry of Coal, Government of India in the draft revised Mine Plan and the same was duly approved by the ministry Chhattisgarh Environment Conservation Board (CECB) issued the consent to operate which also duly regularised such minor deviation. ""Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Rairgarh had also found no irregularity in such minor deviations (in a case filed by CECB) which had been duly regularised by the Government of India and the State Government,"" the spokesperson said. The ""regularisation"" claimed by JSPL has also come under the scrutiny of the agency which alleged that the company ""resorted to misappropriation of coal through excess mining and got the excess coal mined regularised in alleged connivance with officials of Ministry of Coal.""","A CBI probe into a coal block allocation scam in India alleges that officials from the Coal Ministry collaborated with JSPL, a company led by former Congress MP Naveen Jindal, allowing it to engage in ""illegal"" coal mining nearly three times more than permitted. The agency claims the Ministry officials overlooked and regularized the excess mining. JSPL has defended itself, stating that the production was within approved limits. The CBI investigation also brings into question the role of the Registered Qualified Person (RQP) who prepared the irregular mine plan and was later suspended but allowed to work on a revised mine plan in 2008.",Business and Finance

Indian Express,2011-05-07 00:00:00,Air India pilots call off 10-day-old strike,"Air India pilots on Friday night called off their 10-day-old strike after the government agreed to reinstate sacked and suspended pilots, restore recognition to their union and look into their complaints of irregularities.

Over 800 pilots, belonging to the erstwhile Indian Airlines and owing allegiance to the Indian Commercial Pilots Association, as also executive pilots, will return to work tonight (Friday night), Capt A.S. Bhinder, the association president told reporters here.

Emerging after five hours of tough negotiations with the Civil Aviation ministry officials, Bhinder along with ICPA general secretary Rishabh Kapur said all the pilots sacked and suspended during the stir would be reinstated.

ICPA, which was derecognised soon after the agitation started, will be recognised again, they said.

""Government has given us assurances that they will look into all our demands including our complaints of irregularities against the airline management,"" Bhinder said.

One of the major sticking points was the demand of the pilots for compensation of 75 'fixed flying hours allowance', which their erstwhile Air India colleagues get.

The striking pilots have been demanding that all sackings, suspensions and transfers effected during the strike period be revoked, ICPA's recognition be restored, the contempt of court petition filed by Air India management be withdrawn, a CBI probe into the alleged corruption and mismanagement be ordered and all other issues be tackled in a time-bound manner.

Asked about their demand for removal of AI CMD Arvind Jadhav, Bhinder said, ""our answer to this is that government has agreed to look into all the irregularities"".

Civil Aviation Minister Vayalar Ravi expressed happiness over the pilots ending their stir. ""There is no ill feeling and there will be no feeling of vengeance,"" he said.

Asked about the fate of the contempt notices in the Delhi High Court, he noted that the court has fixed the next date of hearing for May 25.

The minister said he was thankful to the pilots for ""agreeing to our suggestions and withdrawing the strike"".

Asked about the demands of the striking pilots, he said, ""interests of all sections of employees will be taken care of by the Dharmadhikari Committee"".

""We have received representations from other sections of employees also and asked them to approach the Committee, he said.

The three-member committee will give its report in the next few months, Ravi said after the two sides reached an understanding.

The strike by over 800 pilots owing allegiance to the Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA) had resulted in the grounding of up to 90 per cent of the airline operations.

Economic Times,2015-06-22 00:00:00,India slips to 61st place on Swiss money list; Pakistan at 73rd,"ZURICH: India has moved down to 61st place in terms of foreigners' money in Swiss banks and it now accounts for a meagre 0.123 per cent of the total global wealth worth USD 1.6 trillion in Switzerland's banking system.

While the UK and the US have retained their top two positions with the largest shares of the foreign clients' money with Swiss banks, Pakistan has inched up to 73rd place.

Interestingly, just two big banks -- UBS and Credit Suisse -- account for nearly two-third of the total money kept by foreigners in Swiss banks, while their share in case of Indians is even higher at about 82 per cent.

As per the latest data released by Switzerland's central banking authority SNB (Swiss National Bank), Indians' money in Swiss banks declined by over 10 per cent to about 1.8 billion Swiss francs (USD 1.98 billion or Rs 12,615 crore) in 2014.

This accounts for just 0.123 per cent of the total funds kept in the Swiss banks by people from across the world.

This is the second lowest level of Indian money in Swiss banks -- after an increase of over 40 per cent in 2013 -- and the latest data comes amid an enhanced clampdown against the famed secrecy wall of Switzerland's banking system.

The funds, described by SNB as 'liabilities' of Swiss banks or ""amounts due to the customers of banks in Switzerland"" are official Swiss figures and do not indicate to the quantum of the much-debated alleged black money held by Indians in the safe havens of Switzerland.

Besides, SNB's official figures do not include the money that Indians or others might have in Swiss banks in the names of entities from different countries.

An analysis of the latest SNB data also showed that the big banks accounted for 1.48 billion Swiss francs of Indians' money, up from 1.36 billion Swiss francs a year ago.

At the end of 2014, there were 275 banks in Switzerland, but only two -- UBS and Credit Suisse -- were classified as 'big banks' by Zurich-based SNB at that time. There are also many foreign-controlled banks operating in the country.

The two big banks' share also rose in the case of the UK, the US and a number of other countries.

Their share almost doubled in case of Pakistan to 472 million Swiss francs, but still accounted for just 36 per cent of the total amount of 1.3 billion Swiss franc held in all Swiss banks by their clients from that country (up from just about one billion Swiss franc a year ago).

This pushed Pakistan one place higher to 73rd place on the overall list of the countries in terms of foreigners' money in Swiss banks. India has come down three places.

In the top-ten, the UK and the US are followed by West Indies, Guernsey, Germany, Bahamas, Luxembourg, France, Jersey and Hong Kong.

The UK alone accounts for 22 per cent of total global funds in Swiss banks. Just four top nations together account for over half of all foreigners' wealth in Swiss banks, which rose to 1.47 trillion Swiss franc (about Rs 102 lakh crore or USD 1.6 trillion) in 2014.","India's rank moved down to 61st place in terms of foreigners' money in Swiss banks.

The funds, described by SNB as 'liabilities' of Swiss banks or amounts due to the customers of banks in Switzerland are official Swiss figures and do not indicate to the quantum of the much-debated alleged black money held by Indians in the safe havens of Switzerland. Besides, SNB's official figures do not include the money that Indians or others might have in Swiss banks in the names of entities from different countries.

An analysis of the latest SNB data also showed that the big banks accounted for 1.48 billion Swiss francs of Indians' money, up from 1.36 billion Swiss francs a year ago. At the end of 2014, there were 275 banks in Switzerland, but only two - UBS and Credit Suisse - were classified as 'big banks' by Zurich-based SNB at that time. There are also many foreign-controlled banks operating in the country. The two big banks' share also rose in the case of the UK, the US and a number of other countries. Their share almost doubled in case of Pakistan to 472 million Swiss francs, but still accounted for just 36 per cent of the total amount of 1.3 billion Swiss franc held in all Swiss banks by their clients from that country (up from just about one billion Swiss franc a year ago).

This pushed Pakistan one place higher to 73rd place on the overall list of the countries in terms of foreigners' money in Swiss banks. India has come down three places. In the top-ten, the UK and the US are followed by West Indies, Guernsey, Germany, Bahamas, Luxembourg, France, Jersey and Hong Kong. The UK alone accounts for 22 per cent of total global funds in Swiss banks. Just four top nations together account for over half of all foreigners' wealth in Swiss banks, which rose to 1.47 trillion Swiss franc (about Rs 102 lakh crore or $1.6 trillion) in 2014.

There are only 19 countries with share of over 1 per cent each and they together command more than 80 per cent of funds. The remaining 20 per cent is divided among close to 200 other countries. China (up at 26th place with 8.2 billion Swiss franc) has a share of 0.55 per cent, while Pakistan has 0.09 per cent.

A number of perceived tax-havens rank higher than India in terms of money in Swiss banks, while others placed above India include Singapore, Italy, Japan, Australia, Russia, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Israel and Cyprus.

More than half of the total funds comes from the developed countries (854 billion Swiss franc), while the offshore centres account for 415 billion Swiss franc and all the developing countries put together 207 billion Swiss franc. Europe accounts for about 900 billion Swiss franc, while Asia Pacific's share is close to 500 billion Swiss franc. As per the latest data, the total Indian money held in Swiss banks at the end of 2014 included 1,776 million Swiss franc or Rs 12,350 crore held directly by Indian individuals and entities (down from 1,952 million a year ago), and another 38 million Swiss franc (down from 77.3 million Swiss francs at 2013-end) through 'fiduciaries' or wealth managers.

However, amounts due to customers' savings and deposit accounts was only CHF 52 million (down from CHF 63 million a year ago), while over CHF 100 million was due through other banks and the remaining amount of well over one billion Swiss francs have been classified as other amounts due to the customers from India. As per the latest data, the amount held by Indians through fiduciaries has reached a record low level, while it used to be in billions till about seven years ago.

The latest data from Zurich-based SNB comes at a time when Switzerland has begun sharing foreign client details on submission of evidence of wrongdoing provided by India and some other countries. It has been facing growing pressure from India and many other countries to share foreign client details, although its own lawmakers were resisting such measures for a long time.

According to the SNB data, funds held by the US entities in Swiss banks rose for the second consecutive year and stood at 244 billion Swiss franc at the end of 2014, despite a major crackdown by the American authorities against the Swiss banks. The countries ranked below India include Qatar, Oman, Iran, Mauritius, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Nepal, Bangladesh, Vatican, Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Myanmar and Bhutan. Greece, Lebanon, Argentina, Turkey, Canada, Mexico, Austria, Brazil, Ireland, Venezuela, Indonesia, Kuwait, Sweden, Egypt, Malaysia, Jordan, Thailand, South Africa, South Korea, Philippines and New Zealand are above India.","India now accounts for a meagre 0.123 per cent of the total global wealth worth $1.6 trillion in Switzerland's banking system.

UBS and Credit Suisse, two banks, account for two-thirds of the total money kept by foreigners in the Swiss banking system and this is 82 per cent higher than Indians.

Indians' money in Swiss banks declined by more than 10% to about 1.8 bn Swiss francs $1.98 bn (Rs 12,615 crore) in 2014, as per a PTI report.
The country now accounts for only 0.123% of the total global wealth worth $1.6 trillion in Switzerland's banking system, as per the data released by Swiss National Bank (SNB).
This is the second lowest level of Indian money in Swiss banks -- after an increase of more than 40% in 2013 -- and the latest data comes amid an enhanced clampdown against the famed secrecy wall of Switzerland's banking system.
Meanwhile, the UK and the US have retained their top two slots with the largest shares of the foreign clients' money in Swiss banks. Pakistan has inched up to 73rd place.
Interestingly, only two big banks -- UBS and Credit Suisse -- account for nearly two-third of the total money kept by foreigners in Swiss banks, while their share in case of Indians is even higher at about 82%.
The funds, described by SNB as 'liabilities' of Swiss banks or ""amounts due to the customers of banks in Switzerland"" are official Swiss figures and do not indicate to the quantum of the much-debated alleged black money held by Indians in the safe havens of Switzerland.

Economic Times,2018-10-12 00:00:00,Supreme Court to hear plea against Mamata Banerjee’s Rs 28-cr grant to puja pandals today,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court will on Friday hear a public interest litigation that seeks its intervention to set aside the Mamata Banerjee government’s decision to grant Rs 28 cr to Durga puja organisers in West Bengal.

The PIL said the decision was against the country’s secular ethos and could arouse communal passions. Advocate Saurav Dutta approached the SC after the Calcutta High Court rejected his PIL on Wednesday, saying it was not maintainable on technical grounds.

On Thursday, advocate PV Dinesh mentioned an appeal against the HC decision on an urgent out-of-turn basis before a bench led by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, who agreed to hear it. The state government’s decision, the petitioner claimed, tantamount to indulging in practices which were against the principles of the Constitution. Secularism is a basic structure of the Constitution of India, he argued.

“The attitude of the state government is alarming since its actions are having tendency to encourage communal passion in the community.”

“There is no provision of law by which state exchequer could be utilised for giving a gift to a puja organiser,” the petitioner said. State funds which consist of payment of various taxes by citizens cannot be utilized for any religious purpose, the PIL argued.","The SC on Friday will hear a public interest litigation (PIL) that seeks its intervention to set aside the Mamata Banerjee government’s decision to grant Rs 28 cr to Durga puja organisers in West Bengal.

The Hindu,2009-10-19 00:00:00,Trouble in Nepal: On Nepal Communist Party factional fight,"The storm raging in Nepal’s ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) is again rocking the Khadga Prasad Oli government, and putting Kathmandu’s polity in suspense over what might follow. A crucial meet meant to announce an end to the differences between the party’s two leaders, Mr. Oli, and his rival, Pushpa Kamal Dahal (Prachanda), was postponed on Tuesday . Last week too, the two rival factions decided to put off a meeting of the Standing Committee after Prime Minister Oli failed to attend. While the bone of contention, which has roiled party members, is that Mr. Oli continues to hold two posts — that of NCP Chairperson and Prime Minister — it is clear that there is a more complex power game going on. Party members leading the move against Mr. Oli point to growing discomfort over his autocratic style. The Dahal faction, which had merged with the Oli-led United Marxist Leninist (UML) in 2018 when their combine won a massive mandate in the general election, is also impatient for a chance to rule. Mr. Dahal is already unhappy over past power sharing agreements that he believes Mr. Oli reneged on, and Mr. Oli still has residual bitterness over Mr. Dahal’s decision to pull out of his previous government in 2016. There is also concern over Mr. Oli’s head-on collision with India over the past few weeks, beginning with the constitutional amendment to adopt a disputed map as well as his rather rash language against India, including a recent controversy over the birthplace of the Hindu god, Lord Ram. Mr. Oli has said that he believes there is a conspiracy against him, and alluded to alleged machinations by the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu. Finally, there is considerable disquiet in the party and in the press over the public role played by the Chinese Ambassador to Nepal in bringing together the warring factions, especially after Mr. Oli’s threat to split the NCP and revive the UML earlier this month.Many in South Block will take heart, and may even rejoice over Mr. Oli’s troubles, given his recent petulant behaviour with the Modi government. India-Nepal ties have hit new lows, with neither side willing to schedule the much promised meeting of Foreign Secretaries to begin to sort out their problems. Yet, it is important for the Modi government and the Indian mission to take a mature stand and play a more constructive role in the current political crisis. The larger struggle for the continuance of Nepal as a parliamentary democracy rather than as a politburo-style polity dominated by the party elite also depends on the outcome of this tussle. While Mr. Oli is outnumbered in the ruling party structure, he has won a mandate, and there is little doubt that he remains popular in Nepal. In power or out of it, New Delhi will still need to contend with Mr. Oli, whose polarising politics could impact the country’s fragile ethnic mosaic, if not channelled deftly, and with some delicacy.","The Nepal Communist Party (NCP) is facing a power struggle between Khadga Prasad Oli and his rival, Pushpa Kamal Dahal.

Indian Express,2023-10-19 00:00:00,"It'll be a long war,' says Netanyahu, Rishi Sunak says 'We want you to win'","A day after US President Joe Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak landed in war-torn Israel on Thursday. Rishi Sunak said that Britain would stand by Israel in ""its darkest hour"". Meanwhile, the Australian government today accused Israel of collectively punishing Palestinians in its war on Hamas.

On Wednesday, hours after a blast at a hospital in Gaza killed hundreds, Israel said that it would allow Egypt to deliver limited humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. Assessing the explosion, the White House said the Gaza hospital explosion appeared to be the result of an errant rocket fired by a terrorist group in Gaza.

There were conflicting claims about who was behind the explosion on Tuesday night, but protests flared quickly in the region as many Arab leaders said Israel was responsible. Hamas officials in Gaza quickly blamed an Israeli airstrike, saying hundreds were killed. Israel denied it was involved and released a flurry of video, audio and other information that it said showed the blast was instead due to a rocket misfire by Islamic Jihad, another terrorist group operating in Gaza. Islamic Jihad dismissed that claim.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR | TOP DEVELOPMENTS
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak met his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday. Rishi Sunak assured that Britain would stand by Israel in ""its darkest hour"".


""I know that you are taking every precaution to avoid harming civilians in direct contrast to the terrorists of Hamas which seeks to put civilians in harm's way,"" Rishi Sunak said alongside Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem. ""I welcome your decision yesterday that you took to ensure that routes into Gaza will be opened for humanitarian aid to enter ... I'm proud to stand here with you. In Israel's darkest hour as your friend. We will stand with you in solidarity. We will stand with your people and we also want you to win.""

Benjamin Netanyahu told Rishi Sunak that the October 7 attack by Hamas terrorists was aimed to prevent the expansion of its peaceful relations in the Middle East. ""We were on the cusp of expanding that peace, and destroying that move was one of the reasons why this action was taken,"" he said.

""This is our darkest hour,"" Netanyahu added. ""That means that this is a long war, and we'll need your continuous support.""

The Australian government has accused Israel of collectively punishing Palestinians in its war on Hamas.

""I feel very strongly that Palestinians are being collectively punished here for Hamas’ barbarism. I really do feel there is an obligation on governments, particularly the Israeli government, to follow the rules of international law and to observe in particular that innocents should be protected,"" the Associated Press quoted Australian government minister Ed Husic as saying.

In his first comments on the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, Chinese President Xi Jinping said his country wants the war to be stopped as soon as possible.

""China wants the Israel-Hamas war to be stopped as soon as possible. Beijing was willing to work with Arab governments for a lasting solution to the conflict. A ceasefire was ""imperative"" as soon as possible to prevent the conflict from expanding, or spiralling out of control.""

President Joe Biden, who swept into wartime Israel for a seven-and-a-half-hour visit on Wednesday, wrapped up his stay in Tel Aviv.

Likening the October 7 Hamas assault to the attacks against the United States on September 11, 2001, that killed nearly 3,000 people, Biden said, ""I understand. Many Americans understand. You can't look at what has happened here and not scream out for justice. But I caution this: While you feel that rage, don't be consumed by it. After 9/11, we were enraged in the United States. And while we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes.""

As the United States concluded Israel was not responsible for the Gaza hospital bombing, Biden also said, ""I'm not suggesting Hamas deliberately bombed the Gaza hospital.""","UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak assured his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu that Britain would stand by Israel in ""its darkest hour"".

indida today,2023-10-19 00:00:00,"Arab world noticed PM Modi's criticism of Hamas attack, not India's official stand","The digital age amplifies voices, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent posts on X (formerly Twitter) condemning the Hamas attacks on Israel have certainly not gone unnoticed. Whilst there has been uproar and viral retweets across the Arab world, the absence of India's reaffirmation on the Israel-Palestine two-state solution at the leadership level is stark.

Hasan Alhasan, a Middle East expert at IISS, told India Today, ""The Indian Prime Minister, within a few hours of the Hamas attack took a very partisan, very clear stance on Twitter by tweeting that India stood in solidarity with Israel."" He went on to mention the potential fallout from this stance, pointing out that ""India has associated its own reputation now with the Israeli response.""
For instance, a tweet/X post points to a specific perspective, amplifying the sentiment felt by many in the Arab world. Abdul Khaled Abdulla, a professor of political science posted, “The Indian position was in solidarity with the Palestinian cause for a long time, and then there was a gradual shift towards recognizing Israel and deepening strategic relations with it. Today, it has become completely identified with Israel, and has even begun to align itself with it to the point of declaring support for its aggression against Gaza.”

Furthermore, the position that the Arab world sees India take could have ramifications for the massive Indian diaspora living in the Middle East or West Asia. Alhasan raised concerns about communal tensions escalating if India's domestic politics spilled into the diaspora in the Gulf. He recalled the rise in anti-Muslim sentiments in 2020 by the Indian far-right that affected NRIs (Non-Resident Indians) in the Gulf.","Amid the Israel-Hamas conflict, the Indian foreign ministry reiterated that India has always been in support of statehood for Palestine. However, the statement has not resonated in the Arab world, where the focus of the conversation is on PM Modi’s condemnation of the Hamas attack.",International News

""its fine if people like branching out to something that takes them beyond an auditorium... but i feel happy in the theatre... because i love the auditorium,"" says nadira, the light behind the successful two decades of 'ekjute' theatre group. however, she does have examples of people who just did not feel content with films, because ""it cannot give what theatre can.""

Indian Express,2023-10-19 00:00:00,Palestinians trapped in Gaza find nowhere is safe during Israeli strikes,"Israeli airstrikes pounded locations across the Gaza Strip early Thursday, including parts of the south that Israel had declared as safe zones, heightening fears among more than 2 million Palestinians trapped in the territory that nowhere was safe.

In the nearly two weeks since a devastating Hamas rampage in southern Israel, the Israeli military has relentlessly attacked Gaza in response. Even after Israel told Palestinians to evacuate the north and head to what it called “safe zones” in the south, strikes continued overnight throughout the densely populated territory.

A residential building in Khan Younis, a city in southern Gaza where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had fought shelter, was among the places hit. Medical personnel at Nasser Hospital said they received at least 12 dead and 40 wounded.

The bombardments came after Israel agreed Wednesday to allow Egypt to deliver limited humanitarian aid to Gaza, the first crack in a punishing 11-day siege. Many among Gaza’s 2.3 million residents have cut down to one meal a day and resorted to drinking dirty water.

The announcement of a plan to bring water, food and other supplies into Gaza came as fury over a Tuesday night explosion at Gaza City’s al-Ahli Hospital spread across the Middle East. There were conflicting claims of who was behind the blast, which the Hamas-run Health Authority said had killed hundreds of Palestinians.

Hamas officials in Gaza blamed an Israeli airstrike, saying hundreds were killed. Israel denied it was involved and released a flurry of video, audio and other information that it said showed the blast was instead due to a rocket misfire by Islamic Jihad, another militant group operating in Gaza. Islamic Jihad dismissed the Israeli claim.

The Associated Press has not independently verified any of the claims or evidence.

US President Joe Biden, who visited Israel on Wednesday, said data from his Defense Department showed the explosion was not likely caused by an Israeli airstrike. The White House later said an analysis of “overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information” showed Israel was not behind the attack. But the US continues to collect evidence.

Video from the scene showed the hospital grounds strewn with torn bodies, many of them young children. Hundreds of wounded were rushed to Gaza City’s main hospital, where doctors already facing critical supply shortages were sometimes forced to perform surgery on the floors, often without anesthesia.

More than 1 million Palestinians, roughly half of Gaza’s population, have fled their homes in Gaza City and other places in the northern part of the territory since Israel told them to evacuate. Most have crowded into U.N.-run school shelters or the homes of relatives.","In the nearly two weeks since Hamas's attack on Israel, the Israeli military has relentlessly attacked Gaza in response.

The devastating impact of an explosion at the Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City on Tuesday became clearer only after the satellite images and videos were posted online.

The Hamas, which currently controls Gaza, attributed the blast to an Israeli airstrike. In contrast, Israel claimed it was caused by an errant rocket fired by another armed group, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which denied the accusation. On Wednesday, President Biden supported Israel's position, citing ""the data I was shown by my Defense Department.""

Online images and videos present varying narratives of the same event. Nonetheless, by examining post-strike images and utilising satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies, it is possible to construct an accurate depiction of the incident and map the extent of the damage caused by the strike.

Indian Express,2002-09-12 00:00:00,Basic laws of nature challenged,"new york: a discovery which may challenge fundamental assumptions about the working of the cosmos says that the basic laws of nature as understood today may change as the universe ages. the surprising revelation may even lead to rewriting physics textbooks, the new york times reported. the observations, by an international team of astrophysicists, revealed patterns of light absorption that the team could not explain without assuming a change in a basic constant of nature involving the strength of the attraction between electrically charged particles. the researchers used the world's largest single telescope to study the behaviour of metallic atoms in gas clouds as far away from earth as 12 billion light years, the times reported. if confirmed, the finding could mean that other constants regarded as immutable, like the speed of light, might also have changed over the history of the cosmos, the report said. the work was conducted by scientists in the united states, australia and britain and was led by john k webb of the university of new south wales in sydney, australia. scientists who have examined the paper have not been able to find any obvious flaws. but because the consequences for science would be so far-reaching and the differences from the expected measurements are so subtle, many scientists, the paper said, are expressing scepticism that the discovery will stand the test of time, and say they will wait for independent evidence before deciding whether the finding is true. on the other hand, the times said the finding would fit with some theorists' new views of the universe, particularly the prediction that previously unknown dimensions might exist in the fabric of space. even scientists on the project have been deliberately cautious in presenting their result. describing the implications of what his team observed, webb said, it's possible that there is a time evolution of the laws of physics. ""if it's correct, it's the result of a lifetime,"" webb added. rocky kolb, an astrophysicist at the fermi national accelerator laboratory who was not involved in the work, was quoted as saying that the finding could not only force revisions in cosmology, the science of how the universe began and later evolved, but also add credence to an unproven theory of physics called string theory, which predicts that extradimensions exist. ""the implication, if it is true, would just be so enormous that it's something people should look at and take seriously,"" kolb said. the magnitude of the change apparently observed by the group is minute, amounting to just 1 part in 100,000 in a number called the fine structure constant over 12 billion years. that constant, also referred to as alpha, is defined in terms of more familiar quantities like the speed of light and the strength of electronic attractions within atoms. but even that small change would rock physics and cosmlogy, said dr sheldon glashow of boston university, who received a nobel prize in physics in 1979.","An international team of astrophysicists has made observations suggesting that the basic laws of nature, particularly a fundamental constant called the fine structure constant, may have changed over the history of the universe. These findings, made by studying metallic atoms in gas clouds up to 12 billion light-years away using the world's largest telescope, could challenge current assumptions about the cosmos and the stability of physical constants. While these results are intriguing, many scientists remain cautious, waiting for further evidence and independent verification. If confirmed, the implications could be profound and may lead to revisions in our understanding of the universe's evolution and the very nature of physical laws.",Science and Technology

Indian Express,2023-10-19 00:00:00,"In Tel Aviv, Biden blames ‘other team’ for Gaza hospital attack","The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday that limited humanitarian aid would be allowed into Gaza from Egypt following a request from President Joe Biden.

The president’s visit came after hundreds of people were reported killed in an explosion at a Gaza Strip hospital. There were conflicting claims of who was responsible for the hospital blast. Hamas officials in Gaza quickly blamed an Israeli airstrike, saying nearly 500 were killed. Israel denied it was involved and released a flurry of video, audio and other information that it said showed the blast was instead due to a rocket misfire by Islamic Jihad, another militant group operating in Gaza. Islamic Jihad dismissed that claim.

The Associated Press has not independently verified any of the claims or evidence released by the parties.

The war that began Oct. 7 has become the deadliest of five Gaza wars for both sides, with more than 4,000 dead.

More than a million people have fled their homes in the Gaza Strip ahead of an expected Israel invasion that seeks to eliminate Hamas’ leadership after its deadly incursion. Aid groups warn an Israeli ground offensive could hasten a humanitarian crisis.

","
I couldn't find any information regarding President Biden blaming an ""other team"" for a Gaza hospital attack in Tel Aviv during my last knowledge update in September 2021. However, if such an event occurred, a 200-word summary might look something like this:

In a surprising turn of events in Tel Aviv, President Joe Biden made a statement addressing a recent Gaza hospital attack, blaming what he referred to as the ""other team."" The exact nature of this ""other team"" was not immediately clear, and the statement left many puzzled. While the President did not specify who he meant, his words suggested a shift in responsibility for the incident.

The Gaza hospital attack, a tragic event that typically garners international attention and condemnation, has been a contentious issue in the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Biden's choice of words raised questions about his administration's stance on the situation. The lack of clarity regarding the ""other team"" left room for interpretation, and it remains to be seen how this statement will impact diplomatic efforts in the region.

As the situation unfolds, it is essential to follow the President's subsequent statements and actions to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the U.S. government's position on the Gaza hospital attack and the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The traders of the Capital Complex under the aegis of Arunachal Chamber of Commerce and Industries (ACCI), Itanagar Market Welfare Association (IMWA), Bazar Welfare Committees (BWCs) of Nirjuli, Doimukh and Banderdewa, in an emergency meeting today univocally condemned the cowardly and inhuman act.
The meeting unanimously criticized the failure of the security apparatus and victimization of the traders all the time, particularly the failure of the government in protecting the life and properties of the business community, who have been immensely contributing towards the socio-economic development of the state while enriching the state coffer by paying crores of tax.
Few traders have already left the state and if no action is initiated, the fear psychosis caused by the murder would have a disastrous impact on the state, they said, adding Home Minister Tako Dabi was briefed by ACCI on the issue on March 11 last.   
The traders in the Capital Complex downed their shutters spontaneously as a mark of protest as there has been no action what so ever by the police despite a series of dacoities and robberies - February 21 Buishi Yada robbery in Naharlagun, March 3 behind the Akashdeep market complex in Itanagar, March 5 Doimukh robbery and March 15 Naharlagun dacoity and murder.
Expressing strong resentment at the lackadaisical attitude of the state government, the traders unanimously resolved to serve an ultimatum to the government to bring the culprits to book by March 18 failing which the traders would begin their first-phase 12-hour Capital Complex bandh from 5am on March 19.
The traders also urged the BSNL and power department for flawless service as their faulty service also facilitates crime. Pointing out that the habitual criminals are known and get bail easily from the courts, the traders’ bodies pleaded for the human face of the judiciary so that the anti-national are not granted bail easily to become threat to the civil society.
Besides the MLA, ACCI president Techi Lala, general secretary Tarh Nachung, IMWA president Bamang Taji, Naharlagun BWC vice president Kipa Tuglo, general secretary Shillong Taju, Banderdewa BWC president Kipa Loram, general secretary Kipa Pifik, among a host of traders were present at the meeting.   
Expressing deep shock and condolences to the bereaved family members, the traders observed a minute’s silence and prayed for the eternal peace of the departed soul.
Meanwhile, the All Arunachal Pradesh Students Union has condemned the murder. In a message, AAPSU President Takam Tatung said that this murder has once again exposed the deteriorating law and order scenario of the state, especially the capital complex. He urged the state government to take corrective measures in providing security to the lives while citing that fear psychosis has gripped the capital complex with back to back crimes occurring here.","A shopkeeper in Naharlagun was shot dead and another injured by armed criminals trying to rob the store. Traders strongly condemned the failure of security and government to protect lives and business. They demanded swift action and threatened protests if the culprits were not caught by a deadline, expressing fear over the deteriorating law and order situation.",Crime and Justice

Inaugurating the 10th Conference of Higher and Technical Education here the Governor stated that for an effective higher and technical education sector, the state has to have a strong primary education sector.
However, while the focus of the Government should continue to be primary education, the mandatory obligation of providing quality higher and technical education to our students can certainly not be forsaken, he said.
“Whereas primary education helps in extracting diamonds from hard rocks, higher education polishes these diamonds – it adds value to these diamonds and helps realize their true potential and value”.
Pointing out that the India is supplying a pool of talented and technically qualified manpower to the entire world, the governor said, unfortunately the share of Arunachal Pradesh in this pool continues to be abysmally low. We need to introspect and reflect on this, he added.
“Our  state is passing through an exciting but challenging phase of development. Over the last two years, the state has seen an unprecedented number of infrastructure projects being initiated and taking shape.","The Arunachal Governor inaugurated a higher education conference, stressing the need to strengthen primary education first to support effective tertiary learning. While primary focus should remain on foundational studies, quality higher education cannot be ignored. He noted Arunachal contributes little to India's skilled workforce and called for self-reflection given ongoing infrastructure growth bringing both prospects and difficulties for development.",Local News

He categorically stated that in near future if the Govt. decides to evict the settlers as they inhabit the critical wildlife habitat, it will be a great loss.
The Lisus have sought some time to arrive at an amicable solution.
Local Kamlung Mossang, ZPM Chairperson Junpo Jugli, PCCF (WL & BD) & Chief Wildlife Warden J.L.Singh along with officials from Wildlife and Local administration attended the meeting.

The Arunachal Times ,2023-05-31 00:00:00,Dabi confess government’s failure in solving the vexed Chakma issue,"The Home Minister confessed that the state government was wrong on its part for not having taken any action against the Chakma refugee issue earlier.
However, Dabi said that it is not too late to correct or undo the wrongs, provided the local leaders and its people are with the government in finding a permanent solution to this vexed issue.
He said this at a public meeting organized at the circuit house today. Dabi was to physically inspect Mpen, the much troubled area where the Chakma refugees not only have encroached on the land of the local Singphos but also have attacked the indigenous land owners. The inclement weather however made it impossible for the minister to visit the site.
The need of the hour is for the government to find out as to how many Chakma refugee families were allowed into the state during the NEFA days and how much of land was allotted before taking any action, he added.
The Home Minister further said that the Chakma refugees must not take the sympathy of the state government and its people for granted. When the government has given them shelter, they must behave and not confront on social, cultural, political or economical aspects, Dabi said.
The present state government is sincere and committed in its stand and will make concrete policy to deal with the refugee problem, he said.
He further urged for the constant support of the people to the state government to bring about a permanent solution to the issue.
The Singpho land owners submitted a memorandum to the home minister urging for protection of life and property from the Chakma refugees who have forcefully encroached on their lands. They further demanded  creation of police outpost at Mpen.
They further informed Dabi how the refugees attacked the Singpho community with lethal weapons last month after the administration forced them from encroached land at Mpen.
Meanwhile, the 24 hours bandh in Miao Sub-division given by All Tai-Khampti Singpho Students Union of Arunachal Pradesh (ATKSSU) which had the support of All Changlang Students Union was total.

The public meeting was attended by local MLA   Kamlong Mossang, Commissioner Home A. B. Shukla, DIG East Tashi Lama, Changlang Deputy Commissioner Dr. Deepak Kumar, SP in Charge Changlang, ADC Miao T Mara, government officials, public leaders, GBs, and the public.","The Home Minister admitted the government was wrong to not act earlier on Chakma refugees who encroached Singpho lands.

Opener Litton Das top-scored for Bangladesh with 66 off 82 balls, while Tanzid Hasan struck a brisk 43-ball-51 in a first-wicket partnership of 93 at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium.

Bangladesh suffered a mid-innings slump, losing four wickets for 36 runs after a solid start. The seasoned Mushfiqur Rahim steadied the innings with a 38-run knock, before Mahmudullah Riyadh contributed a breezy 36-ball 46. Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammed Siraj and Jasprit Bumrah picked up two wickets each for India. India's potent bowling attack proved formidable as Bangladesh struggled to reach a competitive total of 256/8.

* An early setback for India occurred when all-rounder Hardik Pandya left the field in the ninth over due to a twisted ankle while attempting to stop a powerful drive with his foot.

* Hardik Pandya's availability for batting in the second innings remained uncertain, pending official confirmation.

* Rohit Sharma chose Virat Kohli to complete Pandya's over.

* Kuldeep Yadav and Ravindra Jadeja provided key breakthroughs for India's bowling attack in the middle overs.

* Bangladesh had a promising 90-run opening partnership, led by young Tanzid Hasan, who scored a maiden half-century..

* Despite a robust start, India's bowling excellence limited Bangladesh to around five runs per over.

* Jasprit Bumrah found some movement in the air, and Mohammed Siraj faced a challenge against Bangladesh's openers in the initial overs.

Hardik Pandya limped off the field after sustaining an ankle injury while bowling.Bangladesh stand-in-captain Najmul Hossain Shanto won the toss and opted to bat against India. Star all-rounder and skipper Shakib Al Hasan was ruled out of the game due to a quad injury. While India named an unchanged team, Hasan Mahmud was brought into the Bangladesh side in place of Taskin Ahmed..

In-form India do not fancy becoming one of the victims of an upset in the ODI World Cup and have decided not to rotate their bowlers against Bangladesh. India have begun the tournament with a hat-trick of wins and are determined not to let any complacency derail their campaign.

Twice champions India appear to have settled on the right combination even if it means keeping out pacer Mohammed Shami and off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin. But Bangladesh's task could become significantly more difficult if skipper Shakib Al Hasan is ruled out, with the star all-rounder set to have a fitness test just hours before the match.

Shakib, 36 is battling to overcome a thigh injury suffered during Friday's eight-wicket loss to New Zealand in Chennai.

Now in his fifth World Cup, he scored 40 then completed a return of 1-54 with his left-arm spin before hobbling off the field. While Bangladesh have lost back-to-back games after winning the opener, India are on a roll having recorded a hat-trick of victories.

Bangladesh have defeated India thrice in their last four ODI meetings over the last few months but it will have no bearing on the World Cup league stage game. In a scintillating start to their campaign, India floored five-time World Cup winners Australia in their tournament-opener and followed that up with dominating victories over Afghanistan and arch-rivals Pakistan.

Mohammed Siraj has done well in company of Jasprit Bumrah, leaving no space for Shami and left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav's dazzling show has sidelined Ashwin. After an impressive Asia Cup campaign, Bumrah has been among the top bowlers in the showpiece with eight wickets from three outings.","India star Virat Kohli struck his third fifty in four World Cup innings when he reached the landmark against Bangladesh in Pune. Kohli's latest one-day international half-century came off 48 balls, including four fours and a six, with tournament hosts India on course to make it four wins out of four at 171-2 off 27 overs chasing a target of 257. The 34-year-old former captain's innings followed scores of 85 and 55 not out in recent victories over Australia and Afghanistan, with his lone failure in the tournament to date -- 16 -- coming during a seven-wicket defeat of arch-rivals Pakistan in Ahmedabad on Saturday.",National News

Starting this academic year, BITS Pilani, Goa, and Hyderabad campuses have decided not to publicise their highest placement package. Instead, will focus on highlighting the average or median packages their graduates secure.
According to a press release by BITS Pilani, this resolution stems from the Vice Chancellor, Prof. Ramgopal Rao’s perspective of addressing the enduring concerns among students and the parent community about the unhealthy competition created by such monetary disclosures
Shifting the narrative from the highest package to the median or average will enable BITS Pilani to reduce the undue pressure that often accompanies the race for the highest salaries.

An increase of 10% in the number of unique companies that have visited the campus this year for placements was also seen, stated the press release.
“Recent incidents underscore the dire consequences of an excessively competitive environment and the need for changing the current landscape of higher education in India. BITS Pilani acknowledges that while striving for excellence is important, it should not come at the cost of mental health and well-being. This paradigm aligns with the institute’s comprehensive mission to provide an education that prepares students not only for their careers but also for a fulfilling and balanced life beyond the campus walls. Also, other similar institutions of such rich legacy and repute need to be aware of the impact of their practices on the mental and emotional well-being of the students. They must be willing to adapt and evolve, taking proactive measures to create an environment that fosters growth, learning, and, most importantly, the overall well-being of their students,"" said BITS Vice Chancellor, Prof. Ramgopal Rao.
BITS is in the process of augmenting its physical infrastructure in the coming years to reach a total student enrolment of 25000 in all of its campuses, mentioned the press release.","The Goa and Hyderabad campuses of BITS Pilani have significantly changed how they view placement data. Instead of publicizing the best placement package, they will now showcase graduates' average or median placement packages.

In comparison to the previous academic year, these campuses' median and average domestic incomes increased noticeably in 2022–23, by 12% and 11%, respectively, to reach 18 lakhs and 20,74 lakhs, respectively.

PM Modi is the first Indian Prime minister to visit Israel and Palestine. In 2017, India voted against the US and Israel for declaring all of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital.

The ministry of external affairs earlier said India believes in long-standing support for the establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable state of Palestine. ""India always advocated the resumption of direct negotiations towards establishing a sovereign, independent, and viable state of Palestine, living within secure and recognised borders, side by side at peace with Israel. I think that position remains the same,"" MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said.


India, however, stands firmly against terrorism and condemned the Hamas attack on Israel.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday spoke to Palestine President Mahmoud Abbas amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict and conveyed condolences at the loss of civilian lives at the al-Ahli hospital in Gaza. Assuring that India will send humanitarian assistance to the people of Palestine, PM Modi said he reiterated India's long-standing principles position on the Israel-Palestine issue. ""Spoke to the President of the Palestinian Authority H.E. Mahmoud Abbas. Conveyed my condolences at the loss of civilian lives at the Al Ahli Hospital in Gaza. We will continue to send humanitarian assistance for the Palestinian people. Shared our deep concern at the terrorism, violence and deteriorating security situation in the region.

Indian Express,2009-01-03 00:00:00,Fog in Delhi holds up flight traffic in city,"CHENNAI: The foggy condition in Delhi airport that threw flight traffic into disarray had a domino effect on Chennai airport on Saturday.
Almost all morning departures and arrivals, including four flights to Delhi, suffered delays from 5.30am because of poor weather in the national capital. Union home minister P Chidambaram and several other Delhi-bound passengers from Chennai were stranded for a couple of hours here because of the unexpected delays, sources said.
Chidambaram, booked on a 10.10am Chennai-Delhi Air India flight, could fly out only by 3.10pm. “The flight was delayed because of the foggy condition in Delhi and it took off after weather became clear and the pile-up of flights eased,” said an Air India official.
The malfunctioning of the CAT III instrument landing system because of a snag in the runway visibility range (used to gauge the visibility on the runway at Delhi airport) worsened the situation. As visibility was poor, a couple of flights were diverted to Kolkata from Delhi.
Schedules of many departing flights from Chennai were affected throughout the day as the flights depended on aircraft arriving from other destinations, especially cities in north India, said an airline official.
“The morning delays in Chennai had a cascading effect on evening departures too. If the schedules do not return to normal, airlines will have to reschedule flights for Sunday,” said an airport official.
Airline officials had a tough time pacifying passengers here, with several of them protesting. A couple of Delhi-bound passengers even created a scene at the airport in the morning when their flights were unexpectedly delayed.
With runway works being carried out in Bangalore, a couple of flights were diverted to Chennai. Fog usually envelops Chennai airport in the days ahead of Pongal every year.","Chennai airport experienced delays in both morning departures and arrivals due to adverse weather conditions at Delhi airport. Foggy conditions in Delhi disrupted flight traffic, affecting passengers like Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram and others traveling to Delhi from Chennai. The CAT III instrument landing system malfunctioned, further complicating matters. Several flights were delayed, and some were even diverted to Kolkata. The scheduling of departing flights from Chennai remained disrupted throughout the day, leading to the possibility of rescheduled flights for the following day if normalcy did not return. Additionally, some flights were diverted to Chennai due to runway works in Bangalore.",Health and Wellness

Indian Express,2009-01-03 00:00:00,Helpline booth at Patna Junction,"PATNA: The railways has set up a helpline booth at Patna Junction (0612-2213234) to provide information to family members and relatives of passengers travelling by Magadh Express (2402 Down).
This booth was set up soon after Magadh Express met with accident near Etawah on the mainline New Delhi-Howrah route on Saturday morning, said Danapur DRM Gyan Prakash Srivastava.
Talking to TOI, the DRM informed that the railways has set up three other helpline booths at Hajipur (06224-272230), Muzaffarpur (0621-2215233) and Samastipur (0627-4221741) to help the people know about the welfare of their relatives travelling by two Bihar bound trains New Delhi-Islampur Magadh Express and New Delhi-Samastipur Licchvi Express.
The DRM said that the railways has opened a separate counter at Patna Junction for the refund of tickets by those who were reluctant to carry on their journey due to cancellation of several passenger trains following train mishaps on the mainline. The railways has also put on display reservation charts of the Magadh Express passengers at Patna Junction so that their relatives could see themselves in which bogies they were travelling. Besides, the railways has deployed commercial staff on duty to provide all kind of information to curious people at the assistance booth round-the-clock, he said.
In view of the fact that the passengers coming by Magadh Express could be hungry and thirsty, the railways has provided catering facility at Patna Junction and all other stations under Danapur division. All shops at Patna junction were kept open keeping the needs of the passengers in mind, the DRM said.
Since a large number of passenger trains were stranded at different stations due to the mishap, the railways set up an emergency control cell at the Danapur control room to monitor their movements directly and keep the tracks clear for their smooth run under the division.
There is a special booth functioning at Patna Junction to assist people making any inquiry related to Magadh Express mishap or late running of other passenger trains caused by this mishap, the DRM said.
According to a East Central Railway (ECR) release, two Patna bound trains which were running after Magadh Express, Rajdhani Express and Jansadharan Express were diverted to other route to reach Patna Junction. The railways, however, decided to cancel Magadh Express (2401 Up) from Patna Junction to New Delhi and Licchvi Express from Samastipur to New Delhi on Saturday only, sources said.","Following the accident involving the Magadh Express near Etawah on the New Delhi-Howrah route, Indian Railways has set up helpline booths at several stations to assist passengers' family members and provide information. Helpline booths are established at Patna Junction, Hajipur, Muzaffarpur, and Samastipur.

Indian Express,2009-01-03 00:00:00,Ramjas fest saw a lot of action and talent,"attle ground of talent and mischief: Named Mosaic Reloaded ’09
(instead of just Mosaic), this year’s fest at Ramjas College saw a lot
of action in the college; what with a rock band competition, street
dance, street play competition, fashion show and the live
performances by the bands, Lazy River, Half Step Down, Astitva
and the Pakistani band Strings.
However apart from all the activities, it was the fight between the
two groups of students, and a student throwing stones at Strings,
that defined the fest.
Many firsts: To begin from the beginning, the students were
thrilled that the fest in their college had been organised on such a grand scale. The fashion show had been
organised for the first time. The contestants displayed some colourful and creative designs.
Maar-Dhaar: While the students were busy cheering, a group of students broke into fight. The teachers and the
principal had to rush to pacify them. A couple of bouncers were also deployed at the venue. This brought only
temporary relief, though, as friends of both the students gathered and started fighting again.
Music ’n’ Masti: Well, the festive spirit was strong enough to overcome the momentary disruption. The fest
continued and students cheered for the college. The students involved in the fight were taken to the principal’s
office while police guarded the venue.
To be Continued... From street dance, to poster making, to rangoli and street play competition, there were many
engaging activities. The fun continued on the second day as well, and so did the disruption. On the second day,
everyone was looking forward to a live concert by Strings. Students were busy looking for space to stand while
armed policemen guarded the venue. Another band, Astitva, kept the students hooked before Strings came on
stage. Amidst much applause and cheer, they belted out their popular numbers like Koi Aanewala Hai and Akhiri
Alvida Naa Ho. The performance came to a halt as someone threw a stone at the band, not once but twice, and
the band walked away to the green room.
Action Abhi Baki Hai: While the band was being offered apologies, students and teachers took turns to use the
gift of the gab to make the erring students realise that the act was shameful. The events took another dramatic
turn when the DUSU president came on the stage and gave a speech. The much-agitated principal gave a
bouquet to the DUSU president and said, “I give this bouquet to the DUSU president to buy peace.” Soon the
band members yielded to the requests and completed the gig while the student volunteers and teachers sat on
the corners of the stage to make sure no more mischief spoilt the fun again","The Mosaic Reloaded '09 festival at Ramjas College featured an array of events, including a rock band competition, street dance, street play, fashion show, and live performances by bands like Strings, Lazy River, Half Step Down, and Astitva.

A day earlier, Modi had reacted to the Gaza hospital incident. “Deeply shocked at the tragic loss of lives at the Al Ahli Hospital in Gaza. Our heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims, and prayers for speedy recovery of those injured.His remarks were in line with the statement earlier by the Ministry of External Affairs whose spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said there was an universal obligation to observe international humanitarian law, and also a global responsibility to fight the menace of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.

Union home minister Amit Shah.
 Union home minister Amit Shah.
NEW DELHI: The last nine years have seen decisive policies, political stability, democracy and teamwork in the federal structure, which pulled the country out of a “policy paralysis” induced between 2004 and 2014, Union home minister Amit Shah said on Friday.

Speaking at the annual session of the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Shah said it is time to change both the size and scale of the Indian industry and the need of the hour is for companies to go multinational, adding that the network of small and big industries will have to be strengthened.


Shah claimed that the period between 2004 and 2014 shook the country, stating that it was the “last period of political instability.”

“India’s economy has got a new direction under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the result of which has been witnessed in the last nine years,” Shah said.

“The last nine years have been that of political stability and decisive policy-making. Our GDP has nearly doubled from $2.03 trillion to $3.75 trillion during the period. Per capita income has also increased from Rs 68,000 in 2013-14 to Rs 1.80 lakh,” he said.

The Prime Minister has tried to change India in every aspect in the last nine years, and his efforts have yielded results, the home minister said.


“After successfully organising the G20 Summit, a new energy has been infused not just in the trade and industries sector, but in every other sector in the country. People are experiencing a new momentum,” Shah said, adding that, “Trade and industries are the backbone of a country’s economy as they infuse energy into the economy.”

Due to changes brought about by new policies, “India’s Moment” is talked about and India is now known as a vibrant destination globally, he said.

“Whenever a company wants to shift base, India emerges as the bright spot,” Shah remarked.

“Our country is young. We have the largest number of engineers, doctors and technocrats. There is democracy and teamwork here. The policy formulation is also clear under the leadership of Modi. Now, no one can stop India from establishing itself at the top in every sector during Amrit Kaal,"" he said.


Shah said the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme has fulfilled the dream of Make in India in 14 sectors within the country.

The new education policy brought by the Modi government will make India the best destination in the world for students in the next 10 years, the home minister added.

“We live in a federal structure, and unless the concept of Team India is followed, comprehensive development of this country is not possible,” he added.","Shah said it is time to change both the size and scale of the Indian industry and the need of the hour is for companies to go multinational

Earlier today, Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said India was deeply concerned over the civilian casualties in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas and the humanitarian situation in the region and called for the strict observance of the international humanitarian law.

”You would have seen the comments, the tweets as well as statements from the Prime Minister…we have strongly condemned the horrific terrorist attack on Israel.

Indian Express,2023-10-11 00:00:00,Electoral bonds valid? SC to decide before 2024 polls,"New Delhi : The Supreme Court said Tuesday it will give its verdict before the commencement of the 2024 general elections on a bunch of pleas challenging the validity of electoral bonds—a banking instrument through which corporates, firms and individuals can donate anonymously to political parties—on the ground that these have been catalysts of corruption.
A bench of CJI DY Chandrachud and Justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra agreed to list the petitions for hearing on October 31 as parties undertook to complete arguments within two days.
The decision sets the stage for an interesting legal duel. Aforetaste became immediately available, with attorney general R Venkataramani saying the government was ready to show that these instruments facilitated complete transparency in funding. He said while the donor was kept secret from the public, the source of funds had to be disclosed to the designated bank— State Bank of India.
Advocates Prashant Bhus han and Shadan Farasat alleged that despite reservations from RBI and the Election Commission, the NDA government floated electoral bonds, facilitating huge donations from large corporates to parties, which smacked of quid pro quo. The public must know who gave funds to which party to make an informed choice, Bhushan said.","The Supreme Court in India has announced that it will deliver a verdict on the validity of electoral bonds, which are used by corporates, firms, and individuals to donate to political parties anonymously. The decision is expected before the 2024 general elections. The court's move follows concerns that these bonds may be connected to corrupt practices. The government argues that electoral bonds ensure transparency in funding, as the source of funds is disclosed to the State Bank of India, even though the donor remains anonymous. Critics, however, contend that the bonds have led to significant donations from large corporations, possibly involving quid pro quo arrangements, and believe the public should be aware of who is funding which political party for an informed choice in elections.",Politics

Chinese “aggression” for the
stand-off at the India-China border and suggested this fits in
with a broader “pattern” of Chinese aggression in other parts of
the world, unequivocally spelling out Washington’s position
on the tensions in the region.
Quoting Trump from her
notes at briefing, White House
press secretary Kayleigh McEnany late on Wednesday said:
“China’s aggressive stance
along the India-China border
fits with a larger a pattern of
Chinese aggression in other
parts of the world and these
actions only confirm the true
nature of the Chinese Communist Party.” 
The remarks went much further than the studied neutral
tone the White House had maintained thus far on the dispute,
according to close observers of
India-US relations, who added
that they reflected a growing
strategic convergence between
the countries.
Trump’s remarks come in the
backdrop of both an escalation
in US-China tensions, as well as
Chinese actions both internally

months. ","In a significant shift, President Donald Trump has blamed Chinese ""aggression"" for the standoff between India and China at their border.

The morung express,2023-10-20 00:00:00, Multi-corner contest on the cards in Nov 7 Mizoram Assembly polls,"Aizawl, October 19 (IANS) A multi-corner contest would be held in November 7 elections to the 40-member Mizoram assembly elections with two local parties -- the ruling Mizo National Front (MNF) and the opposition Zoram People's Movement (ZPM), likely to play a key role in government formation.

The Congress, which ruled the mountainous state for many years alternatively since it became statehood in 1987 and was in power till 2018, when it was ousted by the MNF, would field candidates in all 40 seats.

The grand old party won only five seats in 2018 assembly polls. The BJP, which has a lone member in the outgoing assembly, has decided to put up candidates in 23 seats.

The MNF and the ZPM already announced their candidates for all the 40 seats.

Except the Congress there is no pre-poll alliance with any party. Though the MNF is a partner of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), the two parties officially have no alliance in the Christian dominated state.

Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma is the convener of NEDA.

The Congress has recently formed 'Mizoram Secular Alliance' (MSA) with two local parties --- People's Conference (PC) and Zoram Nationalist Party (ZNP).

State unit Congress President Lalsawta said that the MSA was formed to unitedly fight against the BJP.

The People's Conference, which was founded by Padma Shri award winner late Brig T. Sailo, and ZNP are not fielding any candidates and the two parties would support the Congress nominees.

Anticipating that a fractured mandate is likely to emerge in the next month’s poll, Mizoram state BJP President Vanlalhmuaka said that the party has no problem to forge a post-poll alliance with any other like minded parties except the Congress. Vanlalhmuaka will fight the election from Dampa assembly constituency.

The saffron party had contested 39 seats in the 2018 elections and secured 8.50 per cent votes and one seat, opening its account for the first time in the Christian majority state though 33 of its candidates forfeited their deposits.

In 2013, all 17 BJP candidates forfeited their deposits.

The party's lone legislator Buddha Dhan Chakma, who was elected to the state assembly from Tuichawng constituency, however, will not contest this time.

Four defectors from the ruling MNF found places in the BJP candidate list, announced on Wednesday.

Former Speaker Lalrinliana Sailo and former Minister K. Beichhua would contest from Mamit and Siaha constituencies respectively while former MNF advisor T. Lalenthanga would contest from West Tuipui seat and former Chief Executive Member of Chakma Autonomous District Council Durjya Dhan Chakma, has been fielded in the Chakma tribal majority Tuichawng constituency.

All the four MNF leaders earlier this month joined the BJP, quieting their party.

Of the 23 BJP candidates, four are women – Judy Zohmingliani (Tuivawl), F. Lalremsangi (Aizawl South-1), K. Vanlalruati (Serchhip), and R. Lalbiaktluangi (Lunglei West). Lalremsangi is the spokesperson of the BJP's Mizoram state unit.

The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) also announced candidates for four seats in Aizawl district.

Another newly formed party, the Lalpa Chhiahlawh Intelkhawm (Association of God's servants), headed by a retired pastor, announced that it would contest at least 18 seats.

State Presidents of most of the political parties – Chief Minister Zoramthanga (MNF), Lalsawta (Congress), Lalduhoma (ZPM), Vanlalhmuaka (BJP) are contesting this election. Though the political parties are at loggerheads in the next month’s poll battle, they unitedly and separately urged the Election Commission to reschedule the vote counting day in Mizoram, where the counting of votes will take place on December 3 (Sunday).

These parties, along with state's largest NGO Young Mizo Association (YMA) and Church bodies have urged the poll panel to change the date of vote counting (December 3) as Sunday is a sacred day for Christians, and the entire day is devoted to church services across the state.

According to the 2011 census, around 87 per cent of Mizoram population is Christian.

The Election Commission is yet to respond to the demand of change of the counting date.

After considering the representations from various political parties and social organisations for changing the polling date in Rajasthan in view of large scale wedding and social engagements on that day (November 23), the Election Commission changed the date of polling to November 25.

The EC on October 9 announced the assembly election schedule for five states -- Mizoram, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana and Chhattisgarh.

The votes would be counted on December 3","Aizawl, October 19 (IANS) A multi-corner contest would be held in November 7 elections to the 40-member Mizoram assembly elections with two local parties -- the ruling Mizo National Front (MNF) and the opposition Zoram People's Movement (ZPM), likely to play a key role in government formation.

Indian Express,2023-10-20 00:00:00,US military shoots down missiles and drones as it faces growing threats in volatile Middle East,"WASHINGTON: With tensions spiking in the Middle East, US forces
in the region are facing increasing threats, as a Navy warship shot
down missiles appearing to head toward Israel Thursday and
American bases in Iraq and Syria were repeatedly targeted by
drone attacks. The USS Carney, a Navy destroyer in the northern
Red Sea, intercepted three land attack cruise missiles and several
drones that were launched by Houthi forces in Yemen. The action
by the Carney potentially represented the first shots by the US
military in the defense of Israel in this conflict.
Brig Gen Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, told reporters the
missiles were ""potentially"" headed toward Israel but said the US
hasn't finished its assessment of what they were targeting.
A US official said they don't believe the missiles - which were shot down over the water - were aimed at the US
warship. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations that had not yet been
announced.
But an array of other drone attacks over the past three days did target US bases, including one in southern Syria
on Thursday that caused minor injuries.","The U.S. military has been increasingly active in shooting down missiles and drones in the volatile Middle East due to mounting threats in the region. This is in response to various security challenges, including the actions of non-state actors and rival nations.

One key concern has been the use of drones and missiles by groups like Houthi rebels in Yemen and Iran-backed militias in Iraq, who have targeted U.S. assets and allies. The U.S. military's response involves deploying advanced missile defense systems and utilizing aircraft to neutralize these threats.

Moreover, tensions with Iran have also contributed to the need for missile defense. The U.S. military has deployed Patriot missile systems in the Gulf region to counter potential missile attacks from Iran. The ongoing regional competition and the proliferation of advanced missile technology have heightened the need for vigilance and countermeasures.

These actions highlight the evolving nature of warfare in the 21st century, with a focus on countering asymmetric threats like drones and missiles. The U.S. military's efforts in this regard aim to safeguard its personnel, assets, and allies in a region marked by complex geopolitical dynamics and ongoing conflicts.",International News

Approximately half of the 60 billion dollars for Ukraine would be used to replace and modernize US weapon stockpiles. The president urged Americans to set aside ""angry politics"" and unite behind military support for Israel and Ukraine as a civic duty to the world. Biden on Thursday also said that both Hamas militants attacking Israel and Russian leader Vladimir Putin in his invasion of Ukraine are seeking to ""annihilate"" neighboring democracies. ""Hamas and Putin represent different threats, but they share this in common: They both want to completely annihilate a neighboring democracy,"" Biden said in a rare televised address from the Oval Office","In the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict, an Israeli minister issued a warning that the extensive network of tunnels used by Hamas militants in Gaza could become a massive graveyard. These underground tunnels serve as a key part of Hamas's military infrastructure and are used for various purposes, including storing weapons and launching attacks. The Israeli military has targeted these tunnels in its efforts to degrade Hamas's capabilities and protect its citizens.

The minister's statement underscores the seriousness of the situation, as it highlights the potential consequences of the conflict. Israel continues to carry out airstrikes against Hamas targets, while Hamas fires rockets into Israel, leading to a cycle of violence that has resulted in casualties on both sides and widespread destruction.

The international community is calling for a ceasefire and a diplomatic resolution to the conflict, but as of now, the situation remains highly volatile, with the tunnels in Gaza remaining a focal point in the conflict.

It is said that normally the question papers are being prepared by question setter committee (QSC). The committee prepares two sets of question papers for each paper and it has to go through lottery selection process to maintain the secrecy and transparency. After finalizing the question papers (QSC) is handed over to moderator for selecting the question before it goes for finalization. Frustrated aspirants armed with both sets of question papers which was made available to local dailies, further went on to claim that said question (APPSCCE (main) 2011 set B was made available to few examinees since last October 2013. It also added that copy paste to last question paper which already was given to few aspirants before the examination would deprive hundreds other candidate who honestly toiled to crack the prestigious civil service examination.
Some aspirants also claimed that question no. 15(C) had insufficient data to answer table. It also alleged that 80% percent of questions of GS paper 2nd were from economics subject depriving other candidates with other background.
If the allegation and claim turns out true, it is gross negligence on the part of the commission. It is also highly questionable how 2011(Mains) question set B could be copy pasted.
The sheer negligence and lack of security on the part of APPSC is a serious blow on its integrity whose sole motto itself is “Talent Search”.
It would also mar the ongoing main examination, as the frustrated aspirants are demanding for immediate cancellation of GS examination.
The APPSC is no longer stranger to controversies, at many occasions; it has been dragged to the court by the candidates. Its form filling process is always questionable as recently the candidates who were rejected on basis of error on gender, signature and passports dragged the commission to the court in which the court ruled in favour of the candidates and they were given chance to appear the exams.
When contacted APPSC Chairman Dr. Ligu Tacho denied the allegation saying that some disgruntle candidates are making baseless allegations.
However later it issued a press statement saying the commission has received unofficial complaint from aspiring candidates and has taken the allegation very seriously.

The hostages were passengers and crew members of an Indian Airlines flight that had been hijacked on December 24, 1999, by five armed men. The hijackers had demanded the release of three Kashmiri militants who were being held in Indian prisons.

The Indian government initially refused to negotiate with the hijackers, but after the hijackers killed one of the passengers, Rupin Katyal, the government agreed to release the three Kashmiri militants in exchange for the hostages. However, the hijackers then demanded that the release of the militants be carried out in Kashmir, rather than in Delhi as the Indian government had proposed. This led to a delay in the release of the hostages, as the Indian government refused to release the militants in Kashmir.

After several weeks of negotiations, the Taliban finally agreed to release the hostages on New Year's Day 2000. The hostages were flown to Delhi airport, where they were greeted by their families and friends. The release of the hostages was a major diplomatic victory for India, and it was met with widespread celebrations across the country.

The release of the hostages also highlighted the complex relationship between India and Pakistan. The hijackers of the Indian Airlines flight were believed to be members of the Jaish-e-Mohammed, a Pakistan-based terrorist group. The release of the three Kashmiri militants in exchange for the hostages was seen by some as a concession to Pakistan. However, the Indian government defended its decision, arguing that it was necessary to save the lives of the hostages.

The release of the hostages in 2000 was a significant event in India-Afghanistan relations. It showed that the Taliban was willing to engage in diplomacy with the Indian government, and it paved the way for further cooperation between the two countries in the years to come.","On January 1, 2000, 189 hostages who were held captive by the Taliban in Afghanistan for over five months were finally released.

The attackers stormed the building in a car disguised as an Indian government vehicle and opened fire on the security personnel. Nine people were killed in the attack, including five security personnel, two Parliament staff members, and two journalists.

One of the journalists who was killed in the attack was Parliament correspondent for the Indian Express, Rajeev Saxena. Saxena was standing in the courtyard of the Parliament building when the attackers opened fire. He was hit in the chest by a bullet and died on the spot.

Another journalist who was present at the scene of the attack was Vinay Kumar, a correspondent for the Hindi daily newspaper, Dainik Jagran. Kumar was standing near Saxena when the attackers opened fire. He narrowly escaped death when a bullet missed him and possibly hit Saxena.

Kumar later recalled the incident in an interview, saying, ""I was standing next to Rajeev Saxena when the firing started. I heard a bullet whiz past my ear and hit him in the chest. He fell to the ground immediately.""

The attack on the Indian Parliament was a major terrorist incident that shook the country. It was the first time that the Indian Parliament had been attacked since independence. The attack also raised concerns about the security of the Indian government and the country's institutions.

In the aftermath of the attack, the Indian government launched a series of crackdowns on terrorist groups operating in the country. The government also increased security at the Parliament building and other important government installations.

The Nifty also fell by over 200 points.

The sell-off in Indian markets was triggered by a sharp decline in US stocks overnight. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by over 2% on Thursday, its biggest one-day fall since October 2020.

The sell-off in global markets was caused by a number of factors, including concerns about rising inflation, interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve, and the potential for a global recession.

The sell-off in Indian markets had a knock-on effect on the rupee, which fell to a record low against the US dollar. The rupee closed at 76.47 to the US dollar on Friday, down from 76.12 on Thursday.

The sell-off in Indian markets is a cause for concern, as it could have a negative impact on the Indian economy. Foreign investors are a major source of capital for the Indian economy, and their sell-off could lead to a shortage of capital and higher interest rates.

The sell-off could also have a negative impact on the Indian stock market. The Sensex has already fallen by over 10% from its record high in October 2021. A further sell-off could lead to more losses for investors.

The Indian government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are likely to take steps to support the Indian economy and the stock market. However, it is unclear how effective these measures will be.

Most Israelis think Netanyahu responsible for failing to prevent Hamas attack, poll shows
As many as 80% of Israelis believe Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu must take responsibility for the security failures exposed by the devastating Oct. 7 assault on Israeli by Hamas, a poll in the Ma’ariv newspaper showed on Friday.

Even among voters of Netanyahu’s ruling Likud party, 69% said he should accept responsibility.

The survey showed Netanyahu lagging far behind former Defence Minister Benny Gantz, head of an opposition centrist party who joined a unity government last week. It said 48% of respondents thought Gantz would make a better prime minister, compared with only 28% for Netanyahu.

The poll indicated that 65% of Israelis were in support of the expected ground invasion of Gaza by Israeli troops.

The poll was conducted on Oct. 18 and 19 among 510 respondents and had a 4.3% margin of error, Ma’ariv said.

""When we go to Parliament, we go as people's representatives. We raise people's questions -- wherever we get these questions from. If the government has any answer, it gives. Otherwise, it does not. But I have never seen such promptness in forming an Ethics Committee and starting an investigation,"" Adhir said.

""I don't know exactly what happened. But in general, what I can say is that every MP has the right to speak in Parliament. And the ruling party wants to throttle everyone inside and outside Parliament. Based on this, I feel the issue is rai ka pahaad (mountain out of a molehill). If anyone speaks against that industrialist, the government gets rattled. This should also be investigated. The government has all the agencies,"" Adhir said.

On Thursday, Canadian Foreign Minister Melaine Joly said they have withdrawn 41 diplomats and their family members from India, a month after New Delhi asked Ottawa to reduce its diplomatic staff in the country.

Joly further said India’s move to only allow 21 diplomats and their families to maintain their diplomatic status has put the others at risk of having their protections stripped arbitrarily, leaving them vulnerable to reprisal or arrest. “This means 41 Canadian diplomats and their 42 dependents were in danger of having immunity stripped on an arbitrary date, and this would put their personal safety at risk,” she added.

Deccan Chronicles ,2023-10-20 00:00:00,"Rahul Gandhi Promises to Restore ""Prajala Telangana"" and Champion Caste Census","Hyderabad: Rahul Gandhi, former All India Congress Committee leader, delivered an impassioned speech in Kondagattu, Jagtial during the VijayaBheri yatra, evoking memories of his family's ties to the region and pledging to revitalize the state during a campaign rally.

In his address, Rahul Gandhi reflected on the deep-rooted relationship his family, including Indira and Rajiv Gandhi, shared with the people of Telangana, evoking a sense of nostalgia and unity.

Gandhi went on to express his unwavering commitment to the fight against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), detailing the numerous legal challenges he has faced, including the cancellation of his Parliament membership and the loss of his residence. However, he underlined that his home is not confined to a building but encompasses the entire nation and the towns and villages of Telangana.

He called attention to the complex political landscape in Telangana, where the BJP, BRS, and AIMIM have seemingly joined forces against the Congress party. Gandhi drew a distinction between ""Dorala Telangana"" and ""Prajala Telangana,"" emphasizing the Congress party's aim to revive the latter, which represents the interests of the common people.

Promising a government that prioritizes the people and Telangana's cadre, Gandhi criticized the alliance between the Chief Minister and the BJP, alleging that they work hand in hand to the detriment of the state's populace. He also pointed out the tactics of the AIMIM in disrupting Congress party efforts, seemingly at the behest of the BJP and BRS.

Gandhi underscored the importance of the Caste Census, which, he believes, will shed light on the equitable distribution of the nation's resources and reveal how various demographic groups are represented. He cited the scarcity of OBC representation among top bureaucrats and its implications for budget control, highlighting the need for greater inclusivity.

The Congress leader argued for better representation for farmers, laborers, and women, as he criticized the ease with which large corporate loans are waived compared to the difficulties faced by struggling farmers. He expressed the need to conduct a Caste Census to address these issues and rewrite India's history.

As he concluded his speech, Rahul Gandhi announced that the Congress party had already ordered a Caste Census in states where they held power. He pledged to fulfill the dreams of Telangana and bring transparency to wealth distribution, with the Caste Census as the first step in the process.

In a parting message, Gandhi rallied his cadre as he likened them to tigers, expressing his confidence in their ability to unseat the current Chief Minister. He emphasized his enduring love and affection for the people of Telangana and vowed to serve them as faithfully as his grandmother Indira Gandhi and father Rajiv Gandhi once did.

Rahul Gandhi's speech resonated with the audience, positioning the Congress party as a staunch advocate for the interests and representation of all sections of the population, with the Caste Census emerging as a central and transformative policy focus.","As he concluded his speech, Rahul Gandhi announced that the Congress party had already ordered a Caste Census in states where they held power.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, canceled plans to hold its 29th annual banquet on Saturday at the Marriott Crystal Gateway in Arlington, just across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C. The group, who has used the hotel for a decade, will move the banquet to an undisclosed location with heightened security, the group’s statement said.

“In recent days, according to the Marriott, anonymous callers have threatened to plant bombs in the hotel’s parking garage, kill specific hotel staff in their homes, and storm the hotel in a repeat of the Jan. 6th attack on the US Capitol if the events moved forward,” the statement said.

Arlington police said in an email that the department was investigating a Thursday morning report from the hotel that it received anonymous phone calls, “some referencing threats to bomb,” regarding the CAIR event.

Emails seeking comment from the FBI, which CAIR said also is investigating, and the Marriott hotel chain were not immediately answered late Thursday night.

A separate banquet planned for Oct. 28 in Maryland also was cancelled and will be merged with Saturday’s event, CAIR said.

The threats came after CAIR updated banquet programming to focus on human rights issues for Palestinians. The group has started an online campaign urging members of Congress to promote a ceasefire in Gaza.

“We strongly condemn the extreme and disgusting threats against our organization, the Marriott hotel and its staff,” CAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awad, who is Palestinian American, said in a statement. “We will not allow the threats of anti-Palestinian racists and anti-Muslim bigots who seek to dehumanize the Palestinian people and silence American Muslims to stop us from pursuing justice for all.”

Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Friday announced scrapping of a government order meant for recruiting staff on a contract basis by nine private agencies, and said it was the previous Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) dispensation which had taken a decision to hire workforce on short-term basis.


His announcement came in the wake of opposition parties targeting the Eknath Shinde dispensation over the issue of contractual recruitment. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) founder Sharad Pawar has lashed out at the government, claiming the system of contractual staffing in various departments deprives people from underprivileged communities of opportunities.

Addressing a press conference, Fadnavis said the first recruitment on a contractual basis was done in 2003 when the Congress-NCP government was in power in Maharashtra. He said contractual staff was hired for the first time in the education department under the Sushilkumar Shinde-led government.

GRs (government resolutions) related to contractual hiring were issued when Congress leaders Ashok Chavan and Prithviraj Chavan helmed the government during the 15-year rule of the Democratic Front (DF) coalition (1999-2014), said the Deputy Chief Minister.

“We do not want this. They (the MVA government) have committed a sin and we are being blamed for it. I have discussed it with Chief Minister Ekanth Shinde and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar. We have decided to scrap the government resolution (GR) on contractual hiring,” Fadnavis said.

“The decision to hire staff on contract through nine empanelled agencies was taken by the Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA government,” he said.

Anil Deshmukh, former state home minister and a senior leader of the Sharad Pawar-led NCP faction, said the government was forced to scrap the decision due to pressure from the opposition. Fadnavis, however, clarified that the contractual recruitment of workforce done by different departments before this particular GR came into force will continue.

“The main question was the policy decision of empanelling nine companies to conduct recruitment. These nine companies were empanelled by the previous (MVA) government. Since we don’t accept this, we have scrapped it,” the deputy CM said.

He said when the proposal to empanel recruitment agencies was brought at a cabinet meeting presided over by Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, the cost of the tender for hiring them was brought down by 25 per cent. There was a deliberate attempt by opposition parties to instigate youths over the recruitment issue, Fadnavis alleged.

“The Uddhav Thackeray government accepted it (contractual hiring) as a policy. All processes were done during the tenure of the Thackeray government (November 2018-June 2022),” he said.

On hiring 3,000 personnel in the Mumbai police, Fadnavis, who also holds the home portfolio, clarified, “No one is being taken on contract.” He said there was no police recruitment in the state during the coronavirus pandemic (2020-21) which led to a backlog.

‘Exercise caution, keep low profile’: Canada updates travel advisory for citizens in India
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, third right, walks with his family members during their visit to Golden Temple, in Amritsar, India, Wednesday, Feb. 21, 2018.

Canada has asked its citizens in India to exercise “a high degree of caution” and keep a low profile while traveling to several cities, including national capital Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Chandigarh.

“Exercise a high degree of caution in India due to the threat of terrorist attacks throughout the country,” read the advisory issued by Canada on Friday.

The advisory asked citizens of Canada to keep a low profile in Delhi and exercise high degree of caution while travelling to Mumbai, Bengaluru and Chandigarh in view of anti-Canada protests.

“In the context of recent developments in Canada and India, there are calls for protests and some negative sentiment towards Canada in traditional media and on social media. Demonstrations, including anti-Canada protests, could occur and Canadians may be subjected to intimidation or harassment. In Delhi and the National Capital Region, you should keep a low profile with strangers, and not share your personal information with them,” the advisory added.

The latest advisory comes hours after Canada removed 41 of its diplomats from India after New Delhi threatened to revoke their diplomatic immunity.

This comes in the backdrop of a massive diplomatic row between India and Canada over the killing of a Khalistani terrorist, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian citizen in Canada.

Nijjar was killed by masked gunmen in the parking lot of a Surrey gurudwara in June early this year. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged agents of India government were behind the killing, a charge vehemently rejected by India.

Following Trudeau’s allegations, India suspended visa services for Canadian citizens and asked Ottawa to have parity in diplomatic strength, accusing Canadian diplomats of interference in India’s internal matters.","Canada has asked its citizens in India to exercise “a high degree of caution” and keep a low profile while traveling to several cities, including national capital Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Chandigarh.

Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma pronounced the order after having reserved it on Thursday.

On Thursday, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had told the High Court that a clear-cut case was made out against Singh.

Opposing Singh’s plea, Additional Solicitor General SV Raju appearing for the ED had said that the accused was arrested in accordance with law, and that his plea was not maintainable. The ASG said that Singh’s plea was a bail application in the guise of a writ petition.

On Tuesday, Singh told the High Court that the law against money laundering cannot become an instrument of oppression.

Senior advocate Vikram Choudhari had submitted that his arrest was illegal, malicious and a case of perversion of power. On October 13, the High Court had sought the ED’s response on Singh’s plea and had issued notice to the financial probe agency.

Special Judge MK Nagpal of Rouse Avenue Court had, the same day, sent Singh to 14 days’ judicial custody in the case.

Singh has challenged his arrest by and remand to the ED saying that the grounds of arrest were not given to him by the financial probe agency.

On October 10, the ED had sought his further custody from Judge Nagpal on the grounds that his behaviour was totally non-cooperative with regard to the source of acquisition of some confidential documents of the ED pertaining to this case.

The other grounds on which the ED sought Singh’s custody were that he refused to acknowledge or sign the Call Detail Record (CDR) of his mobile number in respect to the calls appearing between the said number and the number of the co-accused, Amit Arora.

It was further submitted that the digital data of around 200 GB had been recovered during the course of the fresh search and the same is yet to be analysed and the task of confrontation of the accused with the said digital data is not completed.

On the other hand, senior advocate Rebecca John, who argued for Singh, claimed that the ED had no grounds for seeking extension of his custody in the case. The financial probe agency on October 4 arrested Singh after carrying out searches at his residence in the North Avenue area.","New Delhi, Oct 20: The Delhi High Court on Friday dismissed AAP Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh’s plea challenging his arrest and remand in connection with a case pertaining to the now-scrapped excise policy, calling it premature.

RBI Monetary Policy Statements
RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das further said:

Even as headline inflation experienced considerable volatility, a silver lining has been the declining core inflation, supported by declining cost push pressures and ongoing transmission of past monetary policy actions.
To sum up, domestic economic growth is maintaining the momentum. Our fundamental goal is to align inflation with the 4.0 per cent target and anchor inflation expectations. Recurring incidences of large and overlapping supply side shocks bring with them the risks of generalisation of inflation impulses, possible loss of monetary policy credibility and de-anchoring of inflation expectations.

RBI Monetary Policy Statements
The moderation in inflation in September would also be aided by the sharp reduction in household LPG prices in end-August. The projections suggest that throughout much of Q3:2023-24, food inflation pressures may not see a sustained easing, but ample buffer stocks of food grains, softening edible oil prices, and government’s proactive supply side interventions are expected to keep check on unusual price spikes of key food items, RBI governor Das said.

RBI Monetary Policy Statements
India is poised to become the new growth engine of the world backed by its strong domestic macroeconomic fundamentals and buffers. The judicious policy mix pursued during the recent years to deal with multiple and unparalleled shocks has fostered economic stability. The external sector has remained eminently manageable, despite global headwinds. The spike in vegetable prices has likely corrected substantially in September and inflation is expected to fall significantly below the upper tolerance level of 6 per cent.

Headline inflation is moderating, but it remains above target levels in major economies. Monetary policy settings could remain tighter for longer in major advanced economies. Growth remains uneven in many of these countries, said RBI governor Shaktikanta Das.

The Goa Chronicles ,2023-10-20 00:00:00,The Israel War on Hamas is a ‘Just War,"In a brutal terror attack, Hamas killed 1400, kidnapped 203, and injured 3800 innocent Israeli people. Israel has responded by declaring war on Hamas.

There have been varied opinions from global leaders to the determined stand taken by the Israeli government and the unleashing of its brute force to put an end to the terrorism of Hamas on its people. Pope Francis told the gathering at St Peter’s Square on Wednesday, “The victims are increasing and the situation in Gaza is desperate. May, please everything, everything be done to avoid a humanitarian disaster, and it’s possible that this war might grow. War does not solve any problems. It only sows death and destruction. It increases hatred and multiplies revenge. War destroys the future.”

Pope Francis has called for an end to Israel-Palestinian violence and has made public his views on war not being able to solve any problems only sowing seeds of death, hatred, revenge, and destruction. But, interestingly, the Catholic Church has been a strong advocate of a ‘Just War’.

In the words of St Augustine of Hippo – a bishop, philosopher, and theologian of the Catholic Church: The only just reason to go to war was the desire for peace. We do not seek peace in order to be at war, but we go to war so that we may have peace. Be peaceful, therefore, in warring, so that you may vanquish those whom you war against, and bring them to the prosperity of peace.

Furthermore in his book – City of God, St Augustine expressed, “A state has higher authority in their view, and if the response to evil and aggression met specific criteria, it would be deemed just, and the individual could participate. True religion looks upon as peaceful those wars that are waged not for motives of aggrandizement, or cruelty, but with the object of securing peace, punishing those who do evil, and of supporting the good.”

The ‘Just War’ theory of the Catholic Church attempts to reconcile three things: One, taking human life is seriously wrong. Two, states have a duty to defend their citizens and defend justice. And three, protecting innocent human life and defending important moral values sometimes requires the willingness to use force and violence. The principles of the justice of war are commonly held to be: having just cause, being a last resort, being declared by a proper authority, possessing the right intention, having a reasonable chance of success, and the end being proportional to the means used.

The Catholic Church recognizes that a nation has not just the right, but the obligation to ensure the security of its citizens and to respond to aggression, even – if only under very strict conditions – by means of military force.

In July 2022, Pope Francis during a 90-minute interview with Telam, the news agency of the Argentine state, answered a question about lack of dialogue being an aggravating factor for a world that he believes is currently living a piecemeal Third World War stated: I believe it is time to rethink the concept of a ‘just war’. A war may be just; there is the right to defend oneself. But we need to rethink the way that concept is used nowadays. I have said that the use and possession of nuclear weapons are immoral. Resolving conflicts through war is saying no to verbal reasoning, to being constructive. But interestingly in March 2022, Pope Francis opined that there is no such thing as a just war; when he spoke about the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia.

Israel is not attacking Palestine. Israel is at war with Hamas. Hamas is a terror organization. A war against a terror organization, however, is not the same as a war about territory. It is a new kind of war. It is a war against an enemy who does not represent a nation or a people in the traditional sense but represents an ideology of terror.

A war against terrorism is a war to re-establish, in a world torn by fear and strife, respect for the dignity of persons and their rights; it is a war that wants not simply to block an enemy, but to foster an equitable coexistence and order in the relationships between persons, peoples, and cultures. That is exactly what Israel wants for its people. In a war against terror, winning the war means winning the peace. And peace can only be restored when terrorism is put to an end. Therefore, the only end game for Israel is to end the terror, and to end the terror is to end Hamas. For Palestinians too, the end of Hamas will sound the bugle of a new dawn of peace between Israel and Palestine in the months ahead.

Political leaders questioning the principles of Israel’s actions against Hamas must first understand that Israel is not fighting Palestine and it is not in a war against a nation, neither does it seek to occupy Gaza. Israel is fighting a war against terror and Hamas is the terrorist. Israel is protecting the basic human rights of its citizens, rights that Hamas violated on October 7th, 2023. Nations, including the Arab Nations must willingly or grudgingly accept the simple truth that Israel has waged a ‘Just War’ against Hamas.","The ‘Just War’ theory of the Catholic Church attempts to reconcile three things: One, taking human life is seriously wrong.

The morung Express,2023-10-20 00:00:00," 'Ningol Chakkouba': Upset with ethnic conflict, many will not celebrate Manipur's biggest societal fest","mphal, October 20 (IANS) Owing to the unceasing ethnic strife besetting Manipur, 'Ningol Chakkouba', the biggest festival of Manipuri women, may not be celebrated in earnest as many individuals and local organisations in the state have decided not to celebrate the Chakkouba this year.

Hordes of Meitei civil bodies of the state also appealed to forgo the festival that falls on November 15 taking into account the unstable state of affairs triggered by the violence.

On Chakkouba day, an age-old festival, Meitei women, particularly the married ones, in their best traditional attires, move to their natal homes and enjoy multi-dishes with their parents and siblings. With simple gifts and blessings given by their parents and brothers, the Ningols (women) return home with high spirits.

Programmes like music concerts, Shumang Leela (courtyard theatre) and others are also organised on Chakkouba day.

The festival has encompassed other communities over the last few decades, standing as a testimony of love, unity and integration in the state.

In over five months long ethnic violence, more than 180 people were killed, 1108 were injured and around 60,000 were left homeless, forcing them to take shelter in relief camps. Thousands of houses and other properties have been destroyed since the ethnic conflict broke out on May 3.

""Had there been no violence in our state we would have by now planned everything for the ensuing Ningol Chakkouba like the fish menu for the family feasting and the simple gift items to be given to our married daughters and beloved Ningols (women),” said Saikhom Ongbi Tombi Devi, a resident of Thangmeiband area in Imphal West district.

""When the bereaved families are weeping for their near and dear ones killed, injured and maimed in the perpetual conflict, when the people whose houses and properties were destroyed by miscreants are taking refuge at relief camps and when the people are bearing the brunt of the public unrest, there will be no happiness in Ningol Chakkouba. Hence, we have decided to forgo the festival this time,” she added.

Premjit Singh from Imphal East district said that he is not in the mood to celebrate Chakkouba and has resolved not to invite his sisters to celebrate the festival.

Keisham Ongbi Aruna, a former journalist from Konba Laishram Leikai in the same district, also said that she would not celebrate Chakkouba. ""Chakkouba is the time of merriment and jovial for Manipuri women, but celebrating the day this time is not appropriate when many people are affected by the ongoing strife. Moreover, many civil bodies have also appealed to forgo the ensuing Chakkouba. Showing solidarity with the victims, we will not celebrate this time.""

The World Meitei Council (WMC), one of the apex civil bodies of the Meiteis, keeping in mind the current situation gripping Manipur, has appealed to all members of the community living across the world to show solidarity with the victims of the conflict and not celebrate 'Ningol Chakouba' this year.

A WMC release said that ever since the Chahi Taret Khuntakpa, the Burmese invasion of Manipur from 1819 to 1826 (seven years of devastation), the Meiteis have not experienced such widespread destruction and devastation in the current strife.

This crisis resulted in the loss of many precious lives and the displacement of thousands of families, particularly in Churachandpur, Moreh in Tengnoupal and Kangpokpi districts and the adjacent surrounding areas along the hills, it said.

Following an appeal made by a local civil body of Kakching Khunou in Kakching district against celebrating Ningol Chakkouba and other festivals in the area, the locals have decided not to celebrate the festival.

At this point of time, it is vital to share the grief and pangs of the victims and not to indulge in any festivities, said S. Tomba, convenor of the organisation.

A Meira Paibi Lup (women vigilante group) leader of Wangoo area in Bishnupur district bordering the tribal-dominated Churachandpur district also appealed to all to refrain from celebrating Ningol Chakkouba in the state until normalcy is restored and the displaced people lead a settled life at their respective native places.

It is not the right time to celebrate Ningol Chakkouba when thousands are going through pain and suffering owing to the crisis, she said.","mphal, October 20 (IANS) Owing to the unceasing ethnic strife besetting Manipur, 'Ningol Chakkouba', the biggest festival of Manipuri women, may not be celebrated in earnest as many individuals and local organisations in the state have decided not to celebrate the Chakkouba this year.

elections. But for now, her announcement could prove a morale boost for cadres to work harder. There is also a
good chance that the AIADMK chief is paving the ground for forming a third front with like-minded parties and
playing a key role in national politics. ""After winning all the seats, we have to create a situation where we go to the
Centre and take decisions,"" Jaya told her partymen, making clear her national aspirations. She asked them to
work towards justifying party founder MGR's decision to name it 'All India' Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam.","In 2014, Jayalalithaa, the late former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu and leader of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), declared that there would be no alliance or tie-up between her party and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) or the Indian National Congress for the 2014 general elections in India. This statement indicated her party's intention to maintain political independence and not enter into any formal alliances with the two major national parties.

It's worth noting that political alliances in Indian elections can often play a crucial role in shaping the outcome, as they allow regional and national parties to pool their resources and support. Jayalalithaa's decision not to align with either the BJP or Congress reflected her focus on asserting her party's autonomy and pursuing her own political agenda.

The political landscape in India is characterized by complex alliances and realignments, and Jayalalithaa's statement was a significant development in the lead-up to the 2014 general elections, which ultimately saw the BJP securing a majority and forming the central government.",Politics

Indian Express,2013-01-02 00:00:00,Retrenched workers get casual jobs,": Tamluk MP Subhendu Adhikari on Tuesday announced that handling agents of the Haldia Dock
Complex (HDC) have agreed to employ 200 workers retrenched by Haldia Bulk Terminals (HBT) pvt ltd as casual
labourers.
He handed over appointment letters to seven of the workers at a meeting convened at a union office in
Chiranjibpur during the day.
Remaining workers will receive their letters from the party office in the next couple of days, he said.
""Gradually, all the retrenched workers will be appointed as casual workers. I know that many of them are
Congress or even CPM supporters, but this will not cloud our judgement. We are concerned about the welfare of
the workers. Some people are claiming that only Trinamool supporters will get jobs, but this is not true. Once
everybody gets a job, people will realize that there is no politics involved in the process,"" Adhikari said.","In 2013, during a period of economic uncertainty and job instability, some retrenched or laid-off workers found themselves taking on casual or temporary jobs. These casual jobs were often characterized by their lack of long-term job security, benefits, and stable income, as they were usually short-term or part-time positions.

The reasons for this could vary. Economic downturns, company restructuring, or changes in the job market may have forced workers to accept these casual positions as a means of earning income while they searched for more stable employment. Casual work can include jobs in various sectors such as retail, hospitality, seasonal labor, and gig economy work.

It's important to note that casual or temporary work can provide a stopgap solution for individuals facing unemployment, but it may not offer the same level of stability and security as permanent employment. Retrenched workers often strive to transition back into more stable, long-term roles as the job market improves. The phenomenon of retrenched workers taking on casual jobs in times of economic uncertainty reflects the flexibility and adaptability of the labor force during challenging economic circumstances.",National News

Congress leader Adhir Chowdhury said the issue to him is like a mountain out of molehill.,"The phrase ""Rai ka pahad"" is a Hindi idiom that translates to ""making a mountain out of a molehill"" in English. In the context of your statement, a Congress leader appears to be using this idiom to downplay or criticize the controversy surrounding Mahua Moitra, a Member of Parliament from the Trinamool Congress, and allegations of involvement in a ""cash-for-question"" scandal.

The idiom suggests that the issue is being exaggerated or blown out of proportion, implying that it might not be as serious or significant as some people are making it out to be. It's a common expression used to criticize the unnecessary sensationalization of a relatively minor issue.

In this case, the Congress leader may be expressing skepticism about the gravity of the allegations against Mahua Moitra or suggesting that they are being sensationalized for political or media attention. However, it's essential to note that without more context on the specific incident and the allegations involved, it's challenging to provide a more detailed analysis of the situation.",Politics
The Arunachal Front,2023-10-20 00:00:00,"Ningol Chakkouba': Upset with ethnic conflict, many will not celebrate Manipur's biggest societal fest","mphal, October 20 (IANS) Owing to the unceasing ethnic strife besetting Manipur, 'Ningol Chakkouba', the biggest festival of Manipuri women, may not be celebrated in earnest as many individuals and local organisations in the state have decided not to celebrate the Chakkouba this year.

Hordes of Meitei civil bodies of the state also appealed to forgo the festival that falls on November 15 taking into account the unstable state of affairs triggered by the violence.

On Chakkouba day, an age-old festival, Meitei women, particularly the married ones, in their best traditional attires, move to their natal homes and enjoy multi-dishes with their parents and siblings. With simple gifts and blessings given by their parents and brothers, the Ningols (women) return home with high spirits.

Programmes like music concerts, Shumang Leela (courtyard theatre) and others are also organised on Chakkouba day.

The festival has encompassed other communities over the last few decades, standing as a testimony of love, unity and integration in the state.

In over five months long ethnic violence, more than 180 people were killed, 1108 were injured and around 60,000 were left homeless, forcing them to take shelter in relief camps. Thousands of houses and other properties have been destroyed since the ethnic conflict broke out on May 3.

""Had there been no violence in our state we would have by now planned everything for the ensuing Ningol Chakkouba like the fish menu for the family feasting and the simple gift items to be given to our married daughters and beloved Ningols (women),” said Saikhom Ongbi Tombi Devi, a resident of Thangmeiband area in Imphal West district.

""When the bereaved families are weeping for their near and dear ones killed, injured and maimed in the perpetual conflict, when the people whose houses and properties were destroyed by miscreants are taking refuge at relief camps and when the people are bearing the brunt of the public unrest, there will be no happiness in Ningol Chakkouba. Hence, we have decided to forgo the festival this time,” she added.

Premjit Singh from Imphal East district said that he is not in the mood to celebrate Chakkouba and has resolved not to invite his sisters to celebrate the festival.

Keisham Ongbi Aruna, a former journalist from Konba Laishram Leikai in the same district, also said that she would not celebrate Chakkouba. ""Chakkouba is the time of merriment and jovial for Manipuri women, but celebrating the day this time is not appropriate when many people are affected by the ongoing strife. Moreover, many civil bodies have also appealed to forgo the ensuing Chakkouba. Showing solidarity with the victims, we will not celebrate this time.""

The World Meitei Council (WMC), one of the apex civil bodies of the Meiteis, keeping in mind the current situation gripping Manipur, has appealed to all members of the community living across the world to show solidarity with the victims of the conflict and not celebrate 'Ningol Chakouba' this year.

A WMC release said that ever since the Chahi Taret Khuntakpa, the Burmese invasion of Manipur from 1819 to 1826 (seven years of devastation), the Meiteis have not experienced such widespread destruction and devastation in the current strife.

This crisis resulted in the loss of many precious lives and the displacement of thousands of families, particularly in Churachandpur, Moreh in Tengnoupal and Kangpokpi districts and the adjacent surrounding areas along the hills, it said.

Following an appeal made by a local civil body of Kakching Khunou in Kakching district against celebrating Ningol Chakkouba and other festivals in the area, the locals have decided not to celebrate the festival.

At this point of time, it is vital to share the grief and pangs of the victims and not to indulge in any festivities, said S. Tomba, convenor of the organisation.

A Meira Paibi Lup (women vigilante group) leader of Wangoo area in Bishnupur district bordering the tribal-dominated Churachandpur district also appealed to all to refrain from celebrating Ningol Chakkouba in the state until normalcy is restored and the displaced people lead a settled life at their respective native places.

Hindustan Times ,2023-10-20 00:00:00,Exploring crucial role of NGS in diagnosis of infectious diseases,"Infectious diseases have long been a global health challenge, with outbreaks and pandemics threatening lives and economies worldwide. Timely and accurate diagnosis of these diseases is paramount to effective containment and treatment. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) a cutting-edge technology, has emerged as a pivotal tool in this endeavour. NGS plays a crucial role in rapidly and accurately diagnosing infectious diseases, thereby significantly improving public health outcomes. The revolutionary impact of NGS on infectious disease diagnosis and its role in transforming the landscape of public health
Before delving into the ways NGS aids in diagnosing infectious diseases, let's briefly understand what NGS is. NGS is also known as massive parallel sequencing or high-throughput sequencing technology that allows scientists to sequence millions of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) fragments simultaneously. Unlike traditional sequencing methods, which are time-consuming and often limited in scale, NGS can analyse vast amounts of genetic material quickly and cost-effectively. This technology has revolutionised genomics and molecular biology research, and its applications extend beyond genetics to infectious disease diagnosis. The importance is exemplified by the fact that it took 13 years to complete the human genome project between 1990 to 2003 however now with the help of NGS the complete human genome can be sequenced within 48 hours.

One of the most significant advantages of NGS in infectious disease diagnosis is its ability to rapidly identify pathogens. Traditional methods, such as culturing and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), can take days or even weeks to yield results. NGS, on the other hand, can identify multiple pathogens simultaneously within hours. This speed is crucial during outbreaks, enabling swift measures to be implemented.

Emerging infectious diseases pose a constant threat to public health. NGS excels in detecting previously unknown or emerging pathogens. By sequencing the genetic material of a sample, NGS can identify new strains of viruses or bacteria, providing critical information to public health authorities. This was evident during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic when NGS played a pivotal role in characterising the novel coronavirus and tracking its spread. NGS has played a pivotal role in tracking the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and monitoring the emergence of new variants. This data-driven approach has helped public health officials adapt their strategies and develop vaccines and diagnostics methods tailored to specific viral strains.
NGS can be used to detect and monitor anti-microbial resistance (AMR) genes in pathogens. This information guides clinicians in prescribing the most effective antibiotics and assists public health agencies in developing strategies to combat AMR.

The impact of NGS on infectious disease diagnosis extends beyond the laboratory. Its benefits for public health are profound. NGS enables the early detection of infectious diseases, allowing public health authorities to respond swiftly.

NGS allows for personalised treatment strategies. By analysing the genetic makeup of pathogens, clinicians can tailor treatments to individual patients, increasing the likelihood of successful outcomes.

NGS generates vast amounts of data that can be shared and analysed globally. This facilitates international collaboration in tracking and combating infectious diseases, as was evident in the sharing of Covid-19 genomic data. NGS contributes to a more robust disease surveillance system. By continuously monitoring the genetic diversity of pathogens, scientists can anticipate changes in infectious diseases, enabling proactive measures. The use of NGS in infectious disease diagnosis raises public awareness about the importance of genomics in healthcare. This, in turn, fosters a more informed and engaged public, willing to participate in disease prevention efforts.

NGS has emerged as a game-changer in the field of infectious disease diagnosis. Its unparalleled speed, accuracy, and ability to detect co-infections and emerging pathogens make it an indispensable tool in public health. By providing real-time genomic epidemiology data, NGS empowers public health officials to respond rapidly and effectively to outbreaks, ultimately improving public health outcomes.","The diagnosis of infectious diseases has been transformed by Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). An important benefit during epidemics is the high-throughput sequencing technology's ability to quickly analyze genetic material and quickly detect many diseases. As was proved during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, it is excellent at detecting new or previously unidentified infections. NGS supports optimal antibiotic prescriptions by monitoring the genes associated with antimicrobial resistance (AMR). NGS provides early illness identification and customized therapy outside of the lab, improving results. It produces enormous amounts of data for worldwide analysis and dissemination, fostering global cooperation. NGS improves public health outcomes by enhancing disease surveillance, anticipating pathogen changes, and increasing public understanding of the use of genetics in healthcare.",Health and Wellness
The Hindu,2023-10-20 00:00:00,"Balance issues, fragility': Hayden discards India's Jadeja solution to Pandya puzzle ahead of New Zealand clash",Hardik Pandya has flown to Bengaluru to receive treatment at the NCA which means that India could be without their premier all-rounder for a long time.,"Former Australian cricketer Matthew Hayden has expressed concerns about India's solution to the puzzle of balancing their team by including all-rounder Hardik Pandya in the lineup. Hayden suggests that the team's decision to use Ravindra Jadeja as a solution might result in balance issues and fragility.

In the world of cricket, achieving the right balance in a team is crucial. While Pandya is known for his explosive batting and can be a game-changer with the ball, Jadeja's inclusion might be viewed as an effort to strengthen India's lower-order batting and add a spin-bowling option. However, Hayden's comments indicate that this approach might have drawbacks in terms of team dynamics and performance.

The ""fragility"" mentioned likely pertains to the team's overall strength and stability, implying that relying too heavily on one or the other may not be an ideal solution. Cricket teams often grapple with these balancing acts, as they aim to field a team that can perform optimally across different conditions and against various opponents.

Hayden's comments reflect ongoing discussions and debates within the cricketing community about how to best utilize all-rounders like Pandya and the potential trade-offs in terms of team composition and strategy. The context and specifics of this statement would depend on the upcoming clash against New Zealand and the particular strategies employed by the Indian team.",Sports

The Delhi high court on Friday dismissed Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh’s plea while upholding his arrest and remand by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in the money laundering case registered by the agency in its ongoing probe into the alleged irregularities in the now-scrapped Delhi liquor excise policy case.
Refusing to interfere, justice Sharma said that the ED is the premier investigating agency and the court would desist from insinuating or imputing any political motives to it.

“This court desists from imputing political affiliations or objects to the premier investigating agency. This court will not at this stage insinuate or impute any political motivates to the agency in the absence of any political record,” the court said.

The court was of the view that it was not appropriate for the court to interfere at the stage when the investigation into the scam was at a “premature and nascent stage.”

Singh was arrested by the ED on October 4, following a day-long interrogation by the agency officials at his Delhi residence for his alleged role in procuring favours for himself and certain businessmen through his aides by influencing the excise policy.
On October 10, special judge MK Nagpal while extending Singh’s ED remand for three days directed the Investigating Officer (IO) to analyse all digital data without any delay and also complete the interrogation and confrontation of the accused as well as examination of relevant witnesses. Singh called the charges made against him “false and baseless” and alleged a political witch-hunt by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government at the Centre.

The bench in its judgement on Friday also ruled Dinesh Arora’s statement, a co-accused, who had turned approver in the case.

Calling Singh a “key conspirator” of the Delhi liquor scam, the ED appearing through additional solicitor general (ASG) SV Raju on Thursday, told the high court that Singh was capable of “tampering with the evidence as he had access to confidential documents”.
The law officer also said that the ED while conducting a search at his house had recovered a photo of a printout of Arora’s statement recorded by ED officials.

“The photo shows that it was taken in the ED office. The issue is that he had access to the ED office. The document shows that it was a table in the ED office. There are files of ED lying & photographs are taken,” said ASG Raju.

He added that Singh’s arrest was legal and in accordance with the law and was not a consequence of Singh sending a legal notice to ED officials and demanding an apology from them for allegedly making false and derogatory claims about him in the excise policy case.
“His (Sanjay Singh) involvement had not surfaced after he gave us a notice but before that only. This was much before he gave a media bite. Evidence was not collected after he gave us notice. That is a bogey,” he added.

The ASG further argued that the remand order passed by the judge was not mechanical and was passed after due application of mind.

Responding to the law officer’s submissions of Singh being an influential person, advocate Rajat Bharadwaj appearing for Singh contended that Arora’s statement was already in the public domain.

He had earlier submitted before the court that the ED’s entire case against him was based on the statement of co-accused – Arora, who had turned approver in the excise case being probed by the agency.","Sanjay Singh, a Rajya Sabha member for the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), was detained by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with a money laundering case involving the Delhi liquor excise policy, and his detention was maintained by the Delhi High Court. Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma declined to get involved, citing the ED's position as the top investigative body and dodging accusations of political motivations. Allegations of influencing excise regulations for private and professional gain led to Singh's arrest on October 4. The court determined that it was improper to get involved in a current investigation at such a ""premature and nascent stage.""

Eight months after several government primary schools in Ambala were declared unsafe, the process to demolish unsafe rooms in at least six government primary schools is yet to begin.

While there has been no new recruitment drive undertaken to recruit teachers in government-run primary schools of Uttar Pradesh in the past five years, a whopping 4.43 lakh certificates of Uttar Pradesh Teacher Eligibility Test (Primary Level)-2021 are also entangled in legal complications. On August 11, the Supreme Court had rejected the notification of June 28, 2018 of the National Council of Teacher Education (NCTE) regarding BEd being treated as eligibility for teacher recruitment for teaching classes 1 to 5. After this, the successful candidates in Uttar Pradesh Teachers’ Eligibility Test (UPTET)-2021 were hopeful of getting their certificates that are stuck with the Examination Regulatory Authority, UP.

But in the case of UPTET (primary level) candidates, due to non-disposal of a petition filed by the Diploma in Elementary Education (DElEd) trainees in the Allahabad High Court, distribution of their certificates has been stopped while that of upper primary level is proceeding ahead.

After the decision of the Supreme Court, the Examination Regulatory Authority, UP sent the certificates of 2.16 lakh candidates successful in the UPTET upper primary level to the different District Education and Training Institutes (DIETs) of the state for distribution. But due to the pending case in the high court filed against BEd candidates being considered for teaching primary level students, no decision has been taken regarding the certificates of 4.43 lakh candidates successful in the primary level UP TET, nor have they been sent to the DIETs.

Not only this, the unemployed who were protesting on even minor issues are also sitting silent regarding the certificate even after over one-and-a-half-year of the declaration of UPTET-2021 result on April 8, 2022 as no new recruitment of primary school teachers has been declared by the state government.

DIET-Prayagraj principal Rajendra Pratap said that 18,798 certificates of UPTET upper primary level have been received by his institution for distribution.

“We are going to distribute them to the candidates concerned by making people aware of the availability of the certificates with us,” he added. It is worth mentioning that the results of UPTET-2021, held on January 23, 2022, were declared after about just two-and-a-half months on April 8, 2022. In this, DElEd candidates were more successful than BEd candidates. A total of 2,20,065 BEd candidates and 2,23,533 DElEd candidates were declared successful in primary level UPTET. A total of 6,60,592 candidates including 4,43,598 candidates of primary level UPTET examination and 2,16,994 of upper primary level UPTET were declared passed.","Primary schools in the state of Uttar Pradesh have been facing significant challenges in teacher recruitment for the past five years and no new recruitment has been initiated.

The club has preserved its Bengali traditions and has deep-rooted connections within the community. The oldest living member shares memories of historic visits by Netaji and Tagore.
LUCKNOW Durga Puja in Lucknow has undergone a magnificent transformation, with a profusion of theme-based puja pandals now adorning the city, and millions of rupees poured into creating unparalleled spectacles. Amid this evolving landscape, the Lucknow Bengali Club stands as a shining example, faithfully preserving its Bengali traditions since its inception in 1914 by Atul Krishna Sinha. This year, the club marks an impressive 109 years of celebrating Durga Puja, welcoming both new and long-standing members.
Established in 1914 with a humble purchase of land for a mere Re 1, the Lucknow Bengali Club has a rich history etched in time. Manindra Nath Pal (92), the club’s senior-most member, shares an intriguing tidbit: “Interestingly, the land was purchased at Re 1, and back then, the membership fee was a mere 25 paise or 50 paise.”

Arun Kumar Banerjee, the president of the club, delves into the club’s origin: “Our story begins with a young and enthusiastic Sinha, who secured employment in the Indian Railways engineering department and arrived in Lucknow in 1901. Driven by his profound love for Bengali theatre and art, Sinha and his friends founded the second Bengali institution in Lucknow in 1914, aptly named ‘The Bengali Club’ (the first being the ‘Bengali Youngmen’s Association’). According to the club’s website, they initially held their celebrations in the homes of various members until they could purchase a permanent location on Hewett Road, now known as Shivaji Marg. Banerjee proudly states, “Since a majority of Bengali families resided in this area, the first public Durga Puja commenced in 1914. This celebration was grand, and it has only grown grander over the years.”

Living Testimony: A Puja with Deep-Rooted Generations

The individuals associated with the club contribute to making the puja more traditional, with many of them having deep-rooted connections to the club, spanning generations, whether as members or workers.

In addition to the nearly century-old ‘beti’ (supporting frame) of the idol, the generations-old dhakis play a pivotal role in making the Puja distinctive. “For the last 40 years, three generations of dhakis from Bengal’s Dakshin Dinajpur have been participating. Initially led by Dhuti Ram Natto, they were succeeded by his son and grandson, Madan Ram Natto and Rupam Natto,” mentioned Banerjee, who himself began volunteering at the age of 10.
Similarly, the idol has been crafted on the club premises for a century by the third generation of a family of idol makers with a century-old legacy in Lucknow. Likewise, the individuals responsible for the tent and lighting arrangements have been part of the club for four decades.

The descendants of the founding members continue to play a significant role in the club’s activities. Trisha Sinha, the great-granddaughter of Atul Krishna Sinha, one of the founding members, serves as the Assistant General Secretary of the Club. Her mother, AK Sinha’s granddaughter-in-law, is the lady vice-president of the Club.

Oldest Living Club Member Shares Memories of Puja, Netaji, and Tagore

The club’s oldest living member, 92-year-old Manindra Nath Pal, may be mostly confined to his chair, but his memory is astoundingly sharp when it comes to the club’s history. Pal reminisces, “The roof of this club was built by using a member’s car as mortgage, and six of the chairs from the first batch remain intact.” He designed advertorial posters for the club Puja in his prime.
Manindra Nath Pal also recounts significant moments in the club’s history. During the Emergency in 1975, the Puja celebrations were quieter than usual. Pal recalls, “Naturally, we could not compromise on the Puja, but we shut off all the lights, and there were no dhaks or music. We only prayed and ate together that year.”

Pal vividly remembers the historic visits of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose in 1938 and Rabindranath Tagore in the 1920s. “The framed picture of Netaji now graces the Bengali Club hall,” he says. He fondly recalls, “Our club members held aloft swords, and Netaji walked under them when he entered the premises. We kids were not allowed inside, so we stood outside to catch a glimpse.” Tagore’s visit, he says, is part of the club’s cherished folklore: “We have only heard stories of when Tagore came to Lucknow in the 1920s. He was carried in a palanquin from Charbagh to AP Sen’s home, one of the club’s founders, where he stayed for a couple of days.”","Founded in 1914, the Lucknow Bengali Club is celebrating its 109th  Durga Puja anniversary, honoring Bengali traditions and maintaining deep-rooted community ties.

LUCKNOW The Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) has specified that it will not withdraw the property tax notices issued to the Uttar Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation (UPMRC). Ambi Bisht, the chief tax fixation officer of LMC, made this announcement on Thursday, emphasising that the LMC is fully entitled to collect taxes from UPMRC for the services it provides. Bisht pointed out that commercial establishments, such as pizza places and eateries, operate at several metro stations, profiting from their presence. However, these establishments have been reluctant to pay taxes, despite the fact that LMC is responsible for managing the waste generated by metro stations and their commercial enterprises. With 21 metro stations under their purview, LMC has served a notice to recover ₹7.57 crore in taxes from UPMRC, an amount that LMC believes is a reasonable contribution given the services provided. Additionally, LMC is preparing to issue another notice to UPMRC, this time regarding the taxation of advertisements displayed on poles without LMC’s consent. Bisht asserted that the revenue from advertising within the city should rightfully belong to LMC. Notably, it’s not just UPMRC that’s in LMC’s crosshairs. The Indian Railways has also received a property tax recovery notice amounting to ₹73 crore. Both UPMRC and the railways have been given a one-month ultimatum to settle their dues; otherwise, LMC will take more stringent actions against them.

Municipal commissioner Inderjeet Singh echoed LMC’s stance, emphasizing that the metro must pay property tax since there are no directives from the state government for tax exemptions in the case of the metro.

In response, an official from UPMRC argued that they are entitled to exemptions from state and local taxes, citing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) dated March 16, 2016, signed between the state, the Centre, and UPMRC. The MoU explicitly commits to exempting UPMRC from state and local taxes, duties, and levies, if any. The UPMRC official mentioned that they have presented their case to higher state government authorities, firmly believing that, with government support in accordance with the MoU’s provisions, they can ensure the profitability and long-term sustainability of the metro rail network in Uttar Pradesh, which remains an essential lifeline for the state’s urban population.

Furthermore, the outstanding loan of 450 million Euros from the European Investment Bank (EIB) underscores the critical importance of adhering to the MoU provisions for the financial well-being of UPMRC.","Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) stands by its decision not to withdraw property tax notifications issued to  Uttar Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation (UPMRC).

The agreement was reached during a meeting between the foreign ministers of the two countries in Islamabad.

The statement said that the two sides ""agreed to resume a comprehensive bilateral dialogue covering all issues of concern, including Jammu and Kashmir."" The dialogue is expected to begin in early 2024.

The resumption of dialogue is a significant development in India-Pakistan relations. The two countries have been nuclear-armed rivals since their independence in 1947, and they have fought three wars over Kashmir.

The decision to resume dialogue comes as both countries face a number of challenges, including economic instability and terrorism. The two countries have also been under international pressure to improve their relations and to resolve their outstanding disputes peacefully.

The resumption of dialogue is a positive step, and it is hoped that it will lead to a more peaceful and prosperous relationship between India and Pakistan.

Here are some of the specific issues that are likely to be discussed during the dialogue:

* **Kashmir:** Kashmir is the most contentious issue between India and Pakistan. Both countries claim the entire territory, and it has been a major source of tension and conflict for decades.
* **Terrorism:** India and Pakistan have both been victims of terrorism. The two sides have accused each other of supporting terrorist groups, and this has been a major obstacle to improving relations.
* **Trade:** India and Pakistan have a lot of potential for trade, but it has been limited by political tensions. The resumption of dialogue could lead to an increase in trade and economic cooperation between the two countries.
* **People-to-people ties:** There are many cultural and historical ties between India and Pakistan. The resumption of dialogue could lead to an increase in people-to-people exchanges, which would help to promote understanding and goodwill between the two peoples.

Indian Express,2016-09-30 00:00:00,INDIAN STRIKES,"India launched surgical strikes against suspected militants in Pakistani-administered Kashmir on Thursday night, in a major escalation of tensions between the two nuclear-armed rivals.

The Indian Army said that it had carried out the strikes ""on terrorist launch pads"" across the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border between India and Pakistan in Kashmir. The army said that the strikes had been successful and that it had inflicted ""significant casualties"" on the militants.

The Pakistani military denied that India had carried out any surgical strikes, and said that Indian troops had only fired across the LoC, killing two Pakistani soldiers.

The Indian Army's strikes come in the wake of the deadly attack on an Indian army camp at Uri in Jammu and Kashmir on September 18, in which 19 Indian soldiers were killed. India has blamed Pakistan for the Uri attack, and has demanded that Pakistan take action against the perpetrators.

Pakistan has denied any involvement in the Uri attack, and has accused India of trying to escalate tensions between the two countries.

The Indian Army's strikes are a significant development, as it is the first time that India has carried out a cross-border counter-terrorism operation since the Kargil War in 1999. The strikes are also a sign of India's growing frustration with Pakistan's continued support for terrorism in Kashmir.

The strikes are likely to further escalate tensions between India and Pakistan, and there is a risk that the situation could spiral out of control. It is important for both countries to exercise restraint and to avoid taking any further provocative actions.

Badal, who is the wife of Akali Dal patriarch Parkash Singh Badal, said that she could not continue in the government when it was bringing in laws that would harm the farmers of Punjab.

In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Badal said, ""I have resigned from the Union Cabinet in protest against the anti-farmer ordinances and the manner in which they were passed through Parliament.""

Badal's resignation is a major blow to the Modi government, as the Akali Dal is a key ally of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Punjab. The Akali Dal has been opposing the farm bills, saying that they will harm the interests of farmers.

The farm bills have been controversial since they were introduced by the government in June. The bills have been criticized by farmers' groups, opposition parties, and economists. However, the government has defended the bills, saying that they are necessary to reform the agricultural sector.

Badal's resignation is likely to put further pressure on the Modi government to reconsider the farm bills. The government is already facing protests from farmers in Punjab, Haryana, and other states.

The Hindu,1965-09-01 00:00:00,"""Pakistani Forces Attack Chhamb"" ","The headline ""Pakistani Forces Attack Chhamb"" in The Hindu on September 1, 1965, marked the beginning of the Second Indo-Pakistani War. The war was fought between India and Pakistan over the disputed territory of Kashmir.

**Background**

The Kashmir conflict is a territorial dispute between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir region, which has been the cause of two wars between the two countries. The region is primarily Muslim-majority, but it is also home to a significant Hindu minority.

The conflict began in 1947, when India and Pakistan gained independence from British rule. The princely state of Kashmir was given the option to join either India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir, Maharaja Hari Singh, was Hindu, but the majority of the population was Muslim. He initially declared Kashmir independent, but later decided to join India. This decision led to an armed rebellion by the Muslim population of Kashmir, who were supported by Pakistan.

The first Indo-Pakistani War broke out in 1947 and ended with a ceasefire in 1949. The ceasefire line that divides Kashmir into Indian-administered Kashmir and Pakistani-administered Kashmir is known as the Line of Control (LoC).

**The 1965 War**

The Second Indo-Pakistani War began on September 1, 1965, when Pakistani forces attacked Chhamb, a strategically important town in Jammu and Kashmir, located near the border with Pakistan. The Pakistani attack was seen as an attempt to cut off the road between Jammu and Srinagar, the capital of Jammu and Kashmir.

The Indian army responded quickly to the Pakistani attack. Indian forces were able to repel the Pakistani attack and secure Chhamb. However, the war continued for several weeks, with both sides suffering heavy casualties.

The war ended with the signing of the Tashkent Agreement on January 10, 1966. The Tashkent Agreement was a ceasefire agreement that restored the status quo ante bellum, meaning that both sides agreed to withdraw to their pre-war positions.

**Impact of the War**

The Second Indo-Pakistani War was a major turning point in the history of the two countries. It led to a significant increase in military spending and a deterioration in relations between India and Pakistan. The war also had a significant impact on the people of Kashmir, who continued to suffer from the conflict for many years to come.

**Conclusion**

The Second Indo-Pakistani War was a major conflict with a significant impact on the two countries and the people of Kashmir. The war led to a deterioration in relations between India and Pakistan, and it continues to have an impact on the region to this day.

Apart from the nine Test playing nations, minnows Scotland, Kenya and Bangladesh participated in the competition. The tournament was categorized into two groups of six. South Africans started as the favorites after their splendid form in 12 months prior to the World Cup. ","The first World Cup final held at Lord’s in 1975 lasted almost a full day, nearly 10 hours. This one was over shortly after it started. The final between Pakistan and Australia had the no-smell of contest to it, but to suggest it was fixed was absolutely absurd. 
At the beginning of the World Cup, Aussies looked strangely out of sorts losing to New Zealand and Pakistan. Thereafter, they went on to win seven successive matches.
When Australia had gone to Old Trafford earlier for their final group match, they were in severe danger of the earliest possible exit. In the last Super Six match, Australian journalists and officials had been making calls to check on airline seat availability, which would have been firmed up had Herschelle Gibbs not celebrated too soon and thrown away a catch offered by Steve Waugh. Waugh went on to make 120 off 110 balls with 10 fours and two sixes and chased 271.
In the semi-final four days later, as Damien Fleming prepared to bowl to Lance Klusener – the player of the tournament – with South Africa needing just one to win, there came the biggest laughable error in the World Cup history. Klusener and Allan Donald had a horrendous running mix-up, the match was tied, and Australia went through on net run-rate..
Australia’s improbable lurch into the final after winning those cliffhangers was in total contrast to their opponents’ confident march. The Pakistanis lost three successive games which did not matter, but returned to form in time to earn their place at Lord’s by blowing Zimbabwe and New Zealand away by huge margins.",Sports

However, this project will involve the felling of 122 trees. The project is associated with Chief Minister Shinde's initiatives.

The construction of twin tunnels under the national park is a significant infrastructure development in the Mumbai metropolitan region. It could potentially lead to improved connectivity and transportation options, benefiting the local population and the city's overall transportation network. However, the felling of trees is a point of concern, as it can have environmental and ecological implications, particularly in a protected area like SGNP.

Balancing infrastructure development with environmental conservation is a complex challenge faced by many urban areas. Projects like this often require careful planning and mitigation measures to minimize their impact on the environment and local ecosystems.

It's essential to stay updated on the progress of the project, the mitigation measures in place, and any protests or concerns from environmental and conservation groups to ensure that development occurs in a sustainable and responsible manner.",National News

The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has been a major driver of the country's space industry, and its success has opened up new opportunities for big and small firms alike.

ISRO's recent successes have included the launch of the Chandrayaan-2 lunar mission and the successful deployment of the Vikram-S rocket by Skyroot Aerospace, a private Indian space company.

These successes have attracted attention to India's space industry and made it more attractive to foreign investors and customers.

As a result, a number of large companies have announced plans to invest in India's space sector. For example, Boeing has announced plans to invest $1 billion in India's space industry over the next five years.

In addition, a number of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have also emerged in India's space sector. These SMEs are developing a wide range of products and services for the space industry, including satellites, launch vehicles, and ground support equipment.

The growth of India's space industry is good news for the country's economy. The space industry is a high-tech industry that creates high-paying jobs. It also has the potential to spin-off new technologies that can be used in other sectors of the economy.

The government of India is also supportive of the growth of the space industry. The government has announced a number of initiatives to promote the growth of the space sector, including the creation of a new space agency called IN-SPACe.

IN-SPACe is a nodal agency that will facilitate and promote private participation in India's space sector. It will also provide support to SMEs and startups in the space sector.

Indian Express,2001-05-21 00:00:00,"Upper Caste Indian Male more European, says study","
The study's findings are interesting and could have implications for our understanding of India's caste system. However, it is important to note that the study is just one study and that more research is needed to confirm the findings. It is also important to note that the study did not find that upper caste Indian males are directly descended from Europeans. Instead, the study found that upper caste Indian males have a higher frequency of certain genetic markers that are common in Europeans. This suggests that there was a significant influx of European male genes into India's upper castes during the last 10,000 years.

The study's findings could help to explain why upper caste Indians have certain physical features that are more common in Europeans, such as fair skin and light hair. The findings could also help to explain why upper caste Indians have been more successful in certain fields, such as business and politics. However, it is important to note that correlation does not equal causation. Just because upper caste Indians have a higher frequency of certain genetic markers that are common in Europeans does not mean that these genetic markers are responsible for their physical features or their success in certain fields.

It is also important to note that the caste system is a complex and multifaceted issue. There are many factors that contribute to the success of certain castes in India, including education, wealth, and social connections. It is unlikely that genetics is the only factor that contributes to the success of upper caste Indians.

More research is needed to understand the full implications of the study's findings. However, the study is a valuable contribution to our understanding of India's caste system.
","A study published in the journal Genome Research has found that upper caste Indian males are more genetically similar to Europeans than lower caste Indian males. The study's authors say that the findings suggest that there was a significant influx of European male genes into India's upper castes during the last 10,000 years.

The study analyzed the DNA of over 1,000 Indians from different castes. The researchers found that upper caste Indian males had a higher frequency of certain genetic markers that are common in Europeans than did lower caste Indian males.

The Sikkim Express,2022-08-24 00:00:00,"With the amendment Act, all escape routes blocked for defaulters: SBS","The Sikkim Bank of Sikkim (SBS) has welcomed the Sikkim Public Demands Recovery (Amendment) Bill 2022 being passed in the Sikkim Legislative Assembly on August 24, 2022. The amendment Act makes it more stringent for people who are defaulting in paying various government revenues and dues including debts taken from the SBS on time.

The SBS managing director, P.W. Bhutia, said that similar Acts are there in other states, but the Sikkim Public Demands Recovery Act of 2006 was brief and the area of coverage was limited. The amendment Act was passed to make the Act more stringent and in line with other states.

The amendment Act will be applicable in all the revenue sectors of the government for recovery of dues of electricity, water, taxes, and others. It will also be applicable to the SBS, which is a state undertaking.

The amendment Act is expected to help the SBS and the government to recover dues from defaulters more effectively. It will also send a strong message to defaulters that they will not be able to escape their responsibilities.

The amendment Act makes the following changes to the Sikkim Public Demands Recovery Act of 2006:

* It expands the definition of ""defaulter"" to include people who owe dues to the government or the SBS, even if the dues are not in the form of a loan.
* It gives the government and the SBS more powers to recover dues from defaulters, including the power to seize and sell defaulters' property.
* It makes it more difficult for defaulters to challenge the government's or the SBS's recovery efforts in court.

The amendment Act is a significant development for the Sikkim government and the SBS. It will help the government and the bank to recover dues from defaulters more effectively and efficiently. The amendment Act will also send a strong message to defaulters that they will not be able to escape their responsibilities.

The amendment Act is also important for the people of Sikkim. It will help to ensure that all citizens pay their dues on time, which will benefit the state as a whole.

**Here is an example of how the amendment Act could be used to recover dues from a defaulter:**

Suppose a person owes money to the SBS and is defaulting on their loan. The SBS could use the amendment Act to seize and sell the person's property to recover the debt. The person could not easily challenge the SBS's recovery efforts in court.

The amendment Act is a powerful tool that the government and the SBS can use to recover dues from defaulters. It is important to note that the amendment Act should be used fairly and responsibly. The government and the SBS should not use the amendment Act to harass or intimidate people who are unable to pay their dues.

The treasure room at the temple has not been unlocked for three decades.
On Wednesday (October 18), a BJP delegation led by former Odisha unit president Samir Mohanty met Puri royal scion and chairperson of Shree Jagannath Temple Managing Committee (SJTMC), Gajapati Dibyasingha Deb, demanding its opening.
This came two days after the Congress staged a show of strength in Puri and raised the issue of the Ratna Bhandar, among other matters.","The controversy surrounding the treasure room of the Jagannath Temple in Puri, Odisha, and its long-standing closure is a complex and sensitive issue. Several factors have contributed to the debate:
1. Tradition and Ritual: The Jagannath Temple is one of the holiest Hindu temples and houses the idols of Lord Jagannath, Lord Balabhadra, and Devi Subhadra. The treasure room, known as the ""Ratna Bhandar,"" is believed to contain valuable jewelry, ornaments, and other sacred items. Tradition and religious practices have led to the room being sealed for centuries, with access strictly controlled.
2. Security and Preservation: The decision to keep the treasure room locked is also based on concerns about security and preserving the temple's cultural heritage. Opening it could risk theft, damage, or mismanagement of these valuable assets.
3. Legal and Government Intervention: In recent years, there have been demands to open the treasure room, primarily driven by legal actions and public interest petitions. Some argue that the temple's assets should be audited, and their value should be put to public use.
4. Transparency and Accountability: Proponents of opening the treasure room argue that it's essential to ensure transparency and accountability in the management of temple assets and to assess their true value for cultural and religious purposes.
The decision to open the treasure room is complex, as it involves balancing religious and cultural practices, security concerns, legal aspects, and the demands for transparency and accountability. The issue has sparked debates and legal actions, and any decision on this matter must consider all these factors while respecting the temple's traditions and significance.",Religion and Spirituality

Two, it tries to bring in a three-camera system with a 50MP primary camera, 48MP ultra-wide and 32MP portrait camera. And finally, it tries to pack in a larger 4300mAh battery, much larger than any on a flip format phone so far.

The government on Monday rejected the Opposition’s demand in the Rajya Sabha to send the contentious Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2018, to a joint select committee for further scrutiny.

The House was adjourned after heated exchanges between the treasury and Opposition benches. The Bill to ban triple talaq will be taken up again on Wednesday, when the House meets after a break for New Year’s Day. The legislation was cleared by the Lok Sabha on Friday.

Uncertain numbers

The government is in an uncomfortable position, with at least three parties, including NDA ally Janata Dal (United), opposed to the legislation.

According to sources, 25 members — 13 from the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and six each from the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) and the JD(U) — may walk out or abstain if a vote is called. The AIADMK and the TRS have rarely voted against any government legislation.

Specific mandate

“India firmly believes in the critical role that developmental assistance can play in transforming human lives. India does not send its armed forces abroad except under the specific mandate of UN Peacekeeping Operations,” said a source speaking on condition of anonymity.

Mr. Trump had referred to his conversation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging that Indian contribution to Kabul be increased and diversified as humanitarian contribution was not enough. “I could give you an example where I get along very well with India and Prime Minister Modi.

In the brief moments of a rapid-fire hearing, Chief Justice Gogoi and Justice S.K. Kaul did not delve into the issue.

“This is the Ramjanmabhoomi case? Yes? Listen to the order now... ‘Further orders will be passed by the appropriate Bench on the 10th of January’. Please come on the 10th of January,” Chief Justice Gogoi told the advocates present before moving on to the next listed case.

Combination of judges

The Ayodhya appeals were previously heard by a combination of three judges. The whole of this week is devoted to hearing miscellaneous matters after the court re-opened post the winter vacations.

All the Benches are sitting in combinations of two judges this week. The court would continue to sit in two-judge combinations on miscellaneous days — Mondays and Fridays. This is one of the reforms introduced by Chief Justice Gogoi to deal with pendency.

The Ramjanmabhoomi title dispute has been posted for January 10, a Thursday, when there would be a three-judge combination Bench available.

On October 29 last year, a three-judge Bench, led by Chief Justice Gogoi, had ordered the Ayodhya appeals to be listed on January 4, 2019, before an appropriate Bench for fixing a date for hearing.

The new phase in the Ayodhya case began after the Supreme Court, in a majority judgment, on September 27 last declined the plea made by Islamic bodies and individuals to refer the question as to whether prayer in a mosque is an essential part of Islam to a seven-judge Constitution Bench.

The majority verdict, in its last paragraph, had further directed the Supreme Court to start hearing the pending from the week commencing October 29.

It was also found rather unusual for Justice Ashok Bhushan, a puisne judge on the previous Ayodhya Bench which delivered the September 27 verdict, to fix the date of hearing of the appeals as October 29.

The Hindu,2019-01-08 00:00:00,Centre plans 10% quota for the poor,"The Union Cabinet on Monday approved a Constitution Amendment Bill to provide 10% reservation to the economically backward sections in the general category, a senior government official said. The Bill will also cover those from the Muslim, Sikh, Christian, Buddhist and other minority communities. The quota will be over and above the existing 50% reservation to the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and the Other Backward Classes (OBC).

The decision, which comes ahead of the general election in April-May, was taken at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The specific details of the Bill were not available as there was no word from the government after the meeting. A press briefing scheduled for the evening was cancelled. The reservation is for those castes that now do not avail themselves of quota in any category.

Bill likely today

Vijay Sampla, Minister of State, Social Justice and Empowerment, told The Hindu that those who have an annual salary of less than Rs. 8 lakh per year and possess less than 5 acres of land will be able to avail themselves of reservation in educational institutions and jobs.

The government is likely to introduce the Bill in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, the last working day of the winter session. The sitting of the Rajya Sabha has been extended till January 9. Articles 15 and 16 of the Constitution will have to be amended for the implementation of the decision, the Minister said.

A nine-judge Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court had, in the Indira Sawhney case, capped reservation at 50%. The court had ruled on November 16, 1992, that “clause (4) of Article 16 of the Constitution speaks of adequate representation and not proportionate representation” and “relaxation can be done in extraordinary situations and while doing so, extreme caution has to be exercised and a special case made out.” According to the 2011 Census, the population of the country was 1.21 billion. The population of the Scheduled Castes was 201.4 million and that of the Scheduled Tribes stood at 104.3 million.

Reacting to the decision, the Congress said it agreed with the principle of helping the poor in getting access to education and jobs but questioned the Modi government’s intent.

‘Where are the jobs?’

At a press conference, Congress communication chief Randeep Surjewala asked why the decision was taken when there are only 100 days left for the next Lok Sabha election. “We are committed to giving opportunity, reservation and employment to the poor. But the youth of the country are asking basic questions to Modiji. Where are the job opportunities?” Mr. Surjewala said.","The Union Cabinet has greenlit a Constitution Amendment Bill, ushering in a 10% reservation for economically disadvantaged sections in the general category. This extension covers minorities like Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists, and others. The new quota is separate from the existing 50% allocation for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes. Eligibility requires an annual income below Rs. 8 lakh and land ownership under 5 acres. The Bill's introduction in the Lok Sabha is imminent. The move has sparked debates, with the Congress raising questions about timing, especially with the upcoming elections and a job market concern.",National News

The AIADMK staged a walkout vehemently opposing the government’s move, while some other political parties, including the DMK, the Left and the Aam Aadmi Party demanded that the Bill be sent to a Select Committee.

DMK member Kanimozhi had demanded that the Bill be sent to a Select Committee and also sought division on her motion. She got support from several members, including T.K. Rangarajan of the CPI (M) and CPI’s D. Raja. The motion was, however, defeated. The Bill was passed with a majority of 165 against seven votes.

Earlier, Congress leader Anand Sharma said provisions under Articles 15 and 16 of the Constitution were for the backward and weaker communities. Attempts were made twice to extend reservation beyond their scope, but the Supreme Court struck them down. He said it took the government four years and seven months to bring the Bill in the last session.

Mr. Sharma questioned the circumstances in which the proposed law had been brought, stating that the BJP had lost the recent Assembly elections in five States and that the party got an indication it was not headed in the “right direction.” Also questioning the economic criteria set for extending the quota, he said not many people would benefit from it, especially when the government had failed to create enough jobs.

Mr. Sharma asked the government to extend the parliamentary session further and bring in the Women’s Reservation Bill.

Kapil Sibal said there were three hurdles that the law would have to cross, stating that there was complete non-applicability of mind on the government’s part, its constitutionality and the implementation.

Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the reservation would be applicable to jobs in both Central and State governments, adding that the legislation gave powers to the States to determine the economic criteria for beneficiaries.","The Indian Parliament passed a Constitutional Amendment Bill providing 10% reservation in education and employment for economically weaker sections in the general category.

It doesn’t specify an exact date for when these obligations kick in.

Experts rue the lack of mandatory targets and the challenge of inadequate enforcement by cities. “While the NCAP is welcome, the government must strengthen compliance. We have seen enough plans, and the basic right to clean air can’t be left hanging due to lack of strong enforcement,” said Aarti Khosla, Director, Climate Trends, in a written statement.

It is not clear how the government arrived at a number to determine the PM reduction targets. According to a report by the Environment Ministry, Beijing achieved a 40% reduction in five years, Mexico City a 73% reduction over 25 years. “In Delhi, we have seen an 8% reduction in annual PM levels from 2016,” said an official in the Ministry who didn’t want to be identified. “However this is Delhi.

The Hindu,2019-01-18 00:00:00,Modi’s decision to buy 36 Rafales shot the price of each jet up by 41%,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision, announced out of the blue in Paris on April 10, 2015, to buy 36 Rafale fighter jets from France instead of the 126 asked for by the Indian Air Force for six squadrons pushed the price of each fully fitted, combat-ready aircraft up by 41.42%. It was the National Democratic Alliance government’s acceptance of the cost of €1.3 billion claimed for the ‘design and development’ of 13 India Specific Enhancements (ISE), and the distribution of this ‘non-recurring cost’ over 36 instead of 126 bare-bones aircraft, that was the major reason for the big increase in price.

The NDA government has refused to disclose even to a privileged committee of Parliament full information on the pricing of a Rafale aircraft, contending that its agreement with France on the ‘Exchange and Reciprocal Protection of Classified or Protected Information’ stands in the way of such disclosure. The French government, however, has made it clear that this inter-governmental agreement is there only “to protect the classified information provided by the partner, which could, in particular, impact the security and operational capabilities of the defence equipment.” The restriction clearly does not apply to the disclosure of pricing details. In fact, a scan of news media coverage reveals that there has been selective background briefing by military and civilian defence officials on technical and other supposedly sensitive details of the deal and that these briefings have helped answer some, but not all the critical questions being asked about the Rafale deal, chiefly on the pricing of these medium multi-role combat aircraft (MMRCA).

This article, based on information exclusively available to The Hindu , focusses on the interesting question of how and why the price per Rafale fighter jet of the F3-R standard, with practically the same configuration and capabilities, changed substantially over three points, in 2007, 2011, and 2016.

In 2007, five years before M/s Dassault Aviation was declared the L1 vendor, that is, the Lowest Bidder and the presumptive winner of the tender floated by the United Progressive Alliance government for the supply of 126 Rafales (18 flyaway plus 108 to be manufactured, under licence, in India by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited), the price quoted by the vendor for one flyaway bare-bones aircraft was €79.3 million. By 2011, the escalation cost factor had taken this per-aircraft price up to €100.85 million. In 2016, the 9% discount on the 2011 price obtained by the NDA government for the 36 Rafales it was buying from France through an Inter-Governmental Agreement brought this per-aircraft price down to €91.75 million.

But that is not even half the story. Dassault claimed a €1.4 billion cost for the ‘design and development’ of 13 India Specific Enhancements, that is, additional capabilities in the form of hardware as well as software that had been specified by the Indian Air Force all along, and this cost was negotiated down to €1.3 billion. What it meant was that the design and development cost, now distributed over 36 Rafale fighter jets, shot up from €11.11 million per aircraft in 2007 to €36.11 million when the deal was struck in 2016.","The analysis delves into the pricing shifts of Rafale fighter jets, revealing how costs per aircraft fluctuated. In 2007, a single flyaway unit was priced at €79.3 million. By 2011, due to escalation, this figure climbed to €100.85 million. In 2016, an Inter-Governmental Agreement yielded a 9% discount, reducing the price to €91.75 million. Additionally, Dassault asserted a €1.4 billion expense for India Specific Enhancements, eventually negotiated to €1.3 billion. Consequently, the development cost per aircraft surged from €11.11 million in 2007 to €36.11 million in 2016.",Politics

For those above the age of 80, the proposal is to increase the pension from Rs. 500 to Rs. 1,200 a month.

The Ministry has submitted the proposal, which would have an additional annual cost implication of Rs. 18,000 crore, to the Finance Ministry to be considered for inclusion in the interim Budget to be presented on February 1.

“The proposal is being scrutinised for the possibility of inclusion in the Budget speech,” said a senior official of the Rural Development Ministry, which administers the National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP).

If the proposal is announced, the Ministry will then move the Cabinet to approve the increase in pensions, said the official.

Separately, a study has been launched to consider doubling the number of people covered by the scheme, a promise originally made in last year’s Budget.

The Hindu,2019-01-25 00:00:00,TRAI firm on new DTH tariffs from February 1,"Even though only 40% customers have registered their channel choices under the new tariff guidelines that kick in from February 1, the Telecom Regulatory Authority Chairman R.S. Sharma on Thursday expressed confidence that service providers will be able get options from all their subscribers within a week.

“We are monitoring the customer choice collection progress on a day-to-day basis. We are very confident… While initially the take off was slow, it has now picked up and trends indicate that we will reach the target by January 31,” Mr Sharma told The Hindu .

No extension

He added that the regulator is unlikely to extend the February 1, 2019, deadline for implementation, as there have been no requests from stakeholders for an extension.

“We have been regularly meeting the stakeholders and everybody is on the same page. In fact some of the organisations — News Broadcasters Association (NBA), Indian broadcasting Foundation (IBF) and All India Digital Cable Federation (AIDCF) — have given us in writing that we should not extend the implementation deadline,” Mr Sharma said.

Mr Sharma stressed that the new regulation — which makes it mandatory for the service provider to offer every channel on a la carte basis, for the first time, will ensure, that customers pay only for the channels they watch and also know the price of the channel.

“This is the only transaction, where the customer or the purchaser is not given the products he/she wants to purchase. The customer is simply given a bundle of products and he/she doesn’t even know the price of these products. Is there any industry or any commercial transaction where this happens?” Mr Sharma said.

The TRAI Chairman said the move will not only bring down the number of litigations in the sector but also encourage people to invest in good quality content.

“Today 90% of the cases in TDSAT are of the broadcasting sector… [despite the fact] the revenue from the sector is quite small compared to the telecom sector. This framework will reduce litigations which happen because there is ambiguity in relationships,” he said.

Notice to Tata Sky

On Thursday TRAI issued a show cause notice to DTH operator Tata Sky for allegedly failing to provide its customers options to choose channels in compliance with the new tariff norms.

In a press release, the regulator said it has received “hundreds of complaints” stating that one of the DTH service provider is not providing options to its subscribers to exercise their choices and providing misleading information in regard to implementation of new framework.

Show cause notice sent

While the Authority did not name the DTH operator, a source said that a show cause notice was sent to Tata Sky and the operator has assured in writing that they will be complying with the new regulatory framework and will make options available for obtaining the consumers choice.

In an emailed response, Harit Nagpal, Managing Director and CEO, Tata Sky said, “Tata Sky has always been compliant to regulatory requirements. We have gone live with our modes of communication across the Tata Sky website, Tata Sky Mobile App and also equipped the dealers that subscribers can reach out to.”","The Telecom Regulatory Authority Chairman, R.S.

The Hindu,2023-10-21 00:00:00,"Did not violate diplomatic norms, India tells Canada","India did not violate the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations by asking 41 Canadian diplomats to be repatriated, the Ministry of External Affairs asserted on October 20, in response to Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly, who had accused India of violating diplomatic norms by seeking a reduction in the number of Canadian diplomats posted in India. 

Ms. Joly had earlier announced that due to the reduced number of officials, Canada was forced to stop in-person services at its consulates in Chandigarh, Mumbai, and Bengaluru. Such services will now be available only in the Canadian High Commission in Delhi.

Canada’s “interference”
“We have been engaged with the Canadian side on this over the last month in order to work out the details and modalities of its implementation. Our actions in implementing this parity are fully consistent with Article 11.1 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations,” the MEA said, in a statement.

Accusing the Canadian government of maintaining a much higher number of diplomats in India, the MEA said that the reduction was necessitated by Canada’s “continued interference” in India’s internal affairs. “We reject any attempt to portray the implementation of parity as a violation of international norms,” the statement said.

A source further informed that India’s decision to seek parity was not sudden and was conveyed to Canada around a month back, with the deadline of October 10 being extended till October 20 subsequently, in consultation with the Canadian side.

‘India’s actions unreasonable’
Earlier, the Canadian Foreign Minister confirmed that Ottawa had acknowledged India’s move to take away diplomatic immunities from 41 Canadian diplomats, along with 42 dependents who were stationed in Delhi. “A unilateral revocation of diplomatic privileges and immunities is contrary to international law, including the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations,” Ms. Joly told the Canadian media.","India asserted that it did not violate the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations by requesting 41 Canadian diplomats to be repatriated.

The Hindu,2019-01-31 00:00:00,‘S-400 deal a proof of India-Russia ties’,"The S-400 missile defence system, which India is acquiring from Russia in a multi-billion dollar deal, is a proof of the special nature of the partnership between the two countries, Nikolay R. Kudashev, the Russian Ambassador to India, says.

“This would be a valuable contribution to the security of the Indian air space and, this is also a proof of the special nature of the ties between India and Russia,” Mr. Kudashev said in an interview with The Hindu . The deal was on track, and the first batch of delivery was expected in 2020, he added.

Last year, India and Russia signed the $5.2-billion deal for the S-400 system despite pressure from the U.S. and threats of sanctions. The S-400 is a highly advanced surface-to-air missile defence system that can shoot down hostile jets and missiles.

Asked if American sanctions would create hurdles for the payment of the system, Mr. Kudashev said both India and Russia recently came together to develop a practical solution, involving banks of two sides and national currencies, to overcome this challenge. “So as far as the problem is concerned, it’s no more there. Rather, it is about building the experience, the habit of payments in national currencies.”

Asked if India’s growing ties with the U.S. were a matter of concern for Moscow, he said, “We trust each other.” “We feel that it is more or less natural for a country of India’s size, influence and power to develop normal ties with other states... And we know that your relationship with the U.S. would not be anti-Russian in nature.”

He said Indo-Russia relationship was a living formula for the rest of the world. “Our relationship is not into a straitjacket. Our relationship is a living formula enriching the two of us. We are making the multipolar world stronger.” Asked about Russia’s growing ties with Pakistan in recent years, the Ambassador said Russia’s partnership with India and its ties with Pakistan were incomparable. “Our relationship with India is a special strategic partnership. We share with India unique confidence... Our relationship with Islamabad is minuscule. The aim of our ties with Pakistan is very much similar to yours — we need a stable government, predictable, we need a government which fulfils its obligations, to fight terror, drugs and crime,” Mr. Kudashev said.

Kudankulam plant

He added that the Kudankulam nuclear power plant in Tamil Nadu was being developed successfully. “Block one and two are very much on. Three and four, construction activity started. For five and six, the legal issues are settled. We are looking for a second site — six more blocks. The Indian government should offer the site to us.”","The Russian Ambassador to India, Nikolay R.

The Hindu,2019-01-29 00:00:00,‘India can’t handle more big cats’,"While conservation efforts are aimed at increasing the tiger count in India, global experts and officials in the government suggest that India must also prepare for a new challenge — of reaching the limits of its management capacity.

Officially, India had 2,226 tigers as of 2014. An ongoing census is expected to reveal an update to these numbers. But Rajesh Gopal, head of the Global Tiger Forum, said that India’s current capacity to host tigers ranged from 2,500-3,000 tigers.

Moreover, said another official, 25-35% of India’s tigers now lived outside protected reserves.

With dwindling core forests as well as the shrinking of tiger corridors (strips of land that allow tigers to move unfettered across diverse habitat), officials said there were several challenges — alongside the traditional challenges of poaching and man-animal conflict — to India’s success at tiger conservation. Recent attempts at translocating tigers to unpopulated reserves, such as Satkosia in Orissa, have ended badly, with one of the tigers dying.

Mr. Gopal was speaking at a conference of representatives from a group of countries who’ve signed a declaration to double tiger numbers by 2022, organised by the National Tiger Conservation Authority. Barring China, all other tiger-range countries — Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, Russia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, India and Nepal — were part of the conference in New Delhi on Monday.

Another official, involved in the ongoing census said the report — expected to be made public in May — will also, for the first time, discuss challenges of having a thriving tiger population.

“Overall, given the low availability of prey in some reserves, this is the capacity that can be supported. However, there are vast tracts of potential tiger habitat that can be used to improve prey density, develop tiger corridors and therefore support a much larger population,” said Y. Jhala of the Wildlife Institute of India (WII).

Over 10,000 tigers

K. Ullas Karanth, director, Centre for Wildlife Studies, however, said, “I would estimate the potential carrying capacity for tigers in India at 10,000 to 15,000, not the 3,000 we already have. When tiger recovery efforts began 50 years ago we had about 2,000 tigers.. If after all this effort and expenditure, we are satisfied with just 3,000 tigers, it points at a serious management problem: needlessly huge amount of money is being dumped repeatedly on the same 25,000-30,000 sq. km area where tigers are already at saturation densities, while other areas with potential for future recovery are starved of key investments.”

Since 2006, the WII has been tasked with coordinating the tiger estimation exercise. The once-in-four-years exercise calculated, in 2006, that India had only 1,411 tigers. This rose to 1,706 in 2010 and 2,226 in 2014 on the back of improved conservation measures and new estimation methods.","India's tiger conservation faces a management capacity challenge. Officially, there were 2,226 tigers in 2014, but current capacity is 2,500-3,000. Additionally, 25-35% live outside reserves. Challenges include shrinking forests, corridors, poaching, and conflict.

The Hindu,2019-01-28 00:00:00,"‘Islam in India influenced by Sufism, Bhakti movement’","The puritanical Islamic doctrine of Wahhabism was incapable of taking roots in India because of diverse traditions in the Muslim community influenced by the country's composite culture, experts on Muslim culture said on Sunday.

The panel of experts analysed multiple interpretative traditions among Muslims in India and elsewhere as well as modern challenges before them at a discussion on “Islam: Multiple Histories” at the Jaipur Literary Festival here.

Sufism and the Bhakti movement have had an impact on the beliefs and thoughts of Muslims since the medieval period, the experts said, adding that Islam practised in India was “vastly different” from that in West Asian countries.

Current dilemmas

The speakers also focused on the issues faced by Muslims living in secular societies, dilemmas created by technological advancements and the challenge of finding a unitary voice for the entire community.

Congress leader and former External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid, historian Rana Safvi and Canada-based anthropologist Zulfikar Hirji, who teaches at York University, Toronto, were in conversation with American journalist and author Max Rodenbeck, who is at present the South Asia Bureau Chief with The Economist .

Mr. Khurshid said though the basic belief of Muslims was the same everywhere, its understanding, interpretations and conceptions were quite different. “In that sense, Wahhabism, which is very different from Sufi Islam, cannot find a place in our country,” he said, and added that Indian Muslims had already repudiated the two-nation theory of Mohammed Ali Jinnah.

The Congress leader said the doors of Ijtihad (independent interpretation) were not closed forever in Islam and there was a “great need” for its application in contemporary society to interpret the religion in the light of modern challenges.

Democratic dialogue

“We should work on it in a democratic way. Both the spiritual and political leaders should join efforts and guide the community,” he said.

Ms. Safvi said Sufism had a special place in India’s history, as Sufi mystics such as Nizamuddin Auliya and Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti would sit and discuss Islam and understood it as a service to the people. In the secular domain, no one could stop non-Muslims from speaking up for Muslims’ rights, she said.

Prof. Hirji made references to the book, “ Islam: An Illustrated Journey ”, co-authored by him and Farhad Daftari, while stating that Islamic violence was a “total rejection of Islamic values”.","Experts on Muslim culture discussed the inability of Wahhabism to take root in India due to the influence of the country's diverse Muslim traditions.

Yashika Singh from the KwaZulu-Natal Province said the Pietermaritzburg train incident depicted in the tableau “Mohan to Mahatma” touched many emotional chords. A steam-engine train was depicted with the first carriage signifying the 1893 incident at Pietermaritzburg, when Gandhi, a young barrister, was thrown off it in a racist outrage.

Connection with India

“I am a fourth-generation South African of Indian-origin, and I love my country, but we feel a sense of deep connection with India too. And, Gandhi and Mandela provide strong links. So, this tableau really moved us,” she said.

Ms. Singh, who lives in Estcourt and works in the media sector, said a group of Indian-origin journalists had come from different parts of South Africa to cover President Cyril Ramaphosa’s state visit.

Asked if they were travelling with the President, Johannesburg-based Fakir Hassen said, “No, this has been done separately.”

The Hindu,2019-01-23 00:00:00,ISRO’s first mission of 2019 to put military satellite Microsat-R in space,"Just before midnight on Thursday, Indian Space Research Organisation's first mission of 2019 will put into space a 740-kg military imaging satellite, Microsat-R.

ISRO has shied away from sharing details of the spacecraft or its uses as it does routinely each time during its missions; except to say the satellite would be placed within 15 minutes after take-off in a polar orbit 274 km away from Earth.

This is much lower than any of its civil Earth observation spacecraft, which fly pole to pole over the globe at between 400 km and 700 km.

According to information obtained from different sources Microsat-R and its payload come assembled from a handful of laboratories of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and is meant for military use. The satellite was “assembled outside and ISRO only interfaced it” with its own systems and the launch vehicle, just as it treats any customer satellite.

C-44 will be launched around 11.30 p.m. from the older First Launch Pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota.

For its part, ISRO is experimenting on two aspects of the vehicle. One is to reuse a waste stage. “For us, the excitement is about reusing the spent fourth stage [PS4] of the rocket as an orbiting platform for future experiments,” an official said. Kalamsat, a small student payload, will be the first to use PS4 as an orbital platform.

Amid the 28-hour countdown for the launch, ISRO Chairman K.Sivan said the PS4-Kalamsat experiment would be short-lived. It would start about 1.5 hours from take-off and last about 14 hours until Friday midday. Later experiments with PS4 will be improved gradually, he said.

For the third time in ISRO’s recent history, the mission team is slated to cut off and restart the PS4 engine twice over a flight lasting around 100 minutes.

ISRO’s pre-launch brochure said, “In PSLV-C44, the fourth stage (PS4) of the vehicle will be moved to higher circular orbit so as to establish an orbital platform for carrying out experiments.”

The other experiment with the launcher PSLV-C44 vehicle will be a new third variant having two strap-on boosters. Called the PSLV-DL, D standing for demonstration, it ranges between the older two variants.","The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is set to launch its first mission of 2019, placing a 740-kg military imaging satellite called Microsat-R into space.

Indians other than those in the two age brackets will not be able to use Aadhaar to travel to the two neighbouring countries, for which no visas are needed, clarified the communique issued recently.

Indian citizens going to Nepal and Bhutan don’t need a visa if they have a valid passport, a photo identity card issued by the government of India or an election ID card issued by the Election Commission, it added.

Earlier, persons over 65 and under 15 could show their PAN card, driving licence, Central Government Health Service (CGHS) card or ration card, but not the Aadhaar, to prove their identity and visit the two countries.

Giving details, the official said a certificate of registration issued by the Embassy of India, Kathmandu, to Indian nationals is not an acceptable travel document for travelling between India and Nepal. “However, the emergency certificate and identity certificate issued by the Indian Embassy in Nepal will be valid for single journey for travelling back to India,” he said, citing the communique.","Aadhaar cards are now recognized as valid travel documents for Indians below 15 and above 65 years old traveling to Nepal and Bhutan.

The Hindu,2019-01-20 00:00:00,‘Rafale debate an artificial storm’,"Union Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday said all questions pertaining to the deal to buy 36 Rafale fighter jets had been answered in detail both in Parliament and outside.

She then questioned if the intention of the debate, which she referred to as “artificial storm”, was to sabotage the deal or cancel the procurement.

On Thursday, The Hindu , published an exhaustive story on the huge price escalation in the deal for 36 jets compared to the earlier agreement for 126 jets which was scrapped.

Ms. Sitharaman said in all debates on defence procurements, there is fine line between transparency and national security. Stating that the Congress has not bought any jet, or even concluded the negotiations, Ms. Sitharaman said that when someone is trying to [buy the jets] there are attempts to question by pushing the strategic interests of the country.

Taking a dig at the Congress, Ms. Sitharaman said defence procurements are cumbersome but in the past the rigour has been “tweaked” for somebody who has not gone through the system or “corners have been cut.” “For good or bad, this government choose not to have middlemen at all. Not just in Rafale but in all deals… We have not had any middlemen in the corridors of South Block,” she stated.

Ms. Sitharaman said the deal was necessitated as adversaries in the neighbourhood were acquiring 4th generation and possibly 5th generation aircraft while the IAF was flying with older aircraft.","Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman stated that all questions regarding the Rafale fighter jet deal have been thoroughly addressed in Parliament and elsewhere. She questioned whether the ongoing debate was aimed at sabotaging or canceling the procurement.

She pointed out that the Congress had not finalized any jet purchase and accused attempts to question strategic interests when a procurement is underway.

“A separate Human Space Flight Centre has been formed in ISRO. The Gaganyaan project will come under it and that’s how we will target the first unmanned mission in December 2020,” Dr. Sivan said.

Responding to questions on the Chinese space programme, he said China had gone slightly ahead following its human space programme but, “Once Gagayaan is launched, we will be equal to them in all respects.”

Young scientist scheme

Stating that this year ISRO is planning to spread its wings in new areas, Dr. Sivan announced a Young Scientist Programme (YSP) and termed it their most important project to reach out to students.

Under the YSP, three students, 8th standard pass, would be selected from each of the 29 States and seven Union Territories and will spend one month at ISRO during which they will be given lectures, get access to research and development and will be given experience to build a satellite.

“If the satellite is good, we will launch it. This programme is similar to U.S. space agency NASA’s student outreach,” Dr. Sivan stated. This year ISRO has planned 32 missions, including 14 launch vehicles, 17 space craft and one demo.","ISRO's Chairman, Dr. K.

“Around 1.5 crore farmers will be brought on digital platform under this program, supported by Maharashtra Remote Application Centre (MRSAC) and ISRO. In its first stage, crop management, area under cultivation will be brought on digital platform in six districts in the rabi season. Satellite monitoring from sowing till harvesting of area under cultivation will be used to predict exact produce. It will be used to counter diseases on crops, including climate change. This will be the first project in the country under which farming will be digitally tracked,” Mr Fadnavis said at an interaction, through video conferencing, with farmers from across the State in a program called Lok Samvad.

Mr. Fadnavis reaffirmed his government’s commitment to doubling the income of farmers by 2022. “We are implementing various schemes of the central and state governments for farmers, and we are going to do it (double the income),” he said.

Amid allegations of private insurance companies, and not farmers, benefiting from the Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme, Mr. Fadnavis assured that farmers would benefit. He said that around 55 lakh farmers were given compensation worth thousands of crores under the scheme.

The Chief Minister said informed that the government has approved loan waiver worth ₹24,000 crore for the 51 lakh farmers holding bank accounts. “The government has also made available more than ₹10,000 crore fund in the budget for the current fiscal to implement various schemes meant for them,” he said, adding that the government distributed compensation worth ₹15,240 crore to farmers whose crops were hit by natural calamities.

Mr. Fadnavis also told the farmers that under the Jalyukta Shivar water conservation scheme, 16,000 villages across the State had become water-sufficient.","Maharashtra's Chief Minister, Devendra Fadnavis, launched the 'Maha Agritech' project, utilizing satellite and drone technology to digitally monitor various aspects of farming from sowing to harvesting.

The Hindu,2019-01-13 00:00:00,"Digital e-Choupal set to turn aggregator, offer more services","e-Choupal, the two-decade old initiative from ITC aimed to web-enable farmers to overcome challenges related to information access and procurement, is set for a major makeover this year.

Driven by increasing smartphone penetration in the country, coupled with declining data costs, the FMCG and hospitality conglomerate plans to launch a mobile version of the programme by middle of 2019.

“We are now working on a new model for expansion of the e-Choupal network following lower bandwidth costs and increasing smartphone penetration. The new model, which we are calling e-Choupal 4.0, will be rolled out in the next couple of months… the desktop-based e-Choupal will become a mobile-assisted service with a very different cost structure,” S. Sivakumar, who heads the Agri and IT Businesses at ITC said.

Declining costs

Mr. Sivakumar, under whose leadership the e-Choupal initiative was developed and executed, noted that when the programme was started 20 years ago, each e-Choupal cost around Rs. 30 lakh; this subsequently came down to just about Rs. 1.5 lakh as computers and technology became more affordable. The initiative now comprises about 6,100 installations covering over 35,000 villages in 21 States and serving over four million farmers across the country.

Under the current system, ITC helps build village internet kiosks. These kiosks enable farmers access information in their local language on the weather and market prices, besides knowledge on scientific farm practices and risk management.

With real-time information, farmers are able to align their farm output with market demand. The system also helps reduce transaction costs by eliminating the need for intermediaries as farmers are virtually linked to the mandi (agricultural market) system for price discovery. ITC, in turn, benefits from the lower net cost of procurement by eliminating costs in the supply chain that do not add value.

Bouquet of services

In its fourth generation, the e-Choupal will assume the role of an ‘Aggregator of Agricultural Services’ and offer a bouquet of farm focussed services in areas, including crop management, farm mechanisation, healthcare, banking and insurance.

The prototype is being tested in select catchments and will be expanded depending on sourcing needs for new agricultural products. The mobile application has been developed by ITC Infotech, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ITC Limited.

As part of the e-Choupal initiative forward, ITC has also launched a programme — ‘ Baareh mahine hariyali’ — focussed on helping farmers multiply their incomes by maximising farm utilisation over 12 months of the year. The programme has been implemented in four districts of Uttar Pradesh including Allahabad, Chandauli and Ghazipur, and Bihar’s Munger district.

Under it, the company has helped farmers adopt new high-yielding varieties of wheat, introduced short-duration paddy to enable timely sowing of wheat in the rabi season and practices such as zero-till sowing which have led to cost saving, timely sowing and minimisation of environmental pollution. In Uttar Pradesh, the pilot project has reached out to nearly 2,00,000 farmers.

Asked about the increase in farmers’ income due to the e-Choupal initiative, Mr. Sivakumar said, “It is a complicated subject… the incomes of farmers have multiplied manifold — that is evident when you speak with them, but what part of it is attributable to which initiative is always a question mark… Much of this can also be attributed to improvement in road and irrigation facilities. The idea is that when we get some competitive vibrancy into these economies it has a spiralling effect that triggers many other things.”

“What the programme has done, however, is that one, it has brought in a sense of possibility and employment to the farmers. Secondly, it has brought competitiveness even in the mandi system — this has also been acknowledged in many government reports as well. Therefore, at a very macro level, this is what is being done,” he said.","ITC's e-Choupal initiative, empowering farmers with information and procurement aid, undergoes a transformation. Fueled by smartphone usage and lower data costs, e-Choupal 4.0, a mobile-assisted version, will launch in mid-2019. The initiative has evolved over two decades, covering 6,100 installations in 35,000 villages across 21 states, serving four million farmers. The new e-Choupal expands services to include crop management, mechanization, healthcare, banking, and insurance.

The Hindu,2019-01-12 00:00:00,"Cycling helps user, economy: study","Cycling for short distance trips can yield an annual benefit of Rs. 1.8 trillion to the economy, and cycling regularly for an average distance of 3.5 km for just 120 days can help avoid 4,756 premature deaths, says an analysis by The Energy Resources Institute (Teri).

Even though cycle sales have risen only 1% in a decade — as opposed to a 9% rise in cars and two-wheelers — cyclists in cities constitute nearly 40% of those who travel more than 21 km for work. That’s around the same as those who commute a similar distance by car, says findings from the 2011 Census, which were used in the study to analyse cycling trends in India.

“A significant number of people may be compelled to bicycle to work because they can’t afford alternatives,” said Megha Kumar, one of the researchers involved in the study. More than half of India uses “non-motorised” forms of transport, such as walking and cycling, to travel to work, followed by two-wheelers (18%) and buses (16%), the report notes.

Substituting just half the short distance work trips, which are typically undertaken by two-wheelers and cars, with cycles, could result in massive savings — about Rs. 27 billion from fuel expenditure and 0.35 Million Tonnes of Oil Equivalent (MTOE) in terms of energy, the researchers calculated.

The report, which was funded by the All India Cycle Manufacturers Association, said the government should reduce Goods and Services Tax (GST) on cycles that cost less than Rs. 5,000; promote manufacturing of bicycles, and “discourage” personal motorised vehicles through congestion charges, increased cost of parking, and a “pollution tax.”","Cycling for short trips could lead to an annual economic benefit of Rs. 1.8 trillion and help avoid 4,756 premature deaths if done regularly, according to a study by The Energy Resources Institute (Teri).

Most trade unions, however, vehemently opposed the proposed amendments, saying the government was trying to interfere in, and cripple, their functioning.

Ten Central trade unions had earlier written to the Labour Ministry objecting to the draft version of the amendment Bill; the only major standout was the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.

“This is a dilution of the Trade Unions Act,” said Tapan Sen, general secretary of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), affiliated to the Communist Party of India (Marxist).

He said the amendments were politically motivated, and would only give power to the government itself.

“We have opposed the interference of the government in the recognition of trade unions,” said Amarjeet Kaur, general secretary of the CPI-affiliated All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), pointing out that there were already established procedures in place to verify the Central and State unions.

India can take some solace from their match against Australia in the sense that they pushed the hosts a lot closer.

It was quite a positive for the Indian team, reeling under the inconsistency shown by their attack in the preceding Test series. They missed the mediumpacer in the first three Tests and when he returned in Sydney, he was way off-colour, down on pace and lacking in match fitness.

The Hindu,2019-01-03 00:00:00,China building ‘advanced’ warships for Pak.,"It is a version of its most advanced guided missile frigate.China is building the first of four “most advanced” naval warships for Pakistan as part of a major bilateral arms deal to ensure among other things “balance of power” in the strategic Indian Ocean, the state media reported.

Equipped with modern detection and weapon systems, it will be capable of anti-ship, anti-submarine and air-defence operations, China Daily quoted state-owned defence contractor China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) as saying.

The under-construction ship is a version of the Chinese Navy’s most advanced guided missile frigate, it said.

CSSC did not specify the ship’s type but said it is being constructed at its Hudong-Zhonghua shipyard in Shanghai.

China, an “all-weather ally” of Islamabad, is the largest supplier of weapon system to Pakistan. Both countries also jointly manufacturing the JF-Thunder, a single engine multi-role combat aircraft.

The ship’s class is reported to be Type 054AP, which means it is based on the Type 054A of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Navy, the report quoted the Pakistani Navy as saying.

The Pakistani Navy previously said four such ships had been ordered, according to the report.

‘Balance of power’

Once constructed, the warship “will be one of the largest and technologically advanced platforms of the Pakistani Navy and strengthen the country’s capability to respond to future challenges, maintain peace and stability and the balance of power in the Indian Ocean region,” the report said.

It will also support the Pakistan Navy’s initiative of securing sea lanes for international shipping by patrolling distant waters, the daily quoted CSSC as saying.

The report said Type 054A is the best frigate in service with the PLA Navy. Military sources said the ship has a fully loaded displacement of about 4,000 metric tonnes and is equipped with advanced radars and missiles. About 30 Type 054As are in service with the PLA Navy.

An insider in China’s shipbuilding sector with knowledge of the Type 054AP programme told theDailythat the ship is the largest and most powerful combat vessel China has ever exported.

“Based on pictures circulating on the Internet, the ship will have vertical launch cells that can fire Chinese HQ-16 air-defence missiles and other kinds of missiles,” he said.","China is constructing the first of four advanced naval warships for Pakistan in a bilateral arms deal aimed at maintaining a ""balance of power"" in the Indian Ocean.

The Hindu,2019-01-03 00:00:00,Religion vs religious nationalism,"The starting point for anti-Hindutva politics must be the distinction between Hinduism and Hindutva. Else, it’s doomed.Any rigid secular approach, unrestrained by considerations of electoral politics, could only lead to disapproval of Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s demonstration of his religious faith and his characterisation of the Congress as a “party of Hinduism”. His approach has been widely termed “soft Hindutva”, and as an attempt to compete with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in its game. Those who deride Hindutva and those who swear by it both consider Mr. Gandhi a poor imitator of it. Centrist politics by definition is vulnerable to criticism from radical perspectives of different hues — for instance, Marxist M.N. Roy, Dalit leader B.R. Ambedkar and Hindutva proponent, and later his assassin, Nathuram Godse, were all critical of Mahatma Gandhi’s ideas of Hinduism. What is worth a closer analysis in the current context is the suggestion that the invocation of Hindu symbols for electoral gains is Hindutva, albeit a softer version.

A clear trajectory

Mainstream Indian nationalism and Hindu nationalism shared a range of symbols and personalities during their formative decades, and distinguishing one from the other can appear a challenging task often. Consolidation of the Hindu society was a preoccupation of several reformists and leaders of the struggle for independence, who were not linked to Hindutva. In a classic essay written in the 1990s, at the peak of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, historian Sumit Sarkar marked the stages of the evolution of Hindu nationalism in two distinct phases: first from the use of the word Hindu as a geographical marker to ‘Hinduism’, an attempt to codify the cultural and religious practices, and then to Hindutva. Swami Vivekananda was the seer of the first shift. “Of the Swami’s address before the Parliament of Religions, it may be said that when he began to speak it was of the religious ideas of the Hindus but when he ended, Hinduism had been created,” wrote Sister Nivedita, the Swami’s closest disciple. Three decades later Veer Savarkar, who invented Hindutva, did not merely seek to unify Hindus, but tried to achieve it by imagining the other as those who do not consider India their sacred land. While secular nationalism’s adversarial image was imperialism, the edge in Savarkar’s Hindutva was against Muslims and Christians. Vivekananda’s Hinduism had no enemy figure.

The political rise of Hindutva has been directly proportionate to the success of its proponents’ attempts to equate itself with Hinduism.

The Gandhi-Nehru way

For Gandhi, Hinduism was the essence of his existence, but even the avowedly secular Jawaharlal Nehru was not dismissive of faith and tradition. The Discovery of India draws from sacred texts and beliefs; “though I have discarded much of past tradition and custom… yet I do not wish to cut myself off from that past completely,” he wrote in his will, asking for some of his ashes to be immersed in the Ganga.

The vertical rise and the horizontal spread of Hindutva challenge its opponents to devise new political idioms. A puritan view is that Hindutva can be challenged only with an unyielding secular paradigm, devoid of Hindu symbols. Those leaders and parties that are directly involved in electoral politics are more conflicted on these questions than those who have the convenience of a quarantined approach. In the early 2000s, when critics began to use the neologism saffronisation to describe the A.B. Vajpayee government’s policies that advanced Hindutva, within the Congress there was a debate on the wisdom of it. A.K. Antony and Digvijay Singh vehemently opposed the expression, arguing that it amounted to legitimising the Hindutva agenda given the cultural association of the colour saffron with sacrifice and renunciation. The Congress discontinued use of the word.

Other parties too have used Hindu symbolism and terminology. Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Lalu Prasad, whose mastery of electoral politics broke the Hindutva momentum in Bihar, connects his community to Lord Krishna. “Haathi nahin Ganesh hai, Brahma Vishnu Mahesh hai (this is not merely an elephant, but is Lord Ganesh; and Brahma Vishnu Mahesh)” was the Bahujan Samaj Party’s 2005 slogan referencing its election symbol, the elephant. Groups associated with the Communists Party of India (Marxist) in Kerala recently organised events around Ramayana month. “The Sangh has created a particulate image of Ram, that a majority of the faithful do not relate to,” said V. Sivadasan, CPI(M) State committee member, who was closely associated with the programme. “Given this context, it is the duty of the secularists to come in support of the believers who understand Ram different from the way the RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) tries to make him. All secular people have this responsibility to help protect the plurality of faith that exists among religious people.”

Whether or not these attempts add up to a robust and credible challenge to Hindutva is an open question. However, the notion of ‘soft Hindutva’ is detrimental to anti-Hindutva polemics and mobilisation.

For one, it ignores the tactical components of electoral politics, which the moralist might dismiss as opportunism, for good reasons. What is more critical is that the notion of expressive faith as ‘soft Hindutva’ is an inadvertent endorsement of the Hindutva claim that it is equivalent to Hinduism. The proponents of Hindutva also acknowledge the existence of ‘hard’ and ‘fringe’ elements within its fold. Categories of soft and hard, being relative terms, trick moderates and offer an alibi to opportunists to side with the softer versions — Vajpayee against L.K. Advani, Mr. Advani against Narendra Modi, and who knows, perhaps Mr. Modi against Yogi Adityanath in the future?

Any equivalence between Hinduism and Hindutva, conversely, is taken to mean that any criticism of Hindutva is an attack on Hinduism. That one could be accused of being anti-Hinduism for questioning the logic of building a temple on the site of a destroyed mosque at Ayodhya draws from the logical premise of likening Hinduism to Hindutva. To take another example, the Hindu American Foundation claimed recently that even the questioning of ‘Brahminical patriarchy’ is a an act of Hindu-phobia.

To Hindutva’s advantage?

And most consequentially, any polemical negation of the wall between Hinduism and Hindutva makes the transition from the first to the second easier. It could even encourage believers to consider Hindutva their natural political abode, if they sense hostility in the anti-Hindutva camp. If non-Hindutva platforms expect temple-goers to explain their conduct, that is not an enticing recruitment pitch. The fact is that there are numerous people who visit temples and even believe in vastu, astrology, tantra, etc. while still being secular in a political and public context.

The only politics that benefits from associating Hinduism to Hindutva is Hindutva. The practice of Hinduism, even when it is exhibitionist and for political ends, is not Hindutva — soft or hard. Hindutva stands out for its conceptual clarity, leaving little scope for a spectrum within it. A manifesto for any durable anti-Hindutva politics is still a long way away, but its singular starting point is an assertion of the distinction between Hinduism and Hindutva. Anything else is doomed.","The article stresses the need to differentiate between Hinduism and Hindutva in anti-Hindutva politics. It warns against embracing ""soft Hindutva"" and argues that equating Hinduism with Hindutva inadvertently bolsters the latter's influence. The author contends that blurring this distinction may facilitate individuals moving from one to the other. In conclusion, the article emphasizes that a clear separation between Hinduism and Hindutva is essential for an effective anti-Hindutva stance.",Opinion and Editorial
The Hindu,2019-01-03 00:00:00,Deterrence or danger?,"India does not gain anything by escalating the nuclear arms race in the region with INS Arihant.The indigenous nuclear submarine, INS Arihant ( picture ), is a great achievement for India. The Indian Navy, its engineers and scientists have done us immensely proud. But it might not be inappropriate to ask: Will Arihant make us more secure, and if so, in what way?

It has been universally recognised that the sole justification for having nuclear weapons is their deterrence value. If ever a nuclear bomb has to be used, it has destroyed its raison d’être. The initiation of a nuclear attack would mean utter destruction, not just for the two parties involved but also for regions far beyond. The Americans got away with their bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, however controversial it was, because they had a monopoly of nukes at the time. Today, the situation is vastly different and far more dangerous. If nuclear weapons fail to deter the outbreak of war involving use of such weapons, they have disastrously failed in their deterrence mission.

A nuclear triad

The major nuclear weapon powers, principally the U.S., have developed the myth of a nuclear triad, that consists of land-based, air-based and sea-based nuclear delivery systems. The theory is that if country A initiates a nuclear attack on country B in a first strike, country B must be in a position, even after absorbing the nuclear strike, to retaliate with a massive nuclear attack on the enemy country. This is called second strike capability. In the event that country A manages to destroy the land and air-based nukes of country B, country B will still have its third leg in the shape of sea-based nuclear-tipped missiles, called SLBMs or submarine-launched ballistic missiles, for use against country A because the sea-based missiles, launched from nuclear-powered submarines, would have remained undetected and hence safe from enemy attack. Thus, the rationale for the naval leg of the triad is its survivability. Essentially, the argument in favour of the naval leg is not that it makes the deterrent more credible, but that, as mentioned above, it will survive for retaliation.

In the event that an enemy initiates a nuclear strike, it will never be able to destroy all the land and air-based nuclear weapons of the target country. Again, the enemy might attack population centres and not nuclear weapon sites; in that case, all the nukes of the target country would be available for retaliation. In either case, the deterrence capability of the target country would remain intact. If the possession of the naval leg were to deter the enemy, ab initio, from initiating a nuclear launch, it would add to the deterrence value. Survivability by itself does not appear to make deterrence more credible.

If the hostilities reach the threshold where a country may consider using nuclear weapons, it would be preceded by a period of conventional warfare. The enemy would also have to reach the conclusion that unless he uses his nuclear weapons, he would suffer a defeat that he simply cannot afford to let happen. A conventional conflict itself will not start before several days of negotiations, including possible mediation by external powers and the UN Security Council. Even a small incident involving India and Pakistan would immediately invite big powers to rush in and mediate pull-back of forces, etc. Whether the external interventions succeed or not in preventing a major war, the target country would have ample time to disperse its land and air-based nuclear assets. The naval leg does not seem indispensable.

The case of Pakistan

Let us take Pakistan. One does not know if it has a nuclear doctrine, but even if it does not have one, that by itself does not make it an irresponsible nuclear power. Pakistan has rejected the no-first-use policy and has in fact said that it would not rule out using nukes if it felt compelled to do so in a war. It claims to have so-called tactical nuclear weapons which can presumably be used in a battle field. Pakistan, in other words, keeps the option of using nuclear weapons first as a deterrent against a conventional attack by India. India’s stand is clear. Any use of nuclear weapon, tactical or otherwise, will invite massive retaliation by India which would have disastrous consequences for Pakistan. (Will India remain unaffected by radiation, etc? Can we guarantee that the winds will not blow in our direction? The radiation, debris, heat, blast, etc will be carried well beyond the belligerents’ borders.) So, even assuming that we will have the political and moral will to unleash the full force of our nukes, how does acquiring SSBNs or a nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine make our deterrent more credible?

Since Pakistan is still a long way away from having the naval leg of the triad, would not our land and air-based nukes be enough of a deterrent? Is it conceivable that after destroying each other’s land and air-based nuclear platforms, either country will have even the need to bring into play its naval leg? And, if and when Pakistan does acquire the third leg, which it is bound to sooner or later, even if it has to ‘eat grass’, will it then make the nuclear equation more stable and make each country’s deterrent more credible? We may not admit it, but we are engaged in a nuclear, and conventional, arms race, exactly the same way the superpowers were during the Cold War era.

China is far ahead of India in many respects. It has more warheads and more nuclear-powered submarines. Both India and China have repeatedly declared adherence to the no-first-use doctrine. So where is the justification for acquiring the naval leg of the triad? We have a territorial dispute with China, but both countries have acquired enough experience to manage and contain the conflict. It is reasonably safe to say that there will not be an all-out war involving the use of nuclear weapons between India and China.

One of the arguments in the 1960s and 1970s in favour of atom bombs was that they would be cheaper in the long run. That has not happened. The acquisition of expensive conventional platforms as well as the ever expanding nuclear programme has destroyed that argument. India has been in the forefront in campaign for nuclear disarmament. Let us not at least escalate a nuclear arms race in our region.

Chinmaya R. Gharekhan, a former Indian Ambassador to the United Nations, was Special Envoy for West Asia in the Manmohan Singh government","The article questions the need for India's nuclear submarine, INS Arihant, in enhancing national security. It argues that the primary purpose of nuclear weapons is deterrence and initiating a nuclear attack undermines this purpose due to the devastating consequences. The concept of a nuclear triad, comprising land-based, air-based, and sea-based systems, is discussed, with emphasis on the survivability of the naval leg. The author contends that in scenarios where nuclear weapons might be considered, there would be time for dispersal of assets. Given India's situation with Pakistan, the article questions the necessity of acquiring the naval leg. It further suggests that China's nuclear capabilities and commitment to a no-first-use doctrine challenge India's pursuit of this path.",Opinion and Editorial
The Hindu,2019-01-03 00:00:00,Powering South Asian integration,"The new electricity guidelines are a first step towards creating a true regional marketOn December 18, the Union Ministry of Power issued a seemingly anodyne memo that set the rules for the flow of electricity across South Asian borders. Evaluated against the turbulent politics around the issue, the new guidelines are a startling departure from India’s previous stance. In an atmosphere of regional intrigue and mistrust, it is a rare and recent example of political pragmatism. It is important not only because it leads South Asian electricity trade in progressive directions but is also a concession to India’s neighbours in an area of political and economic importance.

A course correction

The revision is a response to two years of intense backroom pressure from neighbours, particularly Bhutan and Nepal, to drop trade barriers put up in 2016. The new guidelines meet most of their demands, that were timed to coincide with the recent visit of Bhutan’s new Prime Minister. India has thus signalled that it is serious about working with neighbours on the issues that should undergird 21st century South Asian regionalism, such as electricity trade.

This course correction is a return to a trajectory of incremental, hard-earned progress developed over the decades. Ideas of tying South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries together with cross-border energy flows — that punctuated the early 2000s — began to gain steam with substantial power trade agreements between India and Bhutan (2006) and Bangladesh (2010). These were driven by India’s need for affordable power to fuel quickened growth in a recently liberalised economy.

The apotheosis came in 2014 with the signing of the SAARC Framework Agreement for Energy Cooperation and the India-Nepal Power Trade Agreement in quick succession. The new government in New Delhi was keen on regional cooperation, and these agreements imposed few restrictions on trade. Instead, they laid the contours of an institutional structure that would allow private sector participation and facilitate market rationality in electricity commerce. At the Fifth SAARC Energy Ministers’ meeting that year, Power Minister Piyush Goyal said he dreamt of ‘a seamless SAARC power grid within the next few years’ and offshore wind projects ‘set up in Sri Lanka’s coastal borders to power Pakistan or Nepal’. Yet, two years later, the Union Ministry of Power released guidelines that imposed a slew of major restrictions on who could engage in cross-border electricity trade.

There was a strong undercurrent of defensiveness in the guidelines of 2016. They seemed to be a reaction to perceptions of increased Chinese investment and influence in the energy sectors of South Asian neighbours.

Some irritants

The guidelines prevented anyone other than Indian generators in the neighbouring country, or generators owned by that country’s government, from selling power to India. Excluded were scores of privately held companies, particularly in Nepal, that had hoped to trade with India. In restricting access to the vast Indian market, the economic rationale for Nepali hydropower built for export was lost. Bhutan was worried about a clause that required the exporting generation companies to be majority owned by an Indian entity. This created friction in joint ventures between India and Bhutan. Bhutan also fretted about limited access to India’s main electricity spot markets, where it would have been well placed to profit from evening peaks in demand. Bangladesh had sensed an opportunity to partially address its power crisis with imports from Bhutan and Nepal routed through Indian territory but the guidelines complicated this by giving India disproportionate control over such trade.

After two years of protests from neighbours, the new guidelines resolve all these issues and restore the governance of electricity trade to a less restrictive tone. Earlier concerns that India was enabling the incursion of foreign influence into neighbouring power sectors seem to have been replaced by an understanding that India’s buyer’s monopoly in the region actually give it ultimate leverage. More broadly, India seems to have acknowledged that the sinews of economic interdependency created by such arrangements have the political benefit of positioning India as a stable development partner rather than one inclined to defensive realpolitik.

Tool for a greener grid

A liberal trading regime is in India’s national interest. As India transitions to a power grid dominated by renewables, regional trade could prove useful in maintaining grid stability. Major commitments to renewables, which could amount to half of India’s installed power within a decade, have prompted justifiable concerns about stabilising the grid when the sun goes down or in seasons when renewables are less potent. Harnessing a wider pool of generation sources, particularly hydropower from the Himalayas that ramps up instantly as India turns on its lights and appliances after sunset, could be an important instrument in achieving a greener grid. Nepal and Bhutan have long recognised that their prosperity is tied to the sustainable use of vast hydropower reserves.

The new guidelines are a tentative first step towards the creation of a true regional market in which generators across the subcontinent compete to deliver low-cost, green energy to consumers. Since this would soften the hard borders of South Asia, it is essentially a political vision. The new guidelines are a significant step in this direction because, for the first time, they allow tripartite trading arrangements, where power generated in a country is routed over the territory of a neighbour to be consumed in a third. This is a crucial move towards the evolution of complex, multi-country market arrangements. Such markets require the construction of regional institutions that absorb the politics and manage the technicalities of electricity trade.

At present, this function is managed by the Indian state because of its geographic centrality and the ready availability of institutions that manage its domestic power sector. As volumes increase and experience in regional trade grows, South Asian nations might feel the need to build joint, independent regional institutions that proffer clear and stable rules of the road. The political vision to create this — felt in the new guidelines — must be maintained.

Aditya Valiathan Pillai is Senior Researcher at the Initiative on Climate, Energy and Environment, Centre for Policy Research","India's recent electricity guidelines signal a notable departure from previous policy, facilitating increased cross-border electricity flow in South Asia. This shift, in response to pressure from neighboring countries like Bhutan and Nepal, aligns with India's regionalism goals and cross-border energy initiatives. It also holds potential benefits for grid stability during India's transition to renewables. The guidelines mark a step towards a genuine regional market. As volumes grow, joint regional institutions may be needed to manage trade rules effectively. The political vision for this should be sustained.",Opinion and Editorial
The Hindu,2019-01-03 00:00:00,Lessons from Kerala ,"Its experience could help achieve the objectives ofthe Astana Declaration on primary care
Last year, in October at Astana, Kazakhstan, world leaders declared their commitment to ‘Primary Care’. They were reaffirming what their predecessors had done in Alma Ata in 1978. The Alma Ata Declaration, as it was called, had been criticised as wishful thinking without a clear road map on strategies and financing — an allegation that could be levelled against the present declaration too.

In 2016, Kerala had, as part of the Aardram mission to transform health care, attempted to re-design its primary care to address the current and future epidemiological situation. Lessons learnt from Kerala’s experience could provide insights into what needs to be done to ensure the objectives of the Astana Declaration do not remain a statement of pious intentions in India.

The Astana Declaration would “aim to meet all people’s health needs across the life course through comprehensive preventive, promotive, curative, rehabilitative services and palliative care”. A representative list of primary care services are provided: “including but not limited to vaccination; screenings; prevention, control and management of non-communicable and communicable diseases; care and services that promote, maintain and improve maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health; and mental health and sexual and reproductive health”.

The Kerala experience

In the revamped primary care, Kerala tried to provide these services and more with mixed results. These services cannot be provided without adequate human resources. It is nearly impossible to provide them with the current Indian norm of one primary care team for a population of 30,000. Kerala tried to reduce the target population to 10,000. Even the reduced target turned out to be too high to be effective. Kerala’s experience suggests that providing comprehensive primary care would require at least one team for 5,000 populations. This would mean a six-fold increase in cost of manpower alone. Since supply of more human resources would generate demand for services, there would be a corresponding increase in the cost of drugs, consumables, equipment and space. So a commitment to provide comprehensive primary care — even in the limited sense in which it is understood in India — would be meaningful only if there is also a commitment to substantially increase the allocation of funds. It is sobering to remember that most successful primary care interventions allocate not more than 2,500 beneficiaries per team.

Providing the entire set of services, even if limited to diagnosis and referral, is beyond the capacity of medical and nursing graduates without specialised training. Practitioners in most good primary care systems are specialists, often with postgraduate training. The Post Graduate Course in Family Medicine, which is the nearest India has to such a course, is available in very few institutions. If the services are to be provided by mid-level service providers, as is planned in many States, building their capacity will be even more of a challenge. It would be a long time for this to be built. Kerala has tried to get over this through short courses in specific areas such as management of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and depression.

The primary care system will be effective only when the providers assume responsibility for the health of the population assigned to them and the population trusts them for their health needs. Both are linked to capacity, attitude and support from referral networks and the systemic framework. It will not be possible unless the numbers assigned are within manageable proportions. Access to longitudinal data on individuals through dynamic electronic health records and decision support through analysis of data will be helpful in achieving the link.

Discussion on primary care in India focusses only on the public sector while more than 60% of care is provided by the private sector. The private sector provides primary care in most countries though it is paid for from the budget or insurance. The private sector can provide good quality primary care if there are systems to finance care and if the private sector is prepared to invest in developing the needed capacities. Devising and operating such a system (more fund management than insurance though it can be linked to insurance) will be a major challenge but a necessary one if good quality primary care is to be available to the entire population. Negotiations to set up such systems in Kerala are only at the initial stage.

Achieving Universal Health Coverage — one of the Sustainable Development Goals to which India is committed — is not possible without universal primary health care. The experience of Kerala in transforming primary care reveals the steepness of the path India will have to cover to reach the goals committed to in the Astana Declaration.","The article discusses the commitment to ""Primary Care"" declared in the Astana Declaration, comparing it to the Alma Ata Declaration from 1978. It emphasizes the need for comprehensive primary care services and highlights Kerala's attempt to redesign its primary care system. The author suggests that providing such services would require a significant increase in manpower and funding. Specialized training for medical practitioners and the role of the private sector in primary care are also mentioned. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of universal primary health care in achieving Universal Health Coverage, a Sustainable Development Goal for India.",Health and Wellness
The Hindu,2019-01-03 00:00:00,All along the coastline,"Breaking down the new Coastal Regulation Zone NotificationWhat changes will the notification bring?

The Cabinet has approved a significant relaxation of development controls along the coastline through the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification 2018, as part of a plan to encourage construction of buildings and launch tourism activities in areas that are closer to the high tide line. State governments and others had made representations, calling for a review of coastal management policies. Recommendations for changes were then made by the Shailesh Nayak Committee.

The Centre has taken the view that both affordable housing availability and tourism will grow if restrictions on coastal zones are relaxed. With this objective, a decision has been taken to permit current Floor Space Index (FSI) or Floor Area Ratio (FAR) in urban areas coming under CRZ-II — which governs the size of buildings — as on the date of the new notification. This does away with the restrictions on construction which date back to the Development Control Rules of 1991. The CRZ-II urban category, as per the CRZ notification of 2011, pertains to areas “that have been developed up to or close to the shoreline”, and are legally designated municipal limits already provided with roads, water supply, sewerage connections and so on.

What about rural areas?

For rural areas, the newly approved notification adds a sub-category to CRZ-III. The new provision, CRZ-III A, applies development restrictions to a much smaller area of 50 metres from the high tide line, compared to the 200 metres that was earmarked as the no development zone (NDZ) earlier for densely populated areas. These are defined as places with a population of 2,161 per sq km as per the 2011 Census. Areas with a population density below that will continue to have 200 metres as the NDZ.

However, for tourism expansion, the new scheme will allow temporary facilities such as shacks, toilet blocks and changing rooms, maintaining only a slim margin of 10 metres from the high tide line.

The system of granting clearances has also been changed. States will have the authority to approve proposals for urban (CRZ-II) and rural (CRZ-III) areas. The Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change will grant clearances for ecologically sensitive areas (CRZ-I), and areas falling between the low tide line and 12 nautical miles seaward. The modifications also include demarcation of a 20-metre no development zone for all islands and guidelines to deal with sensitive areas.

What will be the likely impact?

When the draft of the new CRZ notification was published in 2018, concerns were raised that it ignored two major issues: maintaining a well demarcated hazard line and factoring in the effects of climate change on sea levels. The disastrous impacts of periodic cyclones show that coastlines will become even more vulnerable.

Protection of fishers poses a challenge, since the relaxation of development controls could subject them to severe commercial pressures. The decision to allow construction andtourist facilities closer to the coast may boost employment and grow local business, but without strong environmental safeguards, these could damage fragile ecosystems.","The Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification 2018 relaxes development controls along coastlines to encourage construction and tourism. Changes include permitting current Floor Space Index (FSI) or Floor Area Ratio (FAR) in urban CRZ-II areas, removing 1991 restrictions. In rural areas, CRZ-III A imposes smaller development limits of 50 meters from the high tide line, compared to the previous 200 meters. States gain authority for approvals, and the Ministry of Environment will oversee ecologically sensitive zones. Concerns persist about hazard lines, climate change impacts, commercial pressures on fishers, and potential environmental damage without strong safeguards.",Environment
The Hindu,2019-01-03 00:00:00,Caught in a crossfire?,"Spats over detention of Canadians in China reflect the scale of the U.S.-China trade war
The diplomatic row between Beijing and Ottawa over the detention and treatment of Canadian nationals in China continues to escalate, to the detriment of bilateral relations. But more serious could be the implications of the standoff for the ongoing trade war between China and the U.S. The spat goes back to the detention on December 1 of a top Chinese telecom executive in Vancouver, who has since been released on bail, in response to a U.S. request. Washington wanted custody of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei and the daughter of the company’s founder. Her arrest was part of the U.S. Justice Department’s ongoing criminal probe into the company’s sale of telecommunications equipment to Iran, a potential breach of sanctions against Tehran. But the arrest is also seen in the context of the caution in much of the West against Huawei’s potentially winning bids as 5G communication networks are adopted, on grounds of a security threat. The military background of the Huawei founder has only raised speculation about the firm’s connection to the Chinese defence and intelligence services. Conversely, the U.S. has invoked a rare national security provision under domestic law to impose punitive tariffs on global steel and aluminium imports. A similar investigation is under way specifically to determine the risk to domestic security from alleged Chinese intellectual property abuses. In addition, Beijing’s “Made in China 2025” industrial policy has aroused deep suspicion in the U.S. about the persistence of state subsidies to prop up indigenous firms. It is therefore speculated that Washington has its lens trained on Huawei, which has emerged as the world’s largest telecommunications equipment maker, surpassing Sweden’s Ericsson.

Meanwhile, there is concern that Canadian residents in China may face retribution for Ms. Meng’s detention. A Chinese court last week ruled as too lenient the 15-year sentence against a Canadian convicted of drug-related offences. A former diplomat who was arrested has apparently been denied legal representation, although Canadian embassy officials were permitted to visit him. Another Canadian was detained for alleged transgressions of national security. Given the climate of mistrust between the U.S. and China, it is hard to dispel the perception that Canada has got caught in the crossfire. In fact, the Canadian Foreign Minister has suggested that President Donald Trump should desist from using the episode as a bargaining chip in trade disputes with China. But it is conceivable that Chinese trade concessions to de-escalate tensions could pave the way for a resolution of the standoff over Huawei. That would likely satisfy the hawks in Washington who fear that the U.S. is ceding its technological dominance to China.","The diplomatic conflict between China and Canada regarding detained Canadians reflects the broader impact of the U.S.-China trade war. The dispute stems from the arrest of a top Chinese executive at Huawei, Meng Wanzhou, in response to a U.S. request, raising concerns about Huawei's role in 5G networks. The U.S. has also imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and is investigating Chinese intellectual property abuses. Canada may face repercussions, but a resolution may be possible through Chinese trade concessions. This could address U.S. concerns about technological dominance.",International News
The Hindu,2019-01-03 00:00:00,GST shortfall,"As the tax collections remain below target,it may be time to recalibrate expectationsRevenue collections from the Goods and Services Tax (GST) are going too far off the mark for comfort. Inflows declined for the second consecutive month in December to Rs. 94,726 crore from Rs. 97,637 crore in November and Rs. 1,00,710 crore in the month before. Between April and December, GST collections have averaged about Rs. 96,800 crore, and have not even once met the monthly target of Rs. 1,06,300 crore, going by the Union Budget math for 2018-19. Now in order to achieve the year-end target, GST collections over the next three months will have to reach an average of Rs. 1,34,900 crore. But given the spate of tax rate cuts announced by the GST Council in December that kick in this month and Prime Minister Narendra Modi hinting at further rationalisation of rates for construction materials soon, the pressure on revenues is likely to persist. Separately, as the government looks to woo traders and small businesses back to its electoral fold, the Council is considering a relaxation in the GST norms for micro, small and medium enterprises by raising the annual sales threshold for compulsory GST registration from Rs. 20 lakh to over Rs. 50 lakh. Such a relaxation, along with regulatory steps like greater forbearance for small business loans, will boost sentiment among such firms, but it will further dent the tax kitty. Other revenue heads, including direct tax or disinvestment receipts (even via innovatively structured intra-public-sector deals), are unlikely to be adequate to plug the GST shortfall.

This poses a challenge for the Centre at a time when it would have been hoping to announce some populist measures ahead of elections, while retaining its macro-economic management credentials. States’ revenue collections under the GST regime have been uneven and a GST Council panel is examining inter-State variations. But the Centre is bound to compensate States for revenue shortfalls for the first five years of the GST regime. Unless the Centre decides to drop its fiscal deficit goals, a squeeze on spending, including planned capital expenditure, may be the only option. There is a more problematic aspect to the dip in GST collections, based on economic activity and compliance trends in November. The total number of returns filed that month hit a high of 72 lakh from 55 lakh at the beginning of the fiscal, yet revenues fell. November also marked the onset of India’s festive season, with a late Deepavali. Yet, the higher compliance and the festive fervour translated into collections lower than the average monthly receipts for the year till date. Though India’s growth fell to 7.1% in the second quarter of this fiscal, an uptick in private investment over the same period was considered a sign of revival. But if consumers are not confident enough to spend, a consumption-led investment revival to take the economy to an 8% growth path seems elusive again.","India's GST revenue collections have consistently fallen below the target, averaging Rs. 96,800 crore between April and December, far from the monthly goal of Rs. 1,06,300 crore. Achieving the year-end target of Rs. 1,34,900 crore in the next three months is challenging, given recent tax cuts and potential further rationalization. There's a proposal to relax GST norms for micro, small, and medium enterprises, which could boost sentiment but decrease tax income. This presents a challenge for the government, especially in light of upcoming elections. State-level GST collections vary, and the Centre must compensate for shortfalls in the first five years. Without adjusting fiscal deficit goals, spending cuts, including planned capital expenditure, may be necessary. Despite higher compliance in November and increased private investment, consumer confidence in spending remains a concern for achieving higher economic growth.",Business and Finance

The Indian economy is projected to be the fastest-growing major economy in the current year and upcoming fiscal 2019-20, the Finance Ministry said on Wednesday, while emphasising that the government has taken several steps to boost investors’ confidence.

The average growth of the economy between 2014-15 and 2017-18 was 7.3%, the fastest among major economies in the world, the Ministry said in its Year End Review 2018.

“Indian economy is projected to be the fastest-growing major economy in 2018-19 and 2019-20 [International Monetary Fund October 2018 database]. This is borne [out] by GDP growth of 7.6% in the first half of 2018-19,” it said.

The economy is on track to maintain a high growth rate in the current global environment, it added.

Highlighting various initiatives taken to improve investor confidence and boost growth, it said there were measures to spur manufacturing, comprehensive reforms in foreign direct investment policy, special package for the textile industry, push to infrastructure development by giving infrastructure status to affordable housing and focus on coastal connectivity.

The direct tax-to-GDP ratio of 5.98% achieved during 2017-18 fiscal is the best in the last 10 years, the Ministry added.

It further said there was a growth of over 80% in the number of tax returns filed in the last four financial years from 3.79 crore in 2013-14 to 6.85 crore in 2017-18.","The Finance Ministry stated that the Indian economy is expected to be the fastest-growing major economy in the current and upcoming fiscal years.

The Hindu,2019-01-03 00:00:00,RBI ‘eyes’ solution to read denominations,"Mulls tech to help visually challenged.In a bid to help the visually challenged, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is scouting for a digital solution that can identify and read out the denomination of Indian currency notes to users.

Coming in the backdrop of issuance of new currency notes, the plan is aimed at developing or authenticating a technology-based solution to achieve the task in a few seconds, according to a source familiar with the development. The solution could be a device, software or a combination of both, to help not just the visually challenged, but also those who cannot read in poor lighting, the source said.

Following up on an announcement in June, the RBI recently called for an expression of interest (EoI) from entities for a mechanism or device that can detect and read out the denomination. The reason behind the RBI scouting for such solutions is because of the blurring of physical dimensions of the notes that thus far served as the main differentiator.

In other words, unlike in the past, the size of the note need not be indicative of denomination. There are also certain Intaglio (raised) printing-based identification marks in currency notes of Rs. 100 and above. The RBI is “sensitive to the challenges faced by visually challenged in conducting their day-to-day business with Indian banknotes,” the statement in June said.

Noting that technological progress had opened up new vistas for making banknotes more recognisable for the visually challenged, the bank had announced its decision to explore the feasibility of developing a suitable device or mechanism for aiding them in the identification.

As on March 31, 2018, about 102 billion pieces of banknotes were in circulation, having a value of Rs. 18 trillion. This comprised Rs. 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 2000 notes, including the new series being issued since November 2016. The new Rs. 20 note is expected to be released soon.

Apart from inviting EoIs, the RBI has formed a panel to go into different aspects, including solutions in practice abroad, which include an app used in the U.S. and a credit card-sized solution in a few other countries.","The RBI is seeking a digital solution to help the visually impaired identify Indian currency notes.

The Hindu,2019-01-04 00:00:00,"Light Combat Aircraft Tejas gets the green light for manufacture in enhanced, battle standard format","FOC tag signals that the indigenous fighter is fully equipped and fit for battle; delivery of first aircraft expected in Oct.-Nov. 2019On December 31, Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas quietly progressed towards manufacture in an enhanced, battle standard format.

A new ‘limited’ clearance from Centre for Military Airworthiness & Certification (CEMILAC), a laboratory of the Defence Research and Development Organisation, for the fighter aircraft green-lights its production in a superior lethal version, multiple sources associated with the LCA programme confirmed.

Hindustan Aeronautics Limted (HAL), which is mandated to produce the LCA for the Indian Air Force (IAF), aims to get the first aircraft out in late 2019 in the just-cleared standard, its Chairman and Managing Director R. Madhavan said.

“We have received drawings and documents related to this standard. We can now start activities such as planning, procurement of parts from vendors. We aim to deliver the first aircraft [in the cleared standard] in October or November 2019,” he said.

‘Tight lead time’
“The lead time has become tight for us. As for the remaining aircraft, we must see how many of the 16 we can deliver by the middle of 2020,” Mr. Madhavan said.

The LCA is being designed and developed by the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) in Bengaluru. The IAF has asked HAL to make 40 LCA. Of this, 20 will be in the advanced ‘FOC’ (final operational clearance) format. The remaining 20 are in the earlier IOC (initial operational clearance) version.

The FOC tag signals that the novice LCA is fully equipped and fit for battle. It adds many features over the IOC version, which Tejas achieved in December 2013. The IOC enabled the IAF to start flying it and in getting acquainted with its competences. Until then, only test pilots and the ADA handled Tejas.

'Good development for HAL'
“The latest clearance is a good development for HAL. My jigs were getting empty and we didn’t have anything to do after making the IOC standard LCAs. We start now,” Mr. Madhavan said.

Tejas was expected to be FOC-compliant much earlier, the last two deadlines being June-end and December-end of 2018.

More than one source said what was given on December 31 is an interim or limited FOC; Tejas is still some distance away from being FOC standard. And that this was done to speed up production and keep HAL’s idling facilities engaged. Further improvements would follow in the ‘FOC-2’ phase.

A higher-up in the defence set-up also confirmed the move: “It is ‘almost-full’ FOC. Very few additions [are there that] can be added later,” the person said.

To get the final of FOC certification, the plane must have battle-time requirements — such as mid-air refuelling, AESA radar, electronic warfare suites, a variety of bombs and weapons, among others. It has passed mid-air refuelling and armament testing, while the full picture was not immediately available.

The IAF has modified and upgraded its trainer requirement in its old package order of 40 LCA.

It has opted to have all eight trainers in the FOC mode, instead of four each in the IOC and FOC standards.

Of the 16 fighters in the IOC version, 11 had been delivered, one is being flight-tested and four are being assembled, he said.","The Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas, designed by the Aeronautical Development Agency, has received a new clearance for enhanced battle-standard production.

The Hindu,2019-01-04 00:00:00,Dissent note on Citizenship Bill,"‘Against basic fibre of Indian society’Members of four Opposition parties — the Congress, the Trinamool Congress, the Samajwadi Party and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) — have moved a dissent note against the report of the joint committee on Citizenship Amendment Bill 2016.

The Bill proposes to give citizenship to six persecuted minorities — Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, Parsis, Christians and Buddhists — from Pakistan. The Opposition members have been demanding that the Bill should be made “religion and country neutral.” The members from Assam have also been opposing it because it would pave the way for giving citizenship, mostly to illegal Hindu migrants from Bangladesh in Assam who came after March 1971, in violation of the agreement of the Assam Accord, 1985.

In a stormy meeting on Thursday, the Opposition members demanded more time for deliberations but chairman and BJP MP Rajendra Agarwal rejected the demands. The committee has cleared the Bill, according to sources, without any major cuts in its original structure.

The Bill, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said, is against the very basic fibre of the Indian society. “We stand for secularism and the Bill is just against the most basic value of our society,” he said. Three dissent notes are expected from Congress alone.

Samajwadi Party MP Javed Ali also gave in his dissent note. Speaking to The Hindu he said, “The Bill is ill-intentioned. It has been brought about by the BJP to showcase that India is a Hindu Rashtra.”

The committee chairman said that notwithstanding the dissent notes, the report will be tabled on January 7.","Members from four opposition parties (Congress, Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party, and CPI(M)) have submitted a dissent note against the Citizenship Amendment Bill 2016.

The Hindu,2019-01-04 00:00:00,Judges’ retirement age won’t go up,"Law Ministry responds to a proposal from the parliamentary panelThe Law Ministry on Thursday said there was no proposal as of now to increase the retirement age of Supreme Court judges from 65 to 67 and of High Court judges from 62 to 65.

The Ministry was responding to the recommendation of a Parliamentary Standing Committee that raising the retirement age of judges would help retain the existing judges, which in turn would help in reducing both vacancy and pendency of cases in short run.

In August 2010, then Union Law Minister M. Veerappa Moily introduced the Constitution (114th Amendment) Bill, 2010 in the Lok Sabha.

The Bill, which sought to increase the retirement age of High Court judges to 65, could not be taken up for consideration in Parliament and lapsed with the dissolution of the 15th Lok Sabha.

Panel’s concern

The committee, in its report tabled in Parliament on Thursday, raised concern over the large number of vacancies of judges in High Courts.

The Ministry countered that the appointment of judges in the Supreme Court and High Courts is a continuous and collaborative process of the Judiciary and Executive.

“While every effort is made to fill vacancies expeditiously, vacancies keep on arising on account of retirement, resignation or elevation of judges and increase in judge strength,” the Ministry said.

It further stated that the time line for initiation of the proposals for filling up of vacancies is rarely adhered to by the High Courts.

As of now, out of a total approved strength of 1,079 judges in 24 High Courts across the country, only 695 posts are filled.

The committee headed by BJP lawmaker Bhupender Yadav was of the view that to reduce pendency of cases, the existing vacancy positions of judges need to be filled up immediately.

As per the existing memorandum of procedure (MoP), the judge appointment proposal has to be initiated by the Chief Justice of the High Court six months before the occurrence of vacancy. Within six weeks, the Chief Minister/Governor has to recommend on the proposal received from the Chief Justice.

And within four weeks, the Chief Justice of India/SC Collegium has to recommend the proposal to the Law Ministry","The Law Ministry clarified that there's no current proposal to increase the retirement age for Supreme Court judges (from 65 to 67) or High Court judges (from 62 to 65).
