Thirtyseven pilgrims, including women and children standing on rail tracks, were killed when a speeding express train ploughed into them today in Bihar's Khagaria district, triggering angry protests by locals who attacked train drivers, set ablaze a coach and vandalised the station.

‘Kanwarias’ or devotees of Lord Shiva were walking along the tracks at Dhamara Ghat station after alighting from the Samastipur-Saharsa passenger when the Saharsa-Patna Rajyarani Express travelling at 80 kmph, ran over them, a senior railway official said. Khagaria is about 160 km from Patna.

Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said that 37 persons, including women and children, were killed. Among them were 13 women, four children and 20 men. The victims hailed from Khagaria, Sahrsa, Munger and Naughachia. Twentyfour others, who sustained injuries, were admitted to the hospital here.

Soon after the incident at 8.40 am, a violent mob assaulted the train driver, set on fire an AC compartment and engine of another train, vandalised the station and even held a few rail staff hostage.

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the Chief Minister appealed for calm.

Railway Board Chairman Arunendra Kumar said the express was not supposed to halt at Dhamara Ghat and was given clearance to pass through, but the pilgrims on the tracks thought they could stop the train.

Though the driver applied the emergency brakes, it was too late by then, he said, adding an internal inquiry has been ordered into the accident. The pilgrims were going to nearby Katyani Sthan temple to offer ‘jalabhishek’ to Lord Shiva on the fourth and final Monday of the holy month of Shrawan.

Superintendent of Police S K Jha said the engine of the Samastipur-Saharsa passenger train and an AC coach of Saharsa-Patna Rajyarani Express were set on fire by enraged local people.

The two drivers of the express train, Rajaram Paswan and Sushil Kumar Suman, fled from the spot after being attacked. They later contacted railway officials to informing them that they were safe, ECR CPRO Amitabh Prabhakar said.

The Prime Minister “appealed for calm in the area so that the relief and rescue operations can be carried out without any hindrance,” a statement by PMO said.

The Prime Minister has directed the Railway Ministry to deploy all available resources for rescue and relief operations, it said.

Minister of state for Railways Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the express was travelling at a speed of 80 km per hour when the accident occurred.","On August 19, 2013, a devastating train accident occurred at Dhamara Ghat station in Khagaria, Bihar, killing 37 pilgrims—including women and children—and injuring 24 others. The victims, devotees of Lord Shiva known as Kanwarias, had just disembarked from a passenger train and were walking along the tracks toward a nearby temple when the Saharsa-Patna Rajyarani Express, traveling at 80 km/h, ran over them. The express train was not scheduled to stop at the station. In the aftermath, enraged locals attacked train staff, set fire to coaches, and vandalized the station. The train drivers fled after being assaulted. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar appealed for calm and directed full deployment of rescue resources. An internal inquiry was ordered by the Railway Board to investigate the incident. The tragedy underscored serious safety lapses and the vulnerability of pilgrims during religious travel.

The return of Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla from the International Space Station is more than a triumphant homecoming ~ it is a bold punctuation mark in the story of India’s space ambitions.

For a country that sent its first man to space over four decades ago, the latest mission signals a new chapter: one not of borrowed seats and symbolic gestures, but of capability-building, international collaboration, and deep investment in the future of human spaceflight. Group Captain Shukla’s 22-hour return journey from the ISS, following an extended stay aboard as part of a four-member international team, marked the completion of India’s most meaningful manned space participation to date. It was not merely a ride-along. Backed by India’s space agency and involving seven Indian-designed experiments, this mission was a live test-bed for the skills, systems, and scientific acumen that will be crucial for the Gaganyaan human spaceflight programme scheduled for 2027. Yet beyond the technical significance lies the symbolic value.

Group Captain Shukla’s statements from orbit reflect an India increasingly self-assured in space. By calling today’s India “ambitious, fearless, confident, and pro – ud,” he articulated what many Indians feel but rarely see reflected so vividly on the world stage. Space has al – w ays held out the promise of prestige, but now it is being pursued with purpose. His presence aboard the ISS wasn’t just about national pride ~ it was also a reaffirmation of India’s place in the league of technologically advanced nations. In an era where space is becoming the next strategic frontier, India’s participation signals a quiet assertion of equal stakes and serious intent.

The Rs 500 crore investment that enabled this mission was not a ceremonial expenditure. It bought India not only a seat on a private space mission, but a front-row experience in orbital operations, multinational coordination, and real-time space research. These are the building blocks of any credible human spaceflight programme ~ and ISRO’s decision to gain first-hand exposure through a commercial channel is a pragmatic strategy for rapid learning. Crucially, the mission also underscores the val – ue of public-private partnerships in a domain traditionally dominated by national agencies. The collaboration with global players ~ whether in the form of training, launch services, or on-board experiments ~ reflects a changing space eco system in which India must engage not as a client, but as a stakeholder.

The Gaganyaan mission and India’s plans for a space station by 2035 and a Moon mission by 2040 will increasingly rely on such integrative approaches. This mission has already achie – ved something remarkable: it has reignited public imagination. It has reminded India’s youth ~ and its policymakers ~ that space is not distant anymore. It is within reach. The experience and momentum gained from this voyage must now be channelled into building robust infrastructure, training next-generation astronauts, and expanding India’s global role in space science. As Group Captain Shukla said before leaving the ISS, the journey is just beginning. And for India, the stars are no longer symbolic ~ they are strategic.
","Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla’s return from the International Space Station marks a major milestone in India’s space journey, shifting from symbolic participation to strategic capability-building. Unlike previous missions, this effort was driven by India’s own investment and included seven Indian-designed experiments, providing vital experience for ISRO’s upcoming Gaganyaan human spaceflight mission in 2027. Shukla’s presence aboard the ISS showcased India’s growing confidence and ambition in space exploration. The ₹500 crore mission was not ceremonial—it offered real-world exposure to orbital operations and international collaboration. This success highlights India’s transition from a participant to a stakeholder in global space exploration, reinforcing its plans for a space station by 2035 and a Moon mission by 2040.

The Janata Dal-United, a key constituent of the National Democratic Alliance, today gave an indication of its opposition to Narendra Modi's projection as possible prime ministerial candidate by raking up the 2002 Gujarat riots and criticising the Chief Minister for his “failure to check communal violence.”

While unwilling to offer any comment on what would be the party’s stand in case Modi is projected as the PM nominee, the JD-U, one of the oldest NDA ally, said: “One does not bargain with or pressurise friends.”

However, responding to persistent questions at a briefing on deliberations of the party meet here, JD-U secretary general KC Tyagi said the party will do nothing to jeopardise its hoary secular credentials reminding how the Janata Dal sacrificed the VP Singh government in 1989 by taking into custody BJP leaders on the Ram Janmabhoomi issue.

As for the ‘Modi as PM chant’, Tyagi said as of now there was nothing in the form of a resolution by the BJP or its Parliamentary Board spelling out its stand on the issue. “Show us any resolution…being popular is one thing and being PM is another,” Tyagi asserted.

He, however, was categorical that as far as the JD-U was concerned, its leader Nitish Kumar was not a claimant for the top political post in the country.

In an obvious retort to the BJP that declared Modi as secular, Tyagi said as the head of the government in Gujarat during 2002 “he failed to act with alertness and as a liberal leader,” making it clear that the JD-U does not approve of the manner in which the situation was handled.

Amid indications that the party will ask the BJP to declare the PM candidate early, final contours of the political direction is expected to emerge at the National Council meeting tomorrow that would be addressed both by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and party president Sharad Yadav, who was re-elected to the post for the third time in a row.

That the relations between the JD-U and the BJP were not smooth in several states was indicated by Tyagi who said party chiefs from the UP, Karnataka, Jharkhand and Rajasthan talked at length about various issues.

","The Janata Dal-United (JD-U), a key ally in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), voiced strong reservations about Narendra Modi’s potential projection as the alliance’s prime ministerial candidate. Citing the 2002 Gujarat riots, JD-U criticized Modi’s failure to prevent communal violence during his tenure as Chief Minister. Party secretary KC Tyagi emphasized JD-U’s commitment to secularism and recalled past actions like opposing BJP leaders during the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. While JD-U did not issue a formal ultimatum, it urged the BJP to clarify its stance through a resolution. Tyagi dismissed popularity as a qualification for leadership and clarified that Nitish Kumar was not seeking the PM post. The party’s final position was expected to be outlined at its National Council meeting, amid growing tensions between JD-U and BJP in several states.",Politics

Unlike its larger, cream-coloured cousin, kala chana has a denser texture and a rich, earthy flavour. Its versatility is what makes it so beloved. Whether you prefer a slow-cooked chana curry with jeera rice, a spicy dry sabzi paired with roti, or a boiled bowl tossed with lemon and masala for a post-workout snack, this little legume can do it all.

One of the most attractive benefits of kala chana is its impressive protein content. For vegetarians especially, it serves as an essential source of plant-based protein.

Just one cup of cooked kala chana provides nearly 15 grams of protein, perfect for muscle repair, immunity, and overall vitality.

If you’re managing weight or simply trying to eat more mindfully, adding Patanjali Kala Chana to your weekly meals can make a big difference.

Try including it in soups, stews, or even breakfast poha for a fibre boost that doesn’t compromise on taste.

For those who’ve grown up with grandma’s wisdom, soaked kala chana early in the morning was almost a ritual. Soaking overnight makes the legumes easier to digest and brings out their full nutrient potential.

Eating a handful of soaked Patanjali Kala Chana with a dash of black salt and lemon in the morning is still a cherished health hack in many Indian households, and for good reason.

It’s low in fat, high in iron and folate, and great for gut health.

Speaking of iron, kala chana is a wonderful food for those dealing with fatigue, anaemia, or low energy. Iron supports red blood cell production and keeps your energy levels up throughout the day.

THE STATESMAN,2025-07-17 00:00:00,Learning from AI,"hile reading a piece of news, I was suddenly reminded of my Class Five half yearly examination. I was first in class, yet had scored only 59 in Mathematics. I was devastated. Our maths teacher, Murali Babu, comforted me saying, “You were in too much of a hurry. Made some silly mistakes. Don’t lose heart. Maybe your score will flip in the annual exam.” That reassurance worked like magic. It gave me strength. In the annual exam, I really scored 95 in Math. Another memory comes to mind.

I was then a postgraduate student. I had written an answer on a short essay by Orwell and went to my teacher, professor Rama Kundu, to see if the answer was correct. While discussing the errors in my answer, she delved deep into the world of Orwell’s writings ~ works I hadn’t yet read. Our syllabus included only one essay by Orwell. But just by showing her one answer written on a question that might come in the exam from that essay, I ended up learning about novels like Animal Farm and 1984. Had I been taught by AI, would I ever have had such experiences? That’s what I was wondering while reading the news that has expressed concern about college and university teachers soon becoming redundant because of AI.

The apprehension has actually been expressed by Sanjeev Sanyal, an economist and a member of the Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council. He has warned universities that artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to upend higher education itself. In a recent podcast hosted by the Indian School of Business (ISB), Sanyal has said that AI would replace traditional undergraduate lectures by providing high-quality, individualised education at scale, frequently for free. “You could just as easily learn from AI instead of spending four years in college,” Sanyal has maintained. He has further said, “AI is capable of giving lectures, responding to enquiries, translating information into any language, and even certifying you.” The majority of undergraduate and many graduate programmes rely on standardised content, which AI can now manage efficiently, according to San – yal. He has said: “The traditional lecture format is obsolete. AI doesn’t just teach ~ it engages, tests, and certifies. In many cases, it does all of this better than humans.”

Sanyal has emphasised that universities need to reinvent themselves in order to remain relevant in the present context. He has admitted that some professions, like medicine, will continue to need practical, handson training, “You can’t use AI to cut a cadaver.” However, AI has the potential to significantly increase the affordability and accessibility of post-secondary education for the majority of theoretical fields. He thinks that this change will significantly close the gap between regional colleges and prestigious universities. Additionally, students could be giv en the flexibility to create multidisciplinary courses and study at their own speed, which is something that traditional universities frequently find difficult to provide. It is true that AI can now easily teach the core subjects taught in graduate courses all over the world.

From one perspective, this is a stark caution to colleges/universities as well as teachers to change themselves immediately. In countries such as India, for example, university curricula are rarely updated, and when they are, undergraduate courses hardly ever include new subjects. Teachers frequently have a great deal of discretion over what they decide to teach in the classroom. They often teach those areas that they are comfortable with. University curricula here, that’s why, often fall short of meeting the demands of the job market. It is true that AI can assist a student in quickly and efficiently gaining the exact knowledge required for employment. That does not, however, imply that AI will soon be able to completely replace undergraduate teachers. For example, many were concerned that human anchors would soon become outdated when a few Indian TV channels began presenting news with AIgenerated anchors.

That has not happened. Similarly, different YouTube channels have long been providing a range of undergraduate courses; however, despite their widespread use, YouTube educational channels have not usurped the place of formal education. They continue to be a supplement to rather than a replacement of the mainstream. Even the once-popular online tutoring apps have lost some of their appeal in recent years. It is a fact that despite countless experiments with various teaching me – thods, no substitute approach has been able to completely replicate the experience of sitting in front of an actual teacher in a physical classroom.

The close bond that develops between a teacher and a student during classroom teaching is the primary cause of this. This connection is frequently silent and conveyed solely by eye contact. No other technique has been able to reproduce this relationship. An undergraduate student might be able to gain the required academic knowledge from AI. AI can take tests, provide prompt answers, and clarify the doubts of the students. However, many students find that the amount of concentration and focus needed to spend hours studying from AI is just too much. Will AI also be able to teach texts unasked for as did my teacher professor Rama Kundu? AI, again, is no match to a teacher’s congratulatory gesture when a student completes an exam successfully or correctly answers a question. It can praise the achievements of a student but the warmth and passion of a human voice will be absent in a machine’s praise. Because of their emotional impact, a teacher’s brief words of encouragement can sometimes transform a student’s life.

AI just can’t do this. AI can never be my class-five math teacher Murali Babu. There is another, more profound factor to take into acco – unt. A teacher and a student have a living, breathing relationship. Teachers frequently get involved in their students’ personal lives. In times of crisis, they provide direction, occasionally even assuming the role of a psychologist/counsellor. AI is incapable of doing this. Let me give the example of one student of mine who tried talking to AI on a regular basis to cope with her depression. However, she discovered that AI repeatedly used different words to express the same concerns. In the end, she decided to tell her teacher the causes of her depression. We should not forget that transferring knowledge and skills is only one aspect of the college/university education system.

Above all, it is a human process. Thus, despite Sanyal’s insistence, AI will never be able to fully replace teachers at the undergraduate level. However, it would be a serious mistake for teachers to use this as an excuse to become complacent and think that they don’t need to change or adapt to the times. We, in our country, now badly need curricula that are much more inquiry-driven, interdisciplinary and focussed on employment than they currently are. Teaching strategies must also evolve. If using AI is necessary to make classrooms more engaging, then so be it. In fact, that is the main challenge that college and university teachers in a country like ours will face in the near future.

(The writer is Professor, Department of English and Culture Studies and Director, Centre for Australian Studies, the University of Burdwan)","In this thoughtful article, the author reflects on how human teachers have profoundly influenced their academic journey—through encouragement, deep engagement, and emotional support—experiences that AI cannot replicate. The piece responds to Sanjeev Sanyal’s assertion that AI could soon replace undergraduate education by offering personalized, scalable learning. While acknowledging AI's strengths—like affordability, accessibility, and content delivery—the author argues that education is fundamentally human. The emotional connection, mentorship, and nuanced guidance teachers offer are irreplaceable. However, the author also stresses that teachers must evolve and adopt modern methods, including AI, to make education more inquiry-driven, interdisciplinary, and career-focused. AI may enhance learning, but it cannot fully replace the human touch in teaching.",Opinion and Editorial

The Telegraph,2025-07-18 00:00:00,We have to first get pardon and then issue of blood money will come: Petitioner to SC on Indian nurse on death row in Yemen,"Attorney General R Venkataramani, appearing for the Centre, told a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta that 'efforts are on' in the matter. The Centre on Friday informed the Supreme Court that efforts were on and the government was trying everything possible to ensure Indian nurse Nimisha Priya, on death row for murder in Yemen, came out safely.

A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta was informed that Priya's execution, scheduled on July 16 had been stayed.

The counsel appearing for petitioner organisation ""Save Nimisha Priya – International Action Council"", which is extending legal support to assist Priya, sought a Centre-appointed delegation to go to Yemen to meet the murder victim's family for negotiation.

The bench said the petitioner could make a representation to the government.

""It has been stated at the Bar that as of now, the execution has been stayed. The petitioner wish to make some representation to the government, which they are free to move,"" the bench said. After Attorney General R Venkataramani said Centre's efforts were on, the petitioner's counsel said the execution had been stayed.

""The first step is, they have postponed it (execution) as of now. We need to first get the pardon. Blood money comes in the second stage. First the family has to forgive us,"" the counsel said.

He said discussion on ""blood money"" could take place after this.

The counsel said Yemen was not a country where anybody could travel to as there was a ban unless allowed by the government.

""You approach the government. The government will consider it. The government is already doing so much for you, taking good care of whatever is possible at their end,"" the bench observed.

The petitioner's counsel urged that a delegation of two or three people from the petitioner organisation and representatives of a religious scholar from Kerala, who is also involved in the matter, could be allowed the travel to Yemen for negotiating with the victim's family.

If the Centre deemed fit, the counsel said, one representative from the government could also go to Yemen.

""I don't think anything formally can happen at this point of time,"" Venkataramani said.

""We will certainly consider that but don't put it on record,"" he said, underlining the government did not want anything to become counterproductive.

When the bench asked whether the execution was stayed indefinitely, the petitioner's counsel said no date was given as of now.

""Which means something is working,"" Venkataramani said.

The petitioner's counsel said Priya's mother was there in Yemen to negotiate with the victim's family and she has gone there as the Delhi High Court asked the Centre to give her permission to travel.

""We can go and negotiate and seek forgiveness from the family so that something can work out,"" he said.

The bench said, ""We are not saying anything. We will just say whatever request they want to make to the government, they may make. The government will consider it. We are not mentioning what is the request"".

Venkataramani said the government wanted Priya to come out safely and doing whatever was possible but did not want to disclose the details at this point in time.

""It is a very difficult situation,"" he said.

Venkataramani said his discussions with the court were being reported in the media.

""That is something we can't stop. Either you request for an in-camera proceeding, we will do that,"" the bench observed.

""I only want that this woman comes out safely,"" Venkataramani said.

The bench posted the hearing on August 14.

The apex court was hearing a plea seeking a direction to the Centre to use diplomatic channels to save Priya, 38, facing execution in Yemen.

Priya, a nurse from Palakkad district of Kerala, was convicted of murdering her Yemeni business partner Talal Abdo Mahdi in 2017. She was sentenced to death in 2020, and her final appeal was rejected in 2023.

She is currently imprisoned in a jail in Sana'a, the capital of Yemen.

The petitioner's counsel earlier told the apex court that payment of blood money to the family of the deceased permissible under the Sharia law could be explored.

He had said the victim's family might pardon Priya if blood money was paid.

On July 17, India said it was in touch with Yemeni authorities as well as certain friendly nations as part of efforts to reach a ""mutually agreeable solution"" in the case relating to Priya.

External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal had said the government was making concerted efforts to seek more time for Priya's family to reach some kind of an understanding with the family of the Yemeni man Priya is convicted of killing.

According to Yemeni court documents, Priya in July 2017 allegedly drugged and murdered Mahdi.","Indian nurse Nimisha Priya’s execution in Yemen for the 2017 murder of her business partner has been stayed, following government efforts. Securing her release now depends on the victim’s family granting forgiveness before any “blood money” is paid. Diplomatic negotiations continue; the plea will be heard again on August 14.

THE STATESMAN,2025-07-18 00:00:00,Narain Karthikeyan biopic: India’s first F1 driver’s life story heads to the big screen,"ndian motorsport is finally getting its big-screen moment. Acclaimed filmmaker Mahesh Narayanan, best known for films like ‘Take Off’, ‘Malik’, and the Locarno-selected ‘Ariyippu’, is stepping into new territory with his latest project, a biopic on Narain Karthikeyan, India’s first-ever Formula One driver.

Currently titled “NK 370”, the film is set to trace the high-octane life of Karthikeyan, who broke social and cultural barriers to race on the world’s most prestigious tracks.Online movie streaming services

The project is being developed by Blue Marble Films, with producers Faraz Ahsan, Vivek Rangachari, and Pratik Maitra backing it.

The screenplay is in the hands of Shalini Usha Devi, who wrote the National Award-winning ‘Soorarai Pottru’.

For Karthikeyan, this film is more than just a sports drama. “Motorsport gave me everything. This film gives that story to the world,” he shared. His journey from a restless kid in Coimbatore to the driver’s seat of a Formula One car is full of challenges, perseverance, and a relentless belief in chasing the impossible.

Mahesh Narayanan says that’s exactly what drew him to the project. “Narain Karthikeyan’s story isn’t just about racing. It’s about conviction, believing in yourself when nobody else does, carrying the hopes of a country, and turning rejection into fuel,” Narayanan said.

The film plans to show the lesser-known aspects of Karthikeyan’s life. It starts in his childhood, where motorsport was quite literally in his blood. His father, a former national rally champion, raised him in a home cluttered with engines, tools, and unfulfilled racing ambitions.Online movie streaming services

Also Read: Kirron Kher makes appearance at Anupam Kher’s ‘Tanvi The Great’ premiere amid cancer battle
By the time he was five, Narain was tearing across the driveway in a homemade go-kart, often preferring rainy days because they made racing more unpredictable, and exciting.

But the path to Formula One wasn’t smooth. Motorsport in India was, and still is, an expensive, niche pursuit. With little government support and no roadmap for Indian drivers, his parents worried constantly about the risks and costs.

Yet, after acing his 10th-grade exams, Narain managed to convince them to let him return to racing. His father even retrofitted a Maruti 800 into a training vehicle and took on the role of his coach.

At just 15, Narain competed in his first Formula Maruti race in Chennai. Starting 17th, he dropped to last place but, in a dramatic final push, overtook 16 cars in the last 10 laps to finish third.

Determined to go global, Karthikeyan enrolled in France’s prestigious Winfield Racing School, where over 30 F1 drivers had trained before him. As the only Indian, and the only brown-skinned driver, Narain faced open racism and bullying from his wealthier, mostly white peers.

But he silenced critics during his final test in wet conditions, clocking the second-fastest lap time and earning the label of “something special.”

The film promises to capture both the highlights and heartbreaks of his racing career: from his early wins in Formula Asia, British Formula Ford, and Formula 3, to his devastating crash at the Macau Grand Prix, where he lost control at 270 km/h while leading the race. That moment nearly ended his dreams.

","Indian motorsport is getting cinematic recognition with ""NK 370"", a biopic on Narain Karthikeyan, India’s first Formula One driver. Directed by Mahesh Narayanan and written by Shalini Usha Devi, the film will explore Karthikeyan’s inspiring journey from a racing-obsessed child in Coimbatore to becoming a global F1 icon. Backed by Blue Marble Films, the project aims to showcase not just the thrills of racing, but the emotional and cultural hurdles Narain overcame—including financial hardship, lack of support in India, and racial discrimination abroad. Starting from karting in a homemade car to training in France and eventually competing on the world’s biggest racing stages, the movie promises a mix of underdog grit, national pride, and personal resilience.",Sports

Allahabad High Court judge Yashwant Varma has moved the Supreme Court seeking to invalidate a report by an in-house inquiry panel, which found him guilty of misconduct in the cash discovery row.

Varma has sought quashing of the May 8 recommendation by then Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna urging Parliament to initiate impeachment against him.

The government plans to move a motion to remove Varma in Parliament's Monsoon session beginning July 21. In his petition, Justice Varma submitted that the inquiry ""reversed the burden of proof"", requiring him to investigate and disprove the charges levelled against him.

Alleging that the panel's findings were based on a preconceived narrative, Justice Varma said the inquiry timelines were driven solely by the urge to conclude proceedings swiftly, even at the expense of ""procedural fairness"".

The petition contended that the inquiry panel drew adverse findings without affording him a full and fair hearing.

The petition is yet to be listed before a bench for a hearing. A report of the inquiry panel probing the incident had said that Justice Varma and his family members had covert or active control over the store room where a huge cache of half-burnt cash was found, proving his misconduct which is serious enough to seek his removal.

The Telegraph,2025-07-17 00:00:00,Priya Nair brings out-of-the-box thinking to the top job at Hindustan Unilever,"HUL’s first woman boss began by listening to India’s poorest shoppers and now she’s steering the multi-billion-dollar company. It came as a shock to some when Hindustan Unilever announced that its next CEO would be a woman. But it shouldn’t have. Unilever veteran Priya Nair was always the frontrunner for the company’s top job in India. In fact, she narrowly missed landing it two years ago when it was last up for grabs.

Nair has been a Hindustan Unilever (HUL) star almost from the day she joined the Rs 60,000-crore consumer products company that fills the shelves of supermarkets and kirana stores across India.

Since 2022, she’s been based in London where, as Business Group President, she has overseen Unilever’s enormous $15-billion global Beauty & Wellness portfolio. She steered the division into premium segments and expanded newer acquisitions, like hydration brand Liquid I.V., into new markets.

“She’s a transformative leader, and her understanding of marketing and branding is top class,” says Harsh Goenka, chairman of RPG Group. Nair was on the board of Goenka’s tyremaker CEAT, and he praises her effusively, adding, “She’s a good person and an authentic leader. She had strategic clarity in whatever initiatives she undertook.”

Nair joined HUL in 1995 as a consumer insights manager and quickly built a reputation for her brand-centric and consumer-first approach. Over the years, she has managed some of HUL’s most iconic products including Dove, Rin, and Comfort.

Amazingly, though, Nair’s most famous initiative during her earlier days at HUL was probably not a product launch. It was an innovative – but oddly named – rural radio service called Kan Khajura Tesan. That translates – if it isn’t immediately clear – to Earthworm Radio Channel.

The service was aimed at impoverished listeners in remote villages with little connectivity. They could place a missed call and receive 15 minutes of music, jokes, and brand messaging. Earthworm Radio fell on rich soil: in its first seven months, it reached over 11 million subscribers, its ads were heard more than 100 million times and it won three prestigious Cannes Gold Lions.

“She combined storytelling with technology in a way few Indian marketers had done before,” said a senior executive who worked with her at the time. “She made the brands feel human.”

What inspired Nair to launch a digital radio? On a trip to rural Tamil Nadu, she spotted a poor farmer buying Comfort fabric conditioner, a premium product usually sold in urban markets. The farmer said it gave clothes a newer feel. That moment made Nair realise that premium products could be sold to less affluent consumers than marketers typically assumed.

“They may not use fabric conditioners every day, but some do use it once or even twice a month. As aspirations begin to change, consumers start upgrading,” she observed. “Consumer brands only win if they listen,” she says.

She calls her mother – “Dr. Mom,” a physician who spent her career caring for patients from less affluent backgrounds – her “strongest female role model” and notes that her mother raised “two successful daughters.” Her sister is a surgical oncologist in Mumbai.

Make no mistake – Nair has a tough task ahead. HUL’s growth has slowed sharply in recent years and it’s lost some of its sheen as one of Unilever’s brightest stars. Current CEO Rohit Jawa hasn’t been able to restore its glow and is stepping down after just two years, barely halfway through his term. He’s expected to leave the company altogether.

But Nair’s reputation is solid in both Mumbai and London where she lives with her entrepreneur husband, Manmohan Nair, and their teenage daughter Mehak. HUL shares jumped 4.6 per cent when news of her return to India became public, and rose 7.7 per cent last week. “She comes with a strong track record,” said Citi Research on an optimistic note. Nair will continue in her global role as a member of the Unilever Leadership Executive.

Her experience in beauty and wellness – both in India and globally – will be crucial in the months ahead. Online competitors like Nykaa have grown strongly, and foreign beauty brands are muscling into India. At one end, upmarket Indian consumers want greater variety and newer products. At the other end, private labels are targeting budget-conscious buyers.

In fact, HUL is facing sharp competition in nearly all its sectors: beauty, soaps, foods – even packaged tea. As a result, HUL’s average volume growth has dropped to just 2 per cent.

The slowdown has been reflected in the stock price: after doubling in the six years to 2023, it has since fallen by a tenth. Globally too, Unilever’s performance has weakened, and there are occasional calls for it to be broken up. It has already separated its ice cream division and plans to list it as a standalone public company. It may also sell some of its US ice cream brands.

Goenka is unstinting in his admiration for Nair, saying she shows empathy but can be hardnosed when required. “She’s a toughie, not a soft leader or anything like that. She works through her mind and her heart – so that’s a nice combination.”

On a similar note, Rediffusion chief Sandeep Goyal, who worked with her on several campaigns, describes her as “extremely fast on the uptake” and “a very tough negotiator.” He adds, “I, however, loved the fact that she could so easily say ‘no’ with a nice warm smile. The steel has a silky sheath, for sure.”

What changes will Nair kick off in the coming months? Analysts expect her to introduce new brands from Unilever’s vast global cupboard. HUL will also need to sharpen its online performance and engage more deeply with social media influencers and digital marketing.

It’s worth noting that Priya Nair isn’t the first woman star performer at HUL. Before her, there was Leena Nair (née Menon), who rose to become Unilever’s global Chief Human Resources Officer. Leena, a potential HUL chief, left the company and is now global CEO of Chanel, the French luxury giant. She has emphasised the human side of leadership and aims to remember the names and faces of as many of Chanel’s 20,000 employees as possible.

By a startling coincidence, both Priya and Leena Nair come from Malayalee families settled in Kolhapur, Maharashtra.

Could Priya Nair rise even higher? At 53, she still has time on her side. Might she one day become the first Indian woman to head Unilever globally? It’s a long journey and many challenges lie ahead – but it’s far from inconceivable.","Priya Nair becomes HUL’s first woman CEO, bringing global expertise and a consumer-first approach. Known for innovations like Kan Khajura Tesan, she faces challenges including slowing growth, rising competition, and digital transition. Backed by trust in Mumbai and London, analysts expect her to revitalize HUL with new brands and sharper strategies.",National News

He cited recent actions by the Delhi government, such as halting testing by some private laboratories and hospitals, as evidence of a deviation from the recommended strategy of testing, tracing, isolating, and treating.

Harsh Vardhan claimed that while all other states are following the Centre’s guidelines earnestly, Delhi appears to be working in reverse and diluting the severity of the issue. These remarks come amid a surge in Covid-19 cases in the capital, along with anecdotal reports about residents facing difficulties in getting tested or finding hospital beds.

In response, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led Delhi government rejected the Union Minister’s criticism, calling it a “wrong assessment.” They maintained that their actions were in line with efforts to streamline pandemic management and not intended to underreport the situation.","On June 8, 2020, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan accused the Delhi government of underreporting Covid-19 cases and not following national health protocols.

Known for his penchant for painting landscapes featuring miniature art, inspired by his childhood in rural West Bengal, the exhibition is a testament to his artistic journey of almost 22 years.

An alumnus of Government Art College, he was always averse to the rigid setting of academia, and preferred observing the nature around him, the forest behind his home, which to this date shapes his artistic vocabulary.Online art courses

“As a child, I loved catching birds, watching them closely, observing the forest, and feeling connected to everything around me,” he fondly recalls in an interaction with The Statesman.

Mountains and villages are the two constants in all of his landscapes, channeling his childhood.

This organic bond with nature and sheer urge to break away from the traditional techniques taught in colleges, led him to carve out his own signature style of ‘Semi Wash.’ Here, the paper is soaked in water for nearly an hour, and only after the colour is applied. The result? A colourful tranquillity on paper, as the colour spreads out, choosing its own course.

“I don’t draw anything on the paper, rather visualise my picture and directly go in with the colour.” “In the beginning, the colours played with me,” he smiles, “but now, I play with the colours.”

Another recurring element is the balance maintained in his  paintings between the intricate details and the softness of the colour. To this he added- “Painting is like mathematics. Everything needs to be measured. Everything needs to be thought out. One time I had spent almost two days deciding where to put my signature.”

Scaling up the miniature paintings on larger pages comes with its own set of challenges, especially in watercolor, where you can’t undo the mistakes unlike oil and acrylic. Miniature paintings, which traditionally come in smaller dimensions, feature exquisite details. To keep its character intact, he initially started painting on 5×5 inch paper.

“Slowly I moved up to bigger frames as I started getting better. Though even now, I feel I am learning with every work,” he admits humbly.

For him, his art is not his livelihood, rather his life itself. It is beneath his skill and artistry, what drives this journey of 22 years is his set of unshakable principles. As a message to the young generation who want to pursue art, he added, “Have a set of principles apart from your work and never compromise on them. Honesty, sincerity, punctuality — these are non-negotiable for me. And don’t make excuses. Stick to your words — it will reflect in your work.”Online art courses

The U.S. government designated The Resistance Front, considered an offshoot of the Pakistani extremist group Lashkar-e-Taiba, as a ""foreign terrorist organization"" over the April 22 Islamist militant attack in Kashmir that killed 26 people, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement on Thursday. The Resistance Front, also known as Kashmir Resistance, initially took responsibility for the attack in Pahalgam before denying it days later.

Lashkar-e-Taiba, listed as a ""foreign terrorist organization"" by the United States, is an Islamist group accused of plotting attacks in India and in the West, including the three-day deadly assault on Mumbai in November 2008. TRF's designation by Washington as a ""foreign terrorist organization"" and ""specially designated global terrorist"" enforced President Donald Trump's ""call for justice for the Pahalgam attack,"" Rubio said.

Rubio called TRF a ""front and proxy"" for Lashkar-e-Taiba. It is considered an offshoot of Lashkar-e-Taiba, according to the South Asia Terrorism Portal, a Delhi-based think tank. TRF emerged in 2019.

The attack sparked heavy fighting between nuclear-armed Asian neighbors India and Pakistan in the latest escalation of a decades-old rivalry as New Delhi blamed the attack on Pakistan. Islamabad denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation. Washington condemned the attack but did not directly blame Pakistan. On May 7, Indian jets bombed sites across the border that New Delhi described as ""terrorist infrastructure,"" setting off an exchange of attacks between the two countries by fighter jets, missiles, drones, and artillery that killed dozens until a ceasefire on May 10. The ceasefire was first announced by Trump on social media after Washington held talks with both sides, but India has differed with Trump's claims that it resulted from his intervention and threats to sever trade talks.

India's position has been that New Delhi and Islamabad must resolve their problems directly and with no outside involvement.

The Telegraph,2025-07-18 00:00:00,London’s Kew Gardens to turn a new leaf: 177-year-old building closing in 2027 for major upgrade,"The goal of the construction project is to address 'serious signs of deterioration', the announcement said, and also to help Kew Gardens meet its climate goals. For generations, plant-lovers have come to the glass Palm House at Kew Gardens in London to climb a spiral staircase, stroll along a walkway and peer down on the green scalp of the jungle below.

But in recent years, the structure has started to show its 177 years. Paint is blistering off the rusting iron, and heat from a gas boiler escapes from around its 16,000 panes of glass.

“It’s starting to degrade,” said Reuben Briggs, who is in charge of capital projects for Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, as the gardens are formally known. He noted the tropical climate that the greenhouse simulates places strain on the building. “It’s dripping with condensation, and that cast and wrought iron is starting to corrode,” he said.

So in 2027, Kew announced on Wednesday, the Palm House will close for four years for a major renovation, along with the Waterlily House, its 19th-century neighbour. The goal of the construction project is to address “serious signs of deterioration”, the announcement said, and also to help Kew Gardens meet its climate goals.

“The key thing for us is to conserve the building, but also improve it for the future,” Briggs said. “So improve it for the plants, improve it for the visitors, but also make sure that it’s able to cope with the changing climate as well.”

Kew Gardens, which is a major tourist attraction and a hub for botanical research, hopes to be “climate positive” by 2030. To do so, it will need to store more carbon than it releases.

While its thousands of plants absorb carbon dioxide, the two hulking, Victorian-era glasshouses being renovated are not energy efficient.

They opened in 1848 and 1852, during Britain’s rapid industrialisation, when humans started burning fossil fuels on a mass scale and warming the planet. Today, the heat from a gas boiler, which dates from the 1980s, leaks from the Palm House through the old windows.

So the buildings will need to be gutted.

Each of 16,000 panes of glass in the Palm House, which is kept at a minimum of 18°C and 75 per cent humidity, needs to be replaced with windows that have thicker glazing, Briggs said. They will need to be sealed better. The iron in both structures must be blasted and tested, and some places may need to be strengthened before it can be repainted.

“It’s not in danger of imminent collapse, or anything like that,” Briggs said. “But we need to make sure we’re tackling it now.”

The gas-powered heating system will also be replaced with electric air pumps, Briggs added, while the electrical system and watering system will also be replaced. He said that work is projected to reduce the amount of energy that is needed to heat the building by at least 60 per cent.

Kew Gardens plans to start construction in 2027 and finish in 2031, and has raised about a third of the $80.4 million that it needs to complete the renovation.

The Palm House has had to adapt before. Its original glass panels were green, which the original curator believed would give the plants more shade.

Later, Kew’s experts decided this was a mistake. The dark glass blocked too much light, and in the 1890s, industrial pollution dirtied the glass even further. The green glass was replaced with clear panes, so the palms could grow in a changing world. Moving the plants will be its own challenge.

The Waterlily House is emptied and cleaned every winter, so moving the aquatic plants from their inky ponds will be fairly routine.

But most of its 1,300 plants in the Palm House are either endangered or extinct in the wild.

The horticulturists have already started to prep.

Some of the plants can be easily taken to a temporary glasshouse or moved to other parts of the gardens. Others are trickier. Kew has what is believed to be the world’s oldest potted plant: an Eastern Cape giant cycad from South Africa (Encephalartos altensteinii), which was brought to Kew on a ship in 1775, which Briggs said was “in a big wooden tub”. It weighs more than a tonne.

“They are very worried about moving that one,” he said. “Just logistically: How do they lift it without damaging it?”

Other plants are just too big to move, so they are being propagated in a separate greenhouse and replaced, a standard part of the gardens’ maintenance even outside of renovation.

This is an especially high-stakes operation for threatened plants, like the Ravenea moorei, which was thought to be extinct in the wild until 2023, when a Kew researcher found 12 specimens in the Comoro Islands and brought some samples back.

Briggs said he did not know if the plant, which stands at over 35 feet tall, would survive a move. “It’s the biggest one in there,” he said. “If we had to, if we hadn’t found it in the wild, we’d have had to find a way to do it.”","Kew Gardens’ iconic Palm House and Waterlily House will close for up to five years from 2027 for urgent renovation due to deterioration. The £60 million project will restore structure, replace 16,000 glass panes, shift plant collections, and install electric heat pumps, aiming for the world’s first net-zero heritage glasshouses.

The Telegraph,2025-07-18 00:00:00,Brazilian President Lula rejects US tariffs as ‘unacceptable blackmail’ and refuses to take orders from Trump,"Lula and members of his cabinet have rejected the reasoning behind the tariffs and insisted on Brazil's sovereignty, while calling for trade negotiations with the United States. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Thursday said he would not take orders over tariffs from a foreigner, referring to U.S. President Donald Trump, and later called the United States' threatened duty ""unacceptable blackmail.""

The comments, made during two separate events, mark a continuation of a spat between the two leaders that escalated when the U.S. announced a 50% tariff on Brazil last week.

Trump attributed the tariff, set to start in August, to Brazil's treatment of former President Jair Bolsonaro and to trade practices against U.S. companies that he said are unfair. The tariff announcement came days after Lula called Trump an ""emperor"" the world does not want.

Lula and members of his cabinet have rejected the reasoning behind the tariffs and insisted on Brazil's sovereignty, while calling for trade negotiations with the United States.

""No foreigner is going to give orders to this president,"" Lula said in a speech, using the slang word 'gringo', which in Brazil is a common term for foreigners without the pejorative sense it carries in other parts of Latin America.

He added that Brazil would go ahead with regulation and taxation of U.S. tech firms, telling a gathering of leftist student activists in the state of Goias that tech firms are conduits of violence and fake news disguised as freedom of expression.

Later on Thursday, during an evening TV and radio address to the nation, Lula said the defense of Brazil's sovereignty extends to protecting itself against the actions of foreign digital platforms.

During the near five-minute address, Lula said Brazil has been negotiating with the U.S. over tariffs, and repeated that the Latin America country had sent a proposal in May.

""We expected a response, and what we received was unacceptable blackmail, in the form of threats to Brazilian institutions and false information about trade between Brazil and the United States,"" Lula said.

Brasilia has been holding discussions with industry groups and companies that will be affected by the U.S. tariff, while also readying potential retaliatory measures if talks fall through.

Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira told CNN Brasil separately on Thursday that Lula was open to talks with Trump, who had not yet met each other.

""If the circumstances are given, they will speak,"" he added. Lula, who is in his third non-consecutive term as president of Latin America's largest economy, saw his approval ratings start to rebound after the trade spat with Trump last week.","Brazilian President Lula firmly rejected US President Trump’s 50% tariff on Brazilian imports, calling it “unacceptable blackmail.” Lula emphasized Brazil’s sovereignty and vowed matching tariffs in retaliation. While urging for negotiations, Lula challenged US deficit claims, cited trade surpluses, formed a crisis committee, and signaled intent to enact reciprocal trade laws.",International News
THE STATESMAN,2025-07-17 00:00:00,Shifting Triangles,"hief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan’s recent warning about a potential China-Pakistan-Bangla – desh convergence is more than caution from the country’s top military brass; it is a flashing yellow light on South Asia’s strategic dashboard. While Dhaka still claims to pursue a carefully balanced foreign policy, Beijing’s widening footprint ~ through ports, power plants and defence deals ~ pushes regional alignments into unprecedented territory. Islamabad is already deeply entwined with Chinese supply chains, and Bangladesh’s gradual tilt, driven by an economic calculus, could complete a triangle encircling In dia on three flanks. General Chauhan delivered his assessment against a backdrop of mounting economic fragility across the Indian Ocean littoral.

Nations from Sri Lanka to the Maldives juggle ballooning debts, often owed to China. In Colombo’s case, default triggered political unrest until an Indian rescue line bought precious breathing space. Yet such interventions must now compete with assertive debt diplomacy models that swap quick liquidity for long-term leverage, granting Beijing both physical assets and political influence. The CDS also flagged a subtler complication: the United States’ shifting priorities. Washington’s tendency to signal without committing leaves room for divergent interpretations in Asian capitals. For India, strategic autonomy must not mutate into strategic ambiguity. A crisply articulated doctrine that defines red lines, cooperative corridors and escalation thresholds is needed urgently, or ambiguity will be misread as permission by actors eager to re-shape the regional order. Pakistan’s handling of the 87-hour May conflict underscores those stakes.

By escalating a terrorist provocation into conventional warfare, Rawal pindi displayed both audacity and dependence: audacity in raising risks and dependence on Beijing’s logistical umbilical cord that keeps advanced platforms serviceable. Chinese technicians embedded in Pakistani bases blur the civilian ilianmilitary boundary and complicate attribution in any future clash, effectively inserting Beijing into South Asia’s crisis calculus. That vision must also acknowledge Bangla desh’s legitimate development aspirations. India can cooperate in green energy corridors, climate-resilient farming, and cross-border digital services, offering technology and market access over high-interest loans. Such partnerships reduce Dhaka’s exposure to single-source financiers while binding its growth path to a transparent, rules-based regional order ~ a goal that aligns with Delhi’s own quest for a stable periphery and shared prosperity. Above all, India must narrate a story that resonates beyond trench lines ~ one of shared prosperity anchored in transparency. Regional history shows influence flows not just from power, but from dependability. Online TV streaming services


General Chauhan’s reminder that trian g les can shift should provoke vigilance as well as creativity; their edges can be blunted by steady engagement. Equally vital is civil society outreach: scholarships for ocean-rim students, media partnerships, and tri-service humanitarian exercises can knit a lattice of goodwill that pure military capability cannot replicate. Such soft-power dividends accumulate quietly yet shape perceptions decisively. They cultivate stakeholders who favour India’s moderation. The coming decade will test whether India can match its demographic heft and technological promise with strategic stamina. Success would leave the emerging triangle balanced rather than adversarial, securing geometry conducive to growth across the subcontinent.

","Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan has raised a critical warning about a potential China-Pakistan-Bangladesh strategic convergence, suggesting it could encircle India on three fronts. While Bangladesh maintains a balanced foreign policy, China’s growing investments in its infrastructure and defence hint at deeper alignment. Pakistan’s dependence on China, including embedded Chinese technicians in military bases, adds complexity to regional tensions.

General Chauhan emphasizes the need for India to define clear red lines and adopt a proactive doctrine to avoid being misinterpreted amid shifting US priorities. He also advocates for India to counter China's influence not just militarily, but through soft-power tools: offering development partnerships to Bangladesh in green energy, digital services, and climate-resilient agriculture, and strengthening civil society ties through scholarships and regional cooperation.

The message is clear: India must combine strategic vigilance with regional engagement to ensure the emerging China-aligned triangle becomes a balanced and cooperative geometry, not a hostile one.

Mark Zuckerberg and current and former directors and officers of Meta Platforms agreed on Thursday to settle claims seeking $8 billion for the damage they allegedly caused the company by allowing repeated violations of Facebook users' privacy, a lawyer for the shareholders told a Delaware judge on Thursday.

The parties did not disclose details of the settlement and defense lawyers did not address the judge, Kathaleen McCormick of the Delaware Court of Chancery. McCormick adjourned the trial just as it was to enter its second day and she congratulated the parties.

The plaintiffs' lawyer, Sam Closic, said the agreement just came together quickly. Billionaire venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who is a defendant in the trial and a Meta director, was scheduled to testify on Thursday.

Shareholders of Meta sued Zuckerberg, Andreessen and other former company officials including former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg in hopes of holding them liable for billions of dollars in fines and legal costs the company paid in recent years.

The Federal Trade Commission fined Facebook $5 billion in 2019 after finding that it failed to comply with a 2012 agreement with the regulator to protect users' data.

The shareholders wanted the 11 defendants to use their personal wealth to reimburse the company. The defendants denied the allegations, which they called ""extreme claims."" Facebook changed its name to Meta in 2021. The company was not a defendant.

The company declined to comment. A lawyer for the defendants did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“This settlement may bring relief to the parties involved, but it’s a missed opportunity for public accountability,"" said Jason Kint, the head of Digital Content Next, a trade group for content providers.

Zuckerberg was expected to take the stand on Monday and Sandberg on Wednesday. The trial was scheduled to run through the end of next week.

The case was also expected to include testimony from former Facebook board members Peter Thiel, Palantir Technologies co-founder, and Reed Hastings, co-founder of Netflix .

Meta investors alleged in the lawsuit that former and current board members completely failed to oversee the company's compliance with the 2012 FTC agreement and claim that Zuckerberg and Sandberg knowingly ran Facebook as an illegal data harvesting operation. The case followed revelations that data from millions of Facebook users was accessed by Cambridge Analytica, a now-defunct political consulting firm that worked for Donald Trump's successful U.S. presidential campaign in 2016. Those revelations led to the FTC fine, which was a record at the time.

On Wednesday, an expert witness for the plaintiffs testified about what he called ""gaps and weaknesses"" in Facebook's privacy policies but would not say if the company violated the 2012 agreement that Facebook reached with the FTC.

Jeffrey Zients, a former board member, testified on Wednesday that the company did not agree to the FTC fine to spare Zuckerberg legal liability, as shareholders allege.

On its website, the company has said it has invested billions of dollars into protecting user privacy since 2019.

The trial would have been a rare opportunity for Meta investors to see Zuckerberg answer probing questions under oath. In 2017, Zuckerberg was expected to testify at a trial involving a lawsuit by company investors opposed to his plan to issue a special class of Facebook stock that would have extended his control over that company. That case also settled before he took the stand.

""Facebook has successfully remade the 'Cambridge Analytica' scandal about a few bad actors rather than an unraveling of its entire business model of surveillance capitalism and the reciprocal, unbridled sharing of personal data,"" Kint said. ""That reckoning is now left unresolved.""","Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, along with current and former executives including Sheryl Sandberg and Marc Andreessen, agreed to settle an $8 billion Delaware lawsuit over repeated Facebook privacy violations. The settlement details are undisclosed; the case stemmed from years of lax privacy oversight and the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Trial ended abruptly.",International News
Hindustan Times,2020-06-08 00:00:00,NREGS workforce gets younger as migrants seek jobs in their villages,"New Delhi : More younger people are seeking jobs under the government’s flagship rural job guarantee scheme — indicating the impact of the return of migrant labour from cities back home to the hinterland because of the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown imposed to slow its spread that stopped work at construction sites and factories around the country, and also forced restaurants and retail stores to down shutters.

April saw a tepid start of the world’s largest job programme, with 12.8 million households asking for work. Officials point out that a hard lockdown, lack of preparation at the state level and scarcity of workers led to low demand even as millions were stranded jobless.

But as more migrant workers went back to their states, the demand for work jumped by 181% in May, with 36.1 million households wanting work, according to official data.

With younger workers having returned to their villages, their participation in MGNREGS has increased.

Among the people employed in the flagship job programme this year, 31.1% are in the 31-40 age group. And another 30%in the 41-50 age bracket. For last year, the corresponding figures were 29.5% and 29.6%. ","The Covid-19 pandemic has significantly altered the workforce dynamics of the MGNREGS, with more younger individuals seeking rural employment after returning to their villages from cities.

""Practice has proven that through dialogue and consultation, with leadership and communication at the highest levels, we can properly manage contradictions and resolve our differences,"" he said.

""We will continue to strengthen dialogue and communication, deepen consensus, reduce misunderstandings, enhance cooperation, to jointly put China-U.S. economic and trade relations back on track to achieve healthy, stable and sustainable development.""

China's rare earths exports rose 32% month-on-month in June, customs data showed on Monday, in a sign that agreements struck last month in London to free up the flow of the metals were possibly bearing fruit.

Chipmaker Nvidia will also resume selling its H20 AI chips to China, Chief Executive Jensen Huang said at an event in Beijing this week, a move U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said was also part of negotiations on rare earths.

Wang said on Friday that he had met Huang the previous day, describing the meeting as evidence that ""as the dust settles, everyone has come to the conclusion - especially the U.S. side - that forced decoupling is impossible.""

Wang said the current overall tariff level imposed by the U.S. on China was ""still high"" at 53.6%. Analysts have said that additional duties exceeding 35% will probably wipe out Chinese manufacturers' profit margins.

""Both sides have come to understand that they need each other, as lots of the goods and services that we exchange are irreplaceable, or at least difficult to exchange in the short-term,"" Wang said.

""China does not want a trade war, but it is not afraid of one,"" he reiterated. ","China and the U.S. must reach a lasting tariff deal by August 12 to avoid renewed trade tensions. China’s Commerce Minister Wang called for responsibility from major powers, affirming interdependence and opposing forced decoupling. Talks have eased rare earth restrictions; failure to finalize could threaten global supply chains with 100%+ tariffs.",International News
The Telegraph,2025-07-18 00:00:00,Horrific fire' kills 61 in Iraq: Most victims appear to have suffocated,"The ministry said it had opened an investigation into the fire in Kut, which is southeast of Baghdad. A fire ripped through a shopping mall in eastern Iraq and killed at least 61 people, including children, according to local officials, who blamed the scale of the tragedy on shoddy construction and a lack of preparedness.

Iraq’s interior ministry said the “horrific fire” began on Wednesday night and swept through a recently opened, five-storey shopping centre in the city of Kut. Most of the victims appeared to have suffocated “due to heavy smoke”, the ministry said in a statement, adding that 14 bodies were so badly charred that they had yet to be identified.

The ministry said it had opened an investigation into the fire in Kut, which is southeast of Baghdad.

According to Habib al-Badri, the head of the province’s security committee, an electric malfunction sparked the fire. But he said poor building practices and an unprepared rescue service had worsened the casualty toll.

“There was a lack of emergency exits and emergency ladders and extinguishers. And unfortunately the province was not prepared for such an incident,” he said. “We hope what happened will be a lesson for the future.”

Some political leaders in Iraq moved quickly to cite the fire as another devastating consequence of pervasive corruption in the country. Many regional analysts say that is a legacy of the US occupation of Iraq, when money was widely dispersed for construction projects and contracts with poor oversight. And many Iraqis complain that graft only worsened in the years since.

“This tragedy adds to the tragedies and suffering of the Iraqi people as a result of so many forms of corruption and repeated neglect,” Muqtada al-Sadr, an influential Shia cleric in Iraq, said.

The country’s commission of federal integrity, an independent body that deals with government accountability, highlighted what it said were shortcomings in the initial response to the fire by the ministry’s rescue services, saying in a statement that it would also investigate the blaze.","At least 61–69 people died, including children, after a fire swept through the newly opened five-story Corniche Hypermarket mall in Kut, Iraq. The blaze, likely sparked by an electrical fault, was worsened by poor construction and lack of safety measures. Authorities are investigating; officials blame corruption and inadequate emergency preparedness.",International News
The Telegraph,2025-07-18 00:00:00,‘Press has to learn to be truthful’: Donald Trump threatens to sue Wall Street Journal over Epstein letter,"The Wall Street Journal reported that Ghislaine Maxwell put together a special birthday album for the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s 50th birthday, featuring messages from his family and friends — among them, a letter from Donald Trump. US President Donald Trump has threatened legal action against The Wall Street Journal following its publication of a report claiming he sent a birthday letter to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday.

The revelation has sparked fresh controversy over Trump’s past ties with Epstein, which the President has repeatedly downplayed.

“The Wall Street Journal, and Rupert Murdoch, personally, were warned directly by President Donald J. Trump that the supposed letter they printed by President Trump to Epstein was a FAKE and, if they print it, they will be sued. Mr. Murdoch stated that he would take care of it but, obviously, did not have the power to do so. The Editor of The Wall Street Journal, Emma Tucker, was told directly by Karoline Leavitt, and by President Trump, that the letter was a FAKE, but Emma Tucker didn’t want to hear that. Instead, they are going with a false, malicious, and defamatory story anyway. President Trump will be suing The Wall Street Journal, NewsCorp, and Mr. Murdoch, shortly. The Press has to learn to be truthful, and not rely on sources that probably don’t even exist,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.

He called it “yet another example of FAKE NEWS!”

The Wall Street Journal reported that Ghislaine Maxwell put together a special birthday album for Jeffrey Epstein’s 50th birthday, featuring messages from his family and friends — among them, a letter from Donald Trump.

The report states that the letter signed with Donald Trump’s name includes several lines of typewritten text, allegedly bordered by a hand-drawn outline of a nude woman sketched in bold marker.

In a Tuesday evening interview with The Wall Street Journal, Trump dismissed the letter and drawing as fake. He claimed that the report is a fabricated story by the Journal.

The Epstein case has split the Trump support base. Elon Musk is among those who have been pressing for the release of the Epstein files that purportedly contain the sex trafficker's full client list.

Many American and global big names figure in the list is what many including a section of Trump's MAGA fan base believe.","The Wall Street Journal reported that Ghislaine Maxwell compiled a 2003 birthday album for Jeffrey Epstein featuring messages from friends, including a letter attributed to Donald Trump, which included typewritten text, Trump’s signature, and a sketch of a nude woman.

Hindustan Times,2020-06-07 00:00:00,Kejriwal warns hospitals against ‘black marketing’,"
New Delhi : Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal served a stern warning to private hospitals on Saturday, accusing some of them of lying about the number of beds they had for patients of the coronavirus disease and promising tough action against health facilities that, he said, were engaged in extortionist practices during the public health crisis — comments that came against the backdrop of a spate of reports and social media posts detailing difficulties people faced in hospital admissions.

Kejriwal said the Delhi government would issue an order making it mandatory for hospitals to admit and treat patients who were in moderate to serious condition even if Covid-19 tests hadn’t been conducted on them or test results were still awaited.

By evening, the order was out mandating that “no patient who is having Covid-19 symptoms and is in moderate and severe category be denied admission on the pretext that the patient is not having Covid positive report.” All such patients should be kept in the Covid suspect patient area till the test report is received. “Accordingly, if found positive, then she/he shall be kept in the Covid hospital and otherwise transferred to non-Covid hospital for further management,” the order read.

The order starts off by admitting that “there has been a surge in the number of positive cases of Covid-19 in the past one week in Delhi, resulting in additional demand for hospital beds, consumables and infrastructure.”

In the past six days (Monday to Saturday) Delhi has seen an average of 1301new cases a day. The city’s total n Saturday night stood at 27,654 cases, 16,229 active cases,10,664 recoveries, and 761 deaths.

The government will deploy a medical professional at all hospitals in the city to check the availability of beds and ensure patients are not denied admission on the account of what the chief minister called false refusal by hospitals. “Not all private hospitals are bad. But there are a few that first refuse to admit a patient saying there are no beds and later, on insistence, ask for ₹5-8 lakh for admission. This is nothing but black-marketing of beds,” he said at a news conference by video link. “Please give me a few days. We will end this business of black marketing of beds.”

On Thursday, June 4, the Directorate General of Health Service of the Delhi government issued an order that asked “all private hospitals identified for the purpose of treating Covid-19 patients ... to provide ... their respective schedule of charges” by June 5.

Kejriwal’s warning came on the day Hindustan Times documented cases of patients who had been unable to find beds at hospitals in Delhi and Mumbai despite the insistence of government officials in both cities that there were a sufficient number of beds for treatment of Covid-19 patients.

And it came two days after the Delhi government issued an order asking hospitals to discharge mild or asymptomatic patients of Covid-19 within 24 hours as they are supposed to be either in home isolation or be sent to Covid care centres.

“It has come to our notice that many asymptomatic and mild symptom cases have been admitted in hospital facilities… Any mild or asymptomatic patient has to be discharged by the hospital within 24 hours of admission,” read the order dated June 4.

The Delhi government has been trying to reinforce hospital infrastructure for treatment of Covid-19 patients. On Friday, it directed five Covid-dedicated government hospitals to increase their bed capacity to 13,670, including 750 with ventilators, in three weekly phases to be completed by June 25. Earlier in the week, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said three more private hospitals will be converted into Covid-19 treatment facilities; he warned that hospitals with mixed use beds (20% reserved for Covid-19 patients) would be converted into dedicated facilities for treatment of the coronavirus disease if they didn’t comply with the rule. The chief minister said that some private hospitals refused outright to accept Covid-19 patients. “A few hospitals are very powerful. They have contacts in almost all parties. But no matter what, you will have to take corona patients. That is non-negotiable. We had allowed you to build hospitals not to mint money, but to be at the service of the people of Delhi. No one will be spared and any non-compliance would attract strict action,” Kejriwal said.

Since Friday, the government has had meetings with the owners of at least 33 private hospitals in Delhi who were told not to deny admission to any serious Covid patients or suspected Covid cases.At these meetings, the hospitals were also given a chance to articulate the problems they faced that could be resolved through mutual agreement, Kejriwal said.

According to the government, as many as 1,100 new Covid hospital admissions have been recorded in the city since the Delhi Corona mobile application, which enables people to track the number of vacant hospital beds, was launched on Tuesday. “The app, which is first of its kind in the world, has made hospitals more accessible. On Tuesday, when the app was launched, the Delhi government had 2,800 admissions in hospitals, maximum of which were in Delhi government hospitals. Today, 3,900 patients are admitted and mostly in private facilities,” Kejriwal said.

The app will be updated twice every day, once at 10am and then at 6pm.Kejriwal said that if the app showed that hospital beds were vacant, but hospital staff refuse admission, people can call on the helpline number 1031.

The chief minister also cleared the air about some private laboratories not conducting Covid-19 tests. He said that all Delhi government hospitals and most private ones have “flu clinics” where people can get Covid-19 tests done. Apart from those, the Delhi government has 12 testing labs.

“There are reports that testing is not happening in Delhi. This is not true. Delhi has 42 labs out of which only six labs are temporarily not operating because we have taken action against them for violating ICMR {Indian Council of Medical Research} guidelines. Is it wrong to take action against those who are not doing their jobs well during this pandemic? Delhi currently is doing the highest number of tests compared to all states,” he said.

As of Saturday night, 4,225 patients were being treated at the city’s hospitals and a total of 4,412 beds were vacant in government and private hospitals combined.

Government reports state that Delhi has one of the highest testing rates with 11,285 tests per million population, as against the national average of 3,291 tests per million.

Till Saturday, 246,873 Covid-19 tests had been conducted in Delhi, up from 241,693 on Friday and 236,506 on Thursday.

Cautioning people not to panic, Kejriwal said only those with mild, moderate, serious or severe symptoms of Covid-19 should get themselves tested. “Those who are asymptomatic should refrain from testing. Because if they also start lining up for testing, then no matter how many centres we open, it will still not be enough. So, only symptomatic people should get Covid tests done,” Kejriwal said.

That’s a suggestion that goes against science which recommends that all asymptomatic people who have a high risk of infection (direct contact with an infected person; or who are health care or frontline workers) be tested simply because the chances of them infecting the most vulnerable (people with co-morbidities and senior citizens) is higher. Kejriwal himself, in early April, said Delhi would go for “mass testing like South Korea” did to halt the spread of the pandemic.

The Delhi Medical Association (DMA) issued a statement condemning “the way the CM warned the doctors and threatened the hospitals” over Covid-19 patients’ admissions and tests.

“Doctors who are serving the people of Delhi tirelessly from last two months in this pandemic, risking their lives, feel insulted by the way they are being treated. Hospitals are the backbone of healthcare and are serving the patients, Covid or non-Covid. They are being penalised and the government, instead of praising their efforts, is issuing new diktats daily,” said Dr BB Wadhwa, president of the DMA.

The association demanded the formation of a coordination committee that would look after all the health care facilities for management of the Covid-19 crisis. It also demanded adequate testing facilities for early detection and treatment and said every hospital or nursing home giving Coivd care should have its own dedicated testing lab facility.","On June 7, 2020, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal issued a strong warning to private hospitals for allegedly black marketing COVID-19 beds and refusing admissions despite availability. He announced strict action against such practices and mandated that all patients with COVID-19 symptoms in moderate or severe condition must be admitted even without test results. To prevent admission refusals, the government deployed medical professionals at hospitals and introduced a real-time hospital bed availability app. Kejriwal also emphasized increased testing, claiming Delhi had the highest rate in India, and dismissed allegations of testing shortages. However, his warning drew criticism from the Delhi Medical Association, which said doctors felt insulted and demanded better coordination and support from the government.",Health and Wellness

The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) took to social media platform X to celebrate the achievement, posting, “Apple harvests record iPhone output from its India orchard,” highlighting the country’s growing role in global tech manufacturing.

According to data by market research firm Canalys, iPhone production in India jumped 53 per cent year-on-year (YoY) between January and June 2025, reaching 23.9 million units.

This is Apple’s strongest ramp-up since it began assembling smartphones in the country in 2017.

The rise is seen as part of Apple’s strategy to reduce reliance on China, especially with the looming threat of higher US tariffs on Chinese goods.

Exports also followed the same growth trend, increasing by 53 per cent compared to the same period previous year, the report said.

The United States was the biggest destination for iPhones made in India, receiving 78 per cent of all exports — up from 53 per cent a year earlier.

Other markets such as the Netherlands, the UAE, the UK, and Japan saw a decline in their share of Indian iPhone shipments.

Foxconn led the charge in manufacturing, contributing more than half of the iPhones exported, according to the report.

Tata Group has also emerged as a strong player, now accounting for nearly 40 per cent of Apple’s iPhone exports from India.

Analysts say this shows better manufacturing output and growing confidence from Apple in India’s capabilities.Online TV streaming services

“This could be Apple’s earliest ever flagship production ramp-up from India,” said Sanyam Chaurasia, Principal Analyst at Canalys Omdia.

He noted that if India can match China’s production timeline, it would mark a new chapter in Apple’s global supply chain strategy.

This growth is strongly backed by the ‘Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme’ for electronics, which offers financial incentives to manufacturers for scaling up local production.

The development is also a big boost to the ‘Make in India’ initiative, which aims to position the country as a global manufacturing hub.

","Apple has recorded its fastest growth in iPhone production and exports from India in the first half of 2025, according to the Indian government. The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) celebrated the achievement on social media, calling it “record iPhone output from India’s orchard,” emphasizing India’s rising role in global tech manufacturing.

As per Canalys data, iPhone production in India jumped 53% YoY, reaching 23.9 million units between January and June 2025. This rapid ramp-up aligns with Apple’s efforts to reduce dependency on China, especially amid potential US tariffs on Chinese goods.

iPhone exports from India also surged by 53%, with the US now receiving 78% of Indian-made iPhones — a significant rise from 53% last year. Meanwhile, exports to other countries like the Netherlands, UAE, UK, and Japan declined.

Foxconn led production with over half of the iPhones exported, while Tata Group emerged as a strong contributor, now responsible for nearly 40% of iPhone exports. Analysts say this demonstrates Apple’s growing confidence in India.

The growth is largely supported by the government’s Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme and complements the ‘Make in India’ initiative, aiming to position India as a global manufacturing powerhouse.",Technology and Gadgets

Delhi Police and other quick-response authorities have launched search and evacuation operations, an official said.

This is the fourth such day this week when schools in the capital received bomb threats. Police, along with bomb disposal and dog squads, and the fire department are rushing to the different schools and initiating the evacuation process.

So far, bomb threats have been received at Maxfort Junior School and Guru Nanak School in Pitampura; six schools in Dwarka — St Thomas School, GD Goenka School, DIS Edge School, Modern International School, Dwarka International School and La Petite Montessori; Richmond School and Doon Public School in Paschim Vihar; six schools in Rohini — MRG School in Sector 3, Delhi Public School, Sovereign Public School and Heritage Public School in Sector 24, Delhi International Public School in Sector 9, Abhinav Public School in Sector 3 and The Heritage School; Summerfield International School in South Delhi. Several parents across Delhi chose to keep their children home on Friday after around 45 schools received bomb threats in the national capital via email for the fourth time this week.

""I did not send my son today. It is not that we are panicking, but after repeated incidents, it feels safer to wait things out,"" said Parmita Sharma, a parent whose child studies at Richmond School, Paschim Vihar.

Echoing similar sentiments, Vikram Singh, whose daughter attends Sovereign School in Rohini, said, ""Even if nothing serious is found, these hoax emails disturb the mental peace of children and parents.

""BJP controls all 4-engines of governance in Delhi, and is yet not able to provide any safety or security to our children! Shocking!"" she said in a post on X. Meanwhile, at least four private schools in Bengaluru on Friday morning received bomb threat emails, which turned out to be a hoax, police said.

An email titled ""Bombs inside the school"" was received by these schools at 7.24 am. The sender claimed to have placed several explosive devices within the classrooms of the respective schools.

""Hello. I am writing to let you know that I have placed several explosive devices (Trinitrotoluene) within school classrooms. The explosives are skillfully hidden, in black plastic bags,"" it stated.

The school authorities immediately alerted police, who reached the institutions concerned with the bomb disposal squads and anti-sabotage check teams, they said. The students and staff were immediately evacuated from the school premises, police said, adding no suspicious objects were found.

Hindustan Times,2020-06-07 00:00:00,"Coronavirus death toll hits 400,000 worldwide","New Delhi : The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic has claimed 400,000 lives globally since it surfaced in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and went on to ravage countries across the world that are now attempting to revive economies battered by the lockdowns imposed to curb the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus that causes the disease.

It took nearly four months for the death toll from the respiratory illness to reach the grim milestone of 100,000 deaths. As the virus spread from China – where it first originated in December 2019 – to find a strong foothold in Europe, the number of fatalities doubled to 200,000 in another 15 days.

The subsequent 100,000 deaths were added in 20 and 23 days, respectively, offering a glimmer of hope that many of the hot spots such as Spain, Italy, UK and France may have seen the worst.

Although European countries have begun to reopen businesses and industries, Latin America, particularly Brazil, has emerged as the latest epicentre of the viral disease, according to the World Health Organization.

In the United States– the hardest-hit country with 1.97 million cases and 111,658 deaths -- the numbers have continued to mount even as the rate of the infection appears to be slowing down.

Countries such as Mexico, Russia and India too are clocking thousands of daily new cases and hundreds more fatalities, driving part of the third wave of the pandemic after the first in China and the second in Europe and the US.

Till Saturday, 400,012 fatalities had been recorded from 6,916,826cases world over. It means the case fatality rate – defined as the proportion of deaths to total infections -- from Covid-19 stood at 5.8% on Saturday, according to data by worldometers.info.

At 246,472 cases, India on Saturday overtook Italy to become the country with the sixth-highest number of Covid-19 infections. However, with a death toll of 6,873 from the disease and a fatality rate of 2.8% till Saturday, it is significantly lower than the case fatality rate of other hard-hit nations such as the US (5.6%), UK (14.2%) and Italy (14.4%).

Experts say the number of deaths from the pandemic is a more accurate representation of the virus’ prevalence in a region instead of the number of infections, as a large percentage of Covid-19 cases are asymptomatic and are never officially reported.

“We know that the absolute number of deaths will go up with the increasing number of cases, but has there been a change in the proportion or case fatality rate?... And, if the case fatality rate is indeed going up, then that is a cause of concern,” Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital, had told HT.

At its early peak, the pandemic forced half of humanity into some form of lockdown and risked tipping economies into the deepest recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Governments from Africa to Europe to Asia are now focusing on reviving economies toward a post-pandemic normal. Seeking to revive the key tourism sectors in time for the summer season, the European Union said it could reopen borders to travellers from outside the region in early July, after some countries within the bloc reopened to European visitors.

Still, bleak numbers streamed in from Latin America. Brazil’s death toll rose to more than 35,211 on Saturday, the third-highest number after Britain and the US.

“The curve is steepening -- the sky is the limit,” Julio Croda, an infectious disease specialist and former Brazilian health ministry official, said.

Tolls are also rising sharply in Mexico, Peru and Ecuador. And in Chile, deaths have risen by more than 50% in the past week.

Russia reported 8,855 cases on Saturday, bringing the total number to 458,689, according to government data. The death toll increased by 197 to 5,725 people.

Fresh concerns have arisen over another wave of infections as lockdown restrictions are eased across the world. In South Korea, considered a success story for its quick response to control the virus’ spread, 51 new cases were reported on Saturday, mostly in the densely populated capital region, as the authorities scrambled to stem transmissions among low-income workers who can’t afford to stay home.

With no certain cure and a vaccine only in the development stage, scientists believe that lockdowns and social distancing measures are the only way to stop the virus.","As of June 6, 2020, the global death toll from COVID-19 reached 400,000, with over 6.9 million confirmed cases. The virus, first detected in Wuhan, China, rapidly spread across Europe, the US, and now Latin America, particularly Brazil, which has become a new epicenter. While Europe has begun reopening, nations like Mexico, India, and Russia are witnessing a surge in cases. Despite India's case count rising above Italy’s, its fatality rate remains lower at 2.8%. Experts highlight that the number of deaths, not just infections, gives a clearer picture of the pandemic's spread, as many cases remain unreported. With no vaccine yet, countries are cautiously easing lockdowns amid fears of renewed outbreaks. The U.S., UK, and Brazil lead in total deaths, while South Korea and others face sporadic spikes. The economic impact continues, with governments trying to strike a balance between recovery and public health safety.",Health and Wellness
The Telegraph,2025-07-18 00:00:00,ED arrests former Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel's son in liquor 'scam' case,"The sources said that Chaitanya Baghel was arrested under section 19 of the anti-money laundering as he was allegedly not cooperating during the searches. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Friday arrested Chaitanya Baghel, son of former Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, in an alleged liquor scam linked money laundering case, official sources said.

He was taken into custody under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) after fresh raids were carried out at his home in Bhilai town in Durg district. The father-son duo reside at the same place.

The sources said that Chaitanya Baghel was arrested under section 19 of the anti-money laundering as he was allegedly not cooperating during the searches that came about following receipt of fresh evidence in the case.

A heavy posse of police personnel was seen outside the house, even as some party supporters gathered.

The senior Baghel said it was Chaitanya's birthday today. Bhupesh Baghel, a senior Congress leader, posted a message on X saying the ED has come to his home on the last day of the assembly session when the issue of trees being felled for a coal mine project of the Adani group in Tamnar tehsil of Raigarh district was to be raised.

""Today is the last day of the state legislative (monsoon) session. The issue of trees being felled for Adani in Tamnar was scheduled to be raised (in the House). Saheb has sent ED to Bhilai Niwas,"" the message posted by his office said.

The senior Baghel earlier this month visited the tehsil and extended support to local villagers who have been protesting against tree felling for a coal mine project in the area.

The mine is allotted to Maharashtra State Power Generation Company Limited (MAHAGENCO), which has contracted the MDO (mine developer cum operator) to the Adani group.

The federal probe agency conducted similar raids against Chaitanya Baghel on March 10.

The ED earlier claimed that Chaitanya Baghel was suspected to be the ""recipient"" of the proceeds from the alleged liquor scam. It has been said that the ""scam"" resulted in a ""massive loss"" to the state exchequer and filled the pockets of the beneficiaries of a liquor syndicate with over Rs 2,100 crore.

In this case, the ED in January arrested former minister and Congress leader Kawasi Lakhma besides Anwar Dhebar, the elder brother of Raipur Mayor and Congress leader Aijaz Dhebar, former IAS officer Anil Tuteja, Indian Telecom Service (ITS) officer Arunpati Tripathi and some others as part of this investigation.

The alleged liquor scam in the central Indian state, according to the ED, was orchestrated between 2019 and 2022 when Chhattisgarh was governed by the Bhupesh Baghel-led Congress government.

Assets worth about Rs 205 crore of various accused have been attached by the agency as part of this investigation so far. In 2024, the Supreme Court quashed the ED's first ECIR (FIR) in this case, which was based on a complaint from the Income Tax Department.

The federal agency later filed a fresh case after it asked the Chhattisgarh EOW/ACB to file a fresh FIR against the accused based on material shared by the anti-money laundering agency.

The EOW/ACB registered the FIR on January 17 last year, about a month after the BJP defeated the incumbent Congress government in the 2023 assembly polls, and named 70 individuals and companies, including former excise minister Kawasi Lakhma, former chief secretary Vivek Dhand and others.

According to the ED, the alleged commission generated through the illegal sale of liquor was shared ""as per the directions from the highest political executives of the state.""","Chaitanya Baghel, son of former Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel, was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate on July 18, 2025, after raids at his Bhilai home. The arrest, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, is linked to a ₹2,160 crore liquor scam from 2019–2022. He faces a five-day ED custody for allegedly receiving proceeds from a parallel, illegal liquor distribution system, which the agency claims robbed the state exchequer.

The ED has probed into the case linked to a land deal in Haryana's Manesar-Shikohpur (now sector 83) in Gurugram. The deal was made by Skylight Hospitality Pvt Ltd, for which Vadra was a director in February 2008. It purchased 3.5 acre of land in Shikohpur from Onkareshwar Properties at a price of Rs 7.5 crore.

The plot was mutated in favour of Skylight the next day and the title of the land was reportedly transferred to Vadra within 24 hours.

About four years later, in September 2012, the company sold the land to realty major DLF for Rs 58 crore. At the time, Haryana was governed by the Congress party led by Bhupinder Singh Hooda.

The land deal was controversial when IAS officer Ashok Khemka, then posted as the director general of Land Consolidation and Land Records-cum-Inspector-General of Registration of Haryana, cancelled the mutation of this categorising the transaction as violative of state consolidation act and some related procedures in October 2012.

An FIR was filed in 2018 against Hooda, Vadra, DLF and Onkareshwar Properties on charges of alleged criminal conspiracy, cheating, fraud and forgery under the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

'Political vendetta'

Vadra has denied wrongdoing and has said the case was a ""political vendetta"" against him and his family that comprises former Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi and his wife Congress leader and Wayanad MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.

The ED is investigating Vadra in two other cases including one against UK-based arms consultant Sanjay Bhandari and a land deal in Rajasthan's Bikaner. ","The Enforcement Directorate filed its first chargesheet against Robert Vadra in a money laundering case linked to a Gurugram land deal, also attaching 43 properties worth ₹37 crore. The case involves fraudulent purchase and resale of land in Shikohpur, Haryana for massive profits, with allegations of forgery, cheating, and use of political influence. Rahul Gandhi called it a politically motivated witch hunt, asserting his family’s innocence. The chargesheet names Vadra, his company Skylight Hospitality, and others; the court has yet to take cognizance of the case.",Politics
The Telegraph,2025-07-18 00:00:00,"IMD issues seven-day alert for Bengal: Thunderstorms, gusty winds and heavy rainfall likely across multiple districts","In Kolkata, Friday’s forecast includes thunderstorms and gusty winds of 30–40 kmph, along with lightning in one or two places. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a seven-day forecast for south and north Bengal from July 18 to July 25, warning of thunderstorms, gusty winds, lightning, and heavy rainfall across several districts.

While the early days bring isolated thunderstorms, the latter half of the week is expected to see intensified activity, especially in coastal areas and northern hilly districts.

In Kolkata, Friday’s forecast includes thunderstorms and gusty winds of 30–40 kmph, along with lightning in one or two places.

South 24 Parganas is likely to see thunderstorms on the first two days and heavy rainfall forecast on July 24 and 25. East Midnapore is expected to experience thunderstorms during the first three days, with rainfall resuming later in the week.

In West Midnapore, Jhargram, Purulia, and Bankura, thunderstorms are expected in the first three days, followed by a brief dry spell and a return of rainfall on July 24.

North 24 Parganas is likely to see thunderstorms and heavy rainfall on July 22 and 23. West Bardhaman is also under a thunderstorm alert through the first three days.

Birbhum, Murshidabad, and Nadia are forecast to have isolated thunderstorms at intervals. IMD warnings point to possible damage to crops, waterlogging, damage to kutcha houses and roads, lightning hazards, and reduced visibility during intense rain.

Advisories urged people to avoid waterlogged areas, secure livestock, stay indoors during storms, and avoid handling fertilizers and pesticides during this period.

There are no alerts for fishermen off the Bengal coast.

In north Bengal, districts such as Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar, Coochbehar, North and South Dinajpur, and Malda are expected to remain wet throughout the week.

Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar may receive 7–11 cm of rainfall, along with thunderstorms, gusty winds, and lightning during the weekend, with Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri expected to receive very heavy rainfall (12–20 cm).

Alipurduar, Kalimpong, Coochbehar, and North Dinajpur are also under heavy rain alerts for the early part of the week. Kalimpong is under continuous heavy rainfall alerts during the weekend.

Advisories for north Bengal focus on traffic regulation, taking shelter during intense rain, and avoiding landslide-prone zones.

The Telegraph,2025-07-18 00:00:00,Three elephants crushed by express train in Bengal as herd watches on,"The collision took place on the Kharagpur-Tatanagar section when a herd of around 30 elephants, believed to be from the Dalma forest, was crossing. Three elephants, including two calves, were killed on Thursday night after being struck by a speeding express train near Banstala railway station in Bengal’s Paschim Midnapore district, according to local police officials.

The collision took place on the Kharagpur-Tatanagar section when a herd of approximately 30 elephants, believed to have migrated from the Dalma forest in neighbouring Jharkhand, tried to cross the railway tracks.

The Janshatabdi Express hit the trio. “It was difficult to go near the carcasses for some time, as the herd of 30 elephants was passing through the area,” a police officer at the scene told PTI.

In India rail lines often cut through migratory paths of elephants.

Last year, the All India Loco Running Staff Association (AILRSA) issued a public statement highlighting the technical limitations faced by train operators during such incidents.

According to a blog entry published on their official website, the association pointed out that even if emergency brakes are applied, a fully loaded train can only come to a stop after travelling at least 1.6 kilometers.

“Trains cannot be stopped abruptly upon encountering elephants crossing the tracks,” the blog noted, stressing the physical constraints of braking systems in high-speed and freight trains. The AILRSA has called for systemic preventive measures, rather than placing the burden on train drivers alone. In search of solutions

Among the solutions proposed by the loco-pilots’ association is the installation of subways and the rollout of the Intrusion Detection System (IDS)-an AI-powered technology aimed at alerting rail authorities when elephants or other animals are near the tracks.

Current methods in use, such as whistling and braking, have been described by AILRSA as largely ineffective.

A coexistence contrast

The fatal collision near Banstala comes barely a week after a contrasting incident in Jharkhand illustrated the possibility of harmonious intervention.

On the Ranchi-Koderma line, a coal-laden goods train was halted for over two hours to allow a pregnant elephant to safely deliver her calf on the tracks between Barkakana and Hazaribag stations, just last week. The Eastern Central Railways, under whose jurisdiction the event occurred, suspended train movement until both the mother and calf had moved away safely.

The incident drew widespread praise from animal rights groups and railway authorities, who viewed it as a successful case of coordination between human systems and wildlife needs. ","Three elephants, including two calves, were killed after being hit by the Janshatabdi Express near Banstala in West Bengal’s Paschim Midnapore. The herd of 30 elephants was crossing from Dalma forest. The AILRSA urged AI-based preventive systems like IDS, citing braking limitations. A recent Jharkhand incident showed a successful intervention.",National News
Indian express ,2025-07-18 00:00:00,"‘Full access’ into Indonesia after pact, India deal ‘along the same lines’, says Trump | Business News - The Indian Express ","As Indian negotiators engage with the US in extended talks for an interim deal this week, US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said that the US has signed a trade deal with Indonesia, opening the country to trade with America and that a agreement “on the same lines” is being worked on with India.","A bad deal—especially one that removes India’s tariffs without reciprocal benefits—could be worse than no deal at all. India must therefore negotiate transparently, guard against one-sided outcomes, and not succumb to pressure for quick, symbolic agreements that compromise long-term economic interests, the think tank said.

The Indian Express had reported that agriculture has been a major sticking point in the negotiations, particularly because India has adopted an unwavering stance on this sector. The US maintains that the August 1 cut-off date is not a new deadline but an outer limit for countries to “speed things up”, and that this strategy has helped bring trading partners such as the European Union on board.

Story continues below this ad

The threat from the Trump administration is that if the August 1 deadline is not adhered to, those countries revert to the April 2 tariff levels. Most of them are minor trading partners of the US and are likely outside America’s 18 key trading relationships that account for 95 per cent of the country’s trade deficit.

The Telegraph,2025-07-18 00:00:00,Kay Kay Menon shines as RAW agent Himmat Singh in ‘Special Ops’ S2: ‘An absolute star’,"Also starring Tota Roychowdhury and Saiyami Kher, Season 2 of the Neeraj Pandey-created show premiered on JioHotstar on Friday. Kay Kay Menon’s Special Ops Season 2 garnered rave reviews following its July 18 premiere on JioHotstar, with many fans heaping praise on the actor for bringing RAW agent Himmat Singh to life with his acting.

A fan said she woke up at 5am to finish daily chores early to make time for binge watching the second season of Special Ops. Another applauded Menon’s performance in the spy thriller but called the fight scenes ‘pathetic’ and ‘unrealistic’. Himmat reassembles his trusted squad, including characters played by Karan Tacker, Saiyami Kher, Vinay Pathak, Muzammil Ibrahim and Meher Vij, to take on a rising threat of cyber terrorism in Season 2.

The ensemble cast also features Prakash Raj, Tota Roy Choudhury, Dalip Tahil and Gautami Kapoor. Tahir Raj Bhasin plays the antagonist in this season. Sharing a thumbnail from the series featuring Kay Kay Menon, a fan tweeted, “Himmat is back.” Heaping praise on Kay Kay Menon, another fan wrote, “@kaykaymenon02 u are an absolute star... watching #SpecialOPS and Sir u have truly killed it. Thank you.” Special Ops debuted in March 2020, shortly after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, and quickly became a fan-favourite. Created by Neeraj Pandey — known for acclaimed thrillers like A Wednesday!, Baby and Special 26 — the eight-episode first season was praised for its gripping narrative, tight direction and powerful performances.

Hooked from the start, a fan shared that Special Ops grabbed attention right from the opening scene. Sharing stills from the show, another X user wrote, “Thanks @kaykaymenon02

for the series. Der aaye paar durust aaye.” The original season followed intelligence officer Himmat Singh as he led a covert mission to capture a terrorist mastermind, concluding a 19-year pursuit. In November 2021, a prequel spin-off titled Special Ops 1.5: The Himmat Story explored the origins of Himmat Singh across four episodes.","Special Ops Season 2 premiered on JioHotstar on July 18, earning praise for Kay Kay Menon’s return as RAW agent Himmat Singh. Created by Neeraj Pandey, the season tackles cyber terrorism with a strong ensemble cast. Fans lauded Menon’s performance, though some criticized unrealistic action scenes.

Dear reader,

So here we are, still breathing, debating, and doomscrolling. Honestly, there were many points in the past few weeks where some of us thought, quite realistically and plausibly, we might not see this day after watching two nuclear powers seemingly tell us, in Gen Z lingo, “hold my tea and watch this”. The four-day India-Pakistan military exchange has now settled into that comfortable space in our cultural memory somewhere between “remember when that happened?” and “wait, what happened again?”

","In May 2025, a tense four-day military standoff between nuclear powers India and Pakistan brought the world to the edge.

The 50-share NSE Nifty dropped 143.05 points or 0.57 per cent to close at 24,968.40.

Analysts said investors turned cautious over banking stocks in response to Axis Bank's latest financial results, which fell short of market expectations. Among Sensex firms, Axis Bank tumbled the most by 5.24 per cent after it reported a 3 per cent dip in its June quarter consolidated net profit at Rs 6,243.72 crore, impacted by the implementation of changes in non-performing assets and loan upgrade policy.

Devarsh Vakil, Head of Prime Research, HDFC Securities, said Axis Bank's latest financial results fell short of market expectations.

""Notably, Axis Bank's GDR tumbled 4.8 per cent to USD 64.30 on Thursday, following a deterioration in the bank's asset quality during the June quarter,"" he said.

Among blue-chip bank stocks, Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and State Bank of India ended lower.

Following the decline in bank stocks, the BSE Bankex ended 1.33 per cent lower at 62,741.65.

Bharat Electronics, Bharti Airtel, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Titan and Eternal were also among the laggards from the Sensex pack.

However, Bajaj Finance, Tata Steel, ICICI Bank, HCL Tech and Infosys were among the gainers.

Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) offloaded equities worth Rs 3,694.31 crore on Thursday, according to exchange data.

In Asian markets, South Korea's Kospi and Japan's Nikkei 225 index settled lower, while Shanghai's SSE Composite index and Hong Kong's Hang Seng ended in positive territory.

European markets were trading with gains. The US markets ended higher on Thursday.

Global oil benchmark Brent crude climbed 0.92 per cent to USD 70.16 a barrel.

On Thursday, the Sensex dropped 375.24 points or 0.45 per cent to settle at 82,259.24. The Nifty ended lower by 100.60 points or 0.40 per cent to 25,111.45.","Sensex fell 501 points and Nifty dropped 143 on Friday, marking a second day of losses amid foreign fund outflows and banking stock selloff.

When Kamal formed the party in February 2018, he positioned it as an alternative to both the DMK and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), much like superstar Vijay is attempting now with his Tamilaga Vetri Kazhagam.

His elevation to the Supreme Court was a rare and hard-won victory for judicial merit—a welcome aberration in a system often clouded by opacity and executive pressure.

It came after a prolonged standoff led by former Supreme Court judge Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman, then a member of the Supreme Court’s five-judge collegium for appointments to the Supreme Court. For nearly 22 months, Justice Nariman stalled judicial appointments, insisting that both Justice Oka, then Chief Justice of the Karnataka High Court and the seniormost judge across all High Courts, and Justice Akil Kureshi, then Chief Justice of the Tripura High Court and second in seniority, be elevated to the Supreme Court.

By Nariman’s retirement in August 2021, the Supreme Court had eight vacancies against a sanctioned strength of 34 judges. After his retirement, the collegium headed by Chief Justice N.V. Ramana went ahead with Justice Oka’s name but chose not to pursue Kureshi’s. “The government would’ve been extremely unhappy if Kureshi’s name was pushed,” a retired Chief Justice of a High Court told this author.

","Justice Abhay Oka’s retirement marks the end of a judicial career symbolizing merit and resilience.

Nehru was not just a political negotiator, a policymaker, or a man of high politics. He was also the political leader who imbibed the Gandhian spirit of nonviolent courage and truth-telling, and displayed it in ample measure when mass violence broke out during Partition.

The story begins with Nehru’s interview to the press at the Dum Dum airport (Formally known as Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport) on November 2, 1946:

“I have never been so silent for so long when I felt so strongly as I have been in the last few days. If anybody has mistaken my silence, he does not know me. What has happened in other parts of India and more so in Eastern Bengal has been so ghastly that it is even sufficient to wake up the dead. I am not dead; I am very much alive.”

Though their entrance and worship took place amid heavy police security, it was nevertheless a symbolic end to centuries of caste-based discrimination. However, there was little scope for the Dalit community to rejoice, as soon after the event they faced social and economic boycott; and two months down the line, a visit to the village revealed that the environment there is still tense. Though on the surface there is a reluctant acceptance of the new development, there remains a very perceptible underlying resentment among the other villagers, that puts paid to West Bengal’s long-standing boast of not being a casteist society.

Not being allowed admittance to the Gidheshwar temple, which stands just a few hundred metres from Das Para, the locality where the Dalit villagers stay, had been a long festering wound for the community. Of the 2,000 families living in Gidhagram, only the 130 families belonging to the Das sub-caste category were denied access to the temple. This discrimination that had apparently persisted for centuries seemed to have finally ended when after several meetings involving the district administration and the villagers, five Dalits entered the temple under heavy police security and offered prayers to the deity.

More surprising than the fact that such casteist discrimination persisted for so long unknown to most people in the State, was the backlash that followed the development. For nearly a month the residents of Das Para found themselves socially ostracised, and an influential section of the village also called for an “economic boycott” of the Das community. “Our happiness at being allowed to pray in the temple was marred by the ostracism that followed. However, the situation has improved since then, and people are coming round to accepting us in the temple,” said a resident of Das Para.

","On March 13, 2025, Dalit families in Gidhagram, West Bengal, entered the Gidheshwar Shiv temple for the first time in 300 years, ending a long-standing caste-based ban. Their symbolic victory, however, triggered social and economic boycotts, exposing the deep-rooted casteism beneath West Bengal’s image of social equality.",Human Interest
The Times Of India,2017-05-21 00:00:00,"In 2004, UPA replaced Salve with Pak's ICJ lawyer for Enron arbitration","There is a bit of history to the hyped fight between Harish Salve (L) and Khawar Qureshi.
NEW DELHI: There is a bit of history to the hyped fight between two legal titans — Harish Salve for India and Khawar Qureshi for Pakistan — in ICJ on May 15 in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case .
Salve’s arguments for India on May 15 had a connect with the judges on ICJ bench, which unanimously rejected Qureshi’s arguments to stall India’s attempts to save Jadhav from possible execution.
To mat Qureshi, Salve had charged India Re 1 . More than 15 years ago, there was a curious turn to events when India was forced to face arbitration at an international tribunal in the US initiated by Enron over the closure of Dabhol power project.
Millions of dollars were at stake for India. Salve, who had quit as solicitor general of India in November 2002, was retained as India’s counsel at the arbitration tribunal. In 2004, the UPA government came to power as also a new team of law officers headed by attorney general Milon Banerjee. To manage the highstake arbitration over Dabhol against Enron, the government chose Fox and Mandal law firm.
Union government sources said Salve was sounded out whether he would continue as India’s counsel in the arbitration proceedings. Salve confirmed and informed the new government that he would continue to charge a concessional fee of Rs one lakh per day’s hearing in the US-based tribunal.
Read this story in Gujarati
However, all of a sudden there was a change of decision and Fox and Mandal was informed to hire Khawar Qureshi. India lost both ways, the case to Enron and a lot of money that was paid to Qureshi as legal fees.
Salve confirmed to TOI that he had agreed to conduct the case for India in the tribunal despite change of government. “It was a professional decision to defend India in the tribunal. But, I learnt from media reports later that Qureshi was hired and I could become his deputy. That was not what I was told by the government. So I had decided to keep away wishing India the best.”
Salve refused to get drawn any further into the controver sy steadfastly refusing to divulge any more details of how he was replaced by Qureshi in 2004.
An article from 2004 in 'The Lawyer', states that Serle Court chambers' lawyer Khawar Qureshi had been appointed as counsel for the government of India. A host of UK firms had been invited to take India's case. A spokesperson from the previous law firm had said: ""Following the appointment of the new attorney general, the entire legal team, including the Indian advisers, was replaced.""
","The legal rivalry between Harish Salve and Khawar Qureshi gained attention during the Kulbhushan Jadhav case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on May 15, where Salve successfully argued India’s case, charging only ₹1. This confrontation had historical roots going back to 2004 during India’s arbitration with Enron over the Dabhol power project. Despite stepping down as Solicitor General in 2002, Salve had agreed to represent India in the U.S.-based tribunal, charging a reduced fee of ₹1 lakh per day. However, when the UPA government came to power, the legal team was reshuffled under Attorney General Milon Banerjee. The government unexpectedly replaced Salve with Khawar Qureshi, hiring the UK-based lawyer through the Fox and Mandal firm. India eventually lost the case and paid substantial legal fees. Salve, feeling sidelined without prior communication, chose not to assist as Qureshi’s deputy. He confirmed his professional readiness to defend India but declined to delve further into the matter. The episode reflects both diplomatic missteps and professional tensions in high-stakes international arbitration.",Politics

The BJP’s candidate from Surat, Gujarat, was declared elected unopposed after all other contenders withdrew or had their nominations rejected. Over 16.5 lakh voters in the constituency were thus denied the chance to cast their vote.

A petition currently before the Supreme Court has challenged the legality of declaring unopposed candidates as winners without a single vote being cast. The main argument being that the voters do not get a chance to exercise the choice of “None of the Above” (NOTA).

The deliberations in the court have widened the scope of the debate. They now touch upon the very relevance of NOTA—whether it holds any real value, especially in uncontested elections where voters have no choice at all, or whether its limited uptake so far reflects its ineffectiveness as a democratic instrument.

The Tribune,2013-02-08 00:00:00,4-nation gas pipeline plan gets fresh push  Cabinet nod to special purpose vehicle to speed up  Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India project ,"New Delhi, February 7
Aiming to speed up implementation of the ambitious Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) natural gas pipeline, the Union Cabinet today approved the setting up of a special purpose vehicle to build the 1,680-km pipeline that terminates at Fazilka in Punjab.

Tapi Ltd, the Dubai-based SPV, would undertake the feasibility study and design work for the pipeline, hunt for a consortium leader to build the $ 9 billion project, operate it, arrange for finances and work to ensure safe delivery of gas.

At the Cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the SPV was given the go-ahead and permitted Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL) to join it as India's representative.

It was announced officially that TAPI Ltd initially requires $ 20 million contribution, with each of the four participating countries funding $ 5 million. GAIL being a Navratna Company, is empowered to make an investment of this level for India.

TAPI Ltd is being formed for the project as multinational corporations are unwilling to participate in the project without a share in Turkmenistan's rich gas fields. The project had got stuck since India was not agreeable to the suggestion by the other three that each country build the pipeline on its own and operate it.

At a meeting of the steering committee last September, Turkmenistan suggested formation of an SPV to put the project after all parties reaffirmed their commitment and intention to fast track it since it also a symbol of regional cooperation.

India joined the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (TAP) Project in April, 2008, two years after the Union Cabinet gave its ‘in principle’ approval. Thereafter, the name of the project stood amended to Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) Gas Pipeline Project.

The pipeline originates and runs 144 km in Turkmenistan, passes 735 km through Afghanistan and travels 800 km in Pakistan en route India.

Last May, the four countries signed the gas sale and purchase agreement. The 1,680 km pipeline will carry 90 million cubic metres a day (mmcmd) of gas and is scheduled to become operational in 2018 and supply gas over a 30-year period. India and Pakistan will get 38 mmcmd each, while the remaining 14 mmcmd will be supplied to Afghanistan. TAPI will carry gas from Turkmenistan's Galkynysh field, known earlier as South Yoiotan Osman that is known to hold gas reserves of 16 trillion cubic feet.

Turkmenistan, which holds more than 4 per cent of the world's natural gas reserves, signed pacts last May to sell gas last to India and Pakistan through the 1,680-km pipeline at the Caspian Sea resort of Avaza in Turkmenistan.

The Tribune,2013-02-09 00:00:00,"Punjab not convinced with SC mediators on tax sops Apex court notice to Centre, J&K, Uttarakhand & HP on Punjab’s case","New Delhi, February 8
The mediators, appointed by the Supreme Court to find a solution to Punjab’s complaint against the Centre for extending tax sops to industrial units in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, today informed the court that their efforts had gone in vain.

After going through their report submitted in a sealed cover, a Bench of Justices CK Prasad and FMI Kalifulla said the mediation had not been successful and “no settlement” had been reached on the issue.

As a result, the Bench issued notice to the Centre and the three states seeking their response to Punjab’s suit within eight weeks.

Appearing for the Centre, Additional Solicitor General Mohan Jain said Punjab’s suit taking exception to the duty exemption packages offered to new industrial units in the three hill states for 10 years had become infructuous.

The packages offered to industries in Jammu and Kashmir through an order on June 14, 2002 and to those in HP and Uttarakhand on January 67, 2003 had ceased to exist at the conclusion of 10 years, he contended.

However, Punjab said it had filed an amended suit objecting to the December 12, 2010 circular issued by the Centre offering continued excise duty exemption for 10 years from the date of commencement of commercial production even by plants that were added or upgraded by the industrial units to step up output.

The Centre could not have enlarged the scope of the 2003 notification which “is untenable in law” and “is violative of Articles 301 to 303” of the Constitution, besides being contrary to the Union Finance Minister’s assurance to Punjab that tax exemption would be applicable only to those units that had carried out additions/modifications prior to the cut-off date.

Unconvinced, the Bench said Punjab “is a rich state” and was not expected to compete with states like HP and J&K where the level of unemployment was quite high.

“How can Punjab compare itself with the hilly states? We don’t know who decides to file this kind of suits. If the Centre wants to help Himachal what is wrong in it,” the Bench remarked.

In the amended suit, Punjab said continuation of the tax sops to the three states was “detrimental to the economy of Punjab and will have a cascading effect on the growth of industrial units as it will not only discourage new units from coming to Punjab but will also lead to transposition of existing industrial units from Punjab to neighbouring states where tax concessions are available resulting in unemployment and loss of government revenue.”

In a chart, Punjab said the Centre’s discriminatory tax sops to the hilly states had already resulted in as many as 274 industrial units involving an investment of Rs 3,675 crore moving out its territory.

Ludhiana was the worst hit as investment worth Rs 2,027 crore moved out of the district with 33 units packing up. Following are the figures for other areas: Mohali (Rs 742.5 crore), Gurdaspur/Batala (461 crore), Hoshiarpur (Rs 66 crore) Patiala (Rs 60 crore) and Malerkotla (Rs 50 crore).

On April 25, 2011, the SC had appointed senior advocates JP Singh Sadhna Ramachandran as mediators to resolve the problem. It had then taken note of the fact that the Punjab Chief Minister had made representations to the Prime Minister as well as Union Ministers for Finance and Commerce and Industry, drawing their attention to the fact that the incentives granted to the adjacent states were having an adverse impact on Punjab.

The Punjab Vidhan Sabha also passed a resolution on April 1, 2003 urging the Centre to provide similar incentives to the industrial units in Punjab.

The Union Commerce and Industry Minister wrote to the state government subsequently stating that “it is not possible” to extend such benefits to Punjab.

Punjab’s stand

Punjab says the Centre’s “discriminatory tax sops” to the hill states resulted in 274 units, involving an investment of `3,675 crore, moving out of its territory; Ludhiana is the worst hit with 33 units packing up

A few days ago, neighbourhoods such as Andrews Ganj in South Delhi and Indira Camp in Taimoor Nagar, South-East Delhi, witnessed extensive demolition drives led by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD). In Taimoor Nagar, Himanshu, a local resident, sifted through the debris of what was once his home.

As he searched for scraps of iron to sell, he was wary of speaking to the media. “Earlier, we shared our problems, but later saw that parts where we criticised the government were removed. After that, we stopped talking,” he said. A college student who also works to support his family, Himanshu, said they had lived there for 50 years. “We’re originally from Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh, but I was born here.

Told through the eyes of a young girl hoping to buy a goldfish and seeking help from adult strangers who ignore her, the film was compassionate in its portrayal of the gradual slipping away of hope and innocence. The winner, Jafar Panahi, a young Iranian director with a perpetual cheeky grin on his face, accepted the award at a time when dissent in Iranian cinema was not widespread.

Bulldozers have arrived without warning, stalls have been razed, and livelihoods—built over decades—have been wiped out in minutes. Since the BJP’s Rekha Gupta assumed office as Chief Minister of Delhi, vendors say evictions have intensified dramatically. According to the National Association of Street Vendors of India (NASVI), the capital is home to over 2 lakh street vendors. Yet, since April 28, more than 25,000 of them have been evicted under what authorities are calling a sweeping “cleanliness mission.”

Many of those affected hold valid Certificates of Vending (COV), issued by municipal corporations, but have still seen their goods confiscated and stalls demolished. The bulldozer has become a familiar and feared sight. In May, the Delhi government launched a 20-day city-wide sanitation campaign. The Chief Minister said that, for the first time under a “triple-engine” government, officials from the Delhi government and the municipal body were working in coordination to make Delhi “clean and beautiful”. Encroachments, debris, and garbage, she said, would no longer be tolerated on public pathways, parks, or markets.

Alongside this, the Delhi Police launched a special drive targeting so-called “illegal encroachments.” Officials claim the effort is intended to reclaim public spaces and ease traffic congestion by targeting illegally parked autorickshaws, private taxis, e-rickshaws, and street vendors. But for thousands of working-class families, these drives have meant sudden unemployment, rising debt, and growing despair. Activists and legal experts argue that the evictions violate the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014, which mandates protection, consultation, and rehabilitation—none of which, vendors say, have been offered.

The jail witnessed a hanging after 24 years. Guru was the seventh man hanged inside the prison since 1981. Guru’s is the second hanging of a terror-related convict in three months, signalling what is seen as a firm resolve of the ruling UPA combine to deal with terror-related cases. Ajmal Kasab, one of the 26/11 Mumbai attackers, was hanged at Pune’s Yerwada Jail on November 21, 2012. Like last time, official confirmation of the hanging was made public only after it was carried out. “We don’t announce our steps... Law and justice is taking its course,” Union Home Secretary RK Singh said. Nine persons were killed in the December 13, 2001, attack on Parliament House when five heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists drove into the complex and opened fire. There were about 100 MPs, including then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his Cabinet members, in the building at the time of the attack. All the terrorists were shot dead. Guru was convicted of plotting the attack, which had triggered one of the biggest deployments of the Indian Army along its border with Pakistan, bringing the nuclear-armed neighbours to the brink of war. A final call on Guru’s mercy petition had been pending since 2006 when his wife had petitioned the President. The Supreme Court had handed out the death sentence to Afzal Guru in 2005. However, the execution, originally scheduled for October 2006, was stayed, once the mercy petition was filed.

A fourth-year mechanical engineering student at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur was found dead inside his hostel room on Friday morning, marking the fourth unnatural student death at the institute in seven months.

The student, identified as 21-year-old Ritam Mondal, a resident of Kolkata, was discovered hanging in Room 203 of Rajendra Prasad (RP) Hall.

According to police, Ritam had not responded to his friends’ repeated knocks in the morning. Alarmed, they alerted hostel authorities, who then informed the local Hijli police outpost.

Police and campus security broke open the door around 11.30am and found Ritam hanging. He was rushed to the BC Roy Hospital on campus, but was declared dead on arrival.

“We have registered a case of unnatural death and launched an investigation. Prima facie, it appears to be a suicide, but we are awaiting the post-mortem report for confirmation,” said a police officer.

The autopsy will be videographed, and the student's family has been informed, the officer added.

Ritam’s death adds to a series of student fatalities in India’s most prestigious engineering institutions.

On January 12, Shaon Malik, a third-year electrical engineering student, died by suicide. His body was discovered by his parents during a visit to the campus.

On April 20, Aniket Walker, a 22-year-old final-year student of Ocean Engineering from Maharashtra, was found hanging in his room at JC Bose Hall.

Mohammad Asif Qamar, a third-year B.Tech student from Bihar, was found dead in his room in Madan Mohan Malviya Hall on May 4.

In October 2022, Faizan Ahmed, a third-year mechanical engineering student from Assam, was found dead in his hostel room. It was declared a case of suicide.

But the Calcutta High Court ordered the exhumation of Faizan’s body in 2023 for a second post-mortem, after a petition by his family.

The re-autopsy revealed gunshot and stab wounds, leading forensic experts to conclude that the death was homicidal.

The court criticised IIT-Kharagpur for failing to document Faizan’s injuries or act on ragging complaints he had allegedly made earlier.

A special investigation team was formed and narco-analysis tests were cleared for suspects. The case is still under investigation.

IIT-Kharagpur recently announced the formation of a 10-member mental health task force comprising psychologists, legal and police officials, counsellors, educationists, and alumni.

The committee is tasked with identifying structural gaps and offering expert recommendations within three months.

The panel will also “assess the current mental health ecosystem” and engage with all stakeholders, including students and faculty, said the institute.

The institute also decided to file a first information report for every student death on campus after the Supreme Court questioned whether an FIR had been registered in the Qamar case.

Among the other interventions launched is the “Campus Mothers” programme — a support initiative that ropes in women faculty and staff members to act as informal emotional mentors to students.

These volunteers are being trained in basic counselling and communication skills to serve as accessible support figures for distressed students.

But student organisations and mental health advocates argue that the current institutional responses remain reactive and lack long-term vision.

Many have called for structural reforms, more empathetic campus cultures, and increased investment in psychological services.

Student deaths have reignited a national debate about the mental health infrastructure across elite institutions in India.

Data shared in Parliament last year showed that between 2005 and 2024, 127 suicides were reported across India’s IITs — with IIT Madras (26), IIT Kanpur (18), IIT Kharagpur (14), and IIT Guwahati (13) topping the list.

From January 2018 to March 2023, at least 33 students died by suicide across IITs.

Experts say the reasons for student suicides range from academic stress, peer pressure, and isolation, to caste discrimination, poor faculty-student engagement, relationship issues, and concerns over placements and future career paths.","A fourth-year IIT Kharagpur student, Ritam Mondal, was found hanging in his hostel room at Rajendra Prasad Hall on Friday, marking the fourth unnatural student death at the institute this year.

The Times Of India,2023-08-13 00:00:00,Independence Day 2023: PM Modi to equal Manmohan Singh’s record of hoisting national flag for 10 times,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi hoisted the national flag from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the 75th anniversary of Independence Day on August 15, 2022. File photo
NEW DELHI: When Prime Minister Narendra Modi hoists the national flag on the 77th Independence Day on Tuesday from the ramparts of the historic Red Fort, he will create a record of sorts. He will equal his immediate predecessor Manmohan Singh’s record of hoisting the tricolour for 10 consecutive times.
Besides sharing the record with Manmohan Singh of hoisting the national flag for 10 consecutive times, Modi will also become an Indian PM to raise the tricolour for third highest time, a record which he will share with his immediate predecessor.
1x1 polls

So far, India has seen 15 PMs. Out of these 15 PMs, 13 have hoisted the national flag at the Red Fort. Two PMs – Gulzarilal Nanda and Chandra Shekhar – did not get an opportunity to hoist the tricolour on Independence Day.
The record for hoisting the maximum number of times rests with first PM Jawaharlal Nehru. Between August 15, 1947 – when he hoisted the tricolour for the very first time – and May 27, 1964 – when he died in harness – Nehru raised the national flag for 17 consecutive times.
Nehru’s daughter Indira Gandhi holds the record of hoisting the national flag for second highest number of times. She hoisted it 16 times, just one short of her father. However, it was not consecutive as in the case of Nehru. She achieved the feat in two different stints separated by a gap of about four years.
Hoisting National Flag by PMs at the Red Fort-1

Indira hoisted the national flag for 11 consecutive times during her first stint as PM from January 24, 1966 to March 24, 1977. She hoisted the flag for five consecutive times between January 14, 1980 and October 31, 1984.
Till now, Manmohan Singh, who was the PM of the Congress-led UPA government for continuous 10 years, holds the record of hoisting the tricolour for 10 times between May 22, 2004 and May 26, 2014.
However, on the 76th anniversary of Independence Day this year, incumbent PM Narendra Modi will equal Manmohan Singh’s record and will also become a PM to to do the honours for 10 consecutive times from May 26, 2014 onwards.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the PM of the BJP-led NDA government raised the tricolour for six consecutive times. Though he was sworn in twice as PM, he could not get a chance to hoist the flag in his first stint between May 16, 1996 and June 1, 1996.
Vajpayee raised the tricolour for six consecutive times in his second term as PM from March 19, 1998 to May 22, 2004.
Rajiv Gandhi, who was the PM from October 31, 1984 – the day his mother Indira Gandhi was assassinated – to December 2, 1989, hoisted the national flag for five consecutive times.
Rajiv Gandhi’s record of hoisting the flag for five consecutive times was later equalled by another Congress PM P V Narasimha Rao who held the coveted post from June 21, 1991 to May 16, 1996.
Two PMs – Lal Bahadur Shastri and Morarji Desai – hoisted the flag for two times each. Shastri raised the flag on two occasions between June 9, 1964 – when he was sworn in as the PM – and January 11, 1966 – when he died at Tashkent in the erstwhile USSR.
Morarji Desai, the first non-Congress PM of independent India and who succeeded Indira Gandhi after a spell of Emergency, hoisted the flag twice between March 24, 1977 and July 28, 1979, when his government fell.
Four PMs – Charan Singh, V P Singh, H D Deve Gowda and I K Gujral – hoisted the flag only once each.
Charan Singh was the PM from July 28, 1979 to January 14, 1980. He took over from Morarji Desai and was succeeded by Indira Gandhi.
V P Singh, who succeeded Rajiv Gandhi on December 2, 1989 was the PM till November 10, 1990, when his government also lost majority and fell.
Vajpayee had taken over as the PM from Narasimha Rao on May 16, 1996. However, he could not prove his government’s majority and his government fell. He was succeeded by H D Deve Gowda on June 1, 1996. Gowda hoisted the flag in 1996 and had to step down from his post on April 21, 1997.
Gowda was succeeded by I K Gujral on April 21, 1997 and was on the chair till March 19, 1998. He hoisted the national flag once in 1997.
Two PMs – Gulzarilal Nanda and Chandra Shekhar – did not get a chance to hoist the tricolour.
Gulzarilal Nanda twice became the PM. His first stint was from May 27, 1964 – on the death of Nehru – to June 9, 1964. He became the PM for the second time from January 11, 1966 – on the death of Lal Bahadur Shastri – till January 24, 1966.
Chandra Shekhar was PM from November 10, 1990 to June 21, 1991 and he also could not hoist the national flag even once.","On the 77th Independence Day (August 15, 2023), Prime Minister Narendra Modi matched Dr. Manmohan Singh’s record of hoisting the national flag 10 consecutive times from the Red Fort, a symbolic act on India’s Independence Day. This achievement places Modi as the third most frequent flag-hoisting PM, behind Jawaharlal Nehru, who did it 17 times, and Indira Gandhi, who hoisted it 16 times in two separate terms.

India has had 15 Prime Ministers, of whom 13 have had the honour of flag-hoisting at the Red Fort. Gulzarilal Nanda and Chandra Shekhar never got the opportunity. Indira Gandhi hoisted it 11 times consecutively during her first term and 5 more times in her second. Atal Bihari Vajpayee did so 6 times, Rajiv Gandhi and P.V. Narasimha Rao each did it 5 times, while Lal Bahadur Shastri and Morarji Desai did it twice. Others, like Charan Singh, V.P. Singh, H.D. Deve Gowda, and I.K. Gujral, managed it only once.

This tradition reflects the continuity and symbolism of India’s democratic leadership on its most important national day.",Politics
The Telegraph,2025-07-18 00:00:00,Meet Haridwar Blinkit boy Priyanka Chopra follows on Instagram — his GRWM content is lit,"Priyanka, who follows about 585 people on Instagram, is one of the sixty-thousand-odd followers Benjamin Ryan Gautam has on the platform. A Blinkit delivery boy from Haridwar has found a fan in Indian-origin LA-based actress Priyanka Chopra Jonas.

Priyanka, who follows about 585 people on Instagram, is one of the sixty-thousand-odd followers Benjamin Ryan Gautam has on the platform. Benjamin’s hilarious take on the ‘Get Ready With Me’ trend in his Instagram reels has become an internet sensation. He quickly caught the attention of netizens after recording his pre-work routine with his effortless charisma, fake American accent and confident approach.

Taking a jibe at his daily work routine, Benjamin humorously refers to his GRWM sessions as “dihadi time” — a colloquial Hindi phrase for daily wages earned by labourers.

His contagious energy, sassy attitude and dramatic gestures before he steps out of his house for his daily work thoroughly amuses his audience.

With a steel glass in his hand, Benjamin kicks off one of his videos, rolling his eyes before dramatically saying, “It’s dihadi time.”

Benjamin snaps his fingers and applies moisturiser on his face and hands to keep his skin “hydrated” — a regular habit that he has inculcated over the years.

Next, he puts on his yellow Blinkit uniform, but instead of the seamless transformation seen in videos by other influencers, Benjamin takes a pause, gives a deadpan expression, before manually changing his clothes. Flaunting his sharp jawline in a humorous manner and applying moisturiser on his hands, he checks off his routine. But not before a swipe of lip balm, because who doesn’t want glossy lips?

“Spreading Joy and Good Vibes,” reads Benjamin’s Instagram bio where he introduces himself as a dancer chasing dreams. The delivery agent doesn’t miss a chance to make the most out of his day. “New chapter, new me,” he writes in his bio.

From train stations to college and parks, there’s not a single place — private and public — that Benjamin hasn’t got ready for work at.

As trains come and go, Benjamin keeps his phone on a washbasin stand and preps himself for the day. Skincare routine is a must for him, and he doesn’t let it slide even when he’s in a public place. “Skincare king,” wrote an Instagram user in the comments section, hyping him up. “This diva never misses,” another fan shared. Even though he makes his delivery boy routine his entire persona on social media, it is actually not his full-time job. As it turns out, Benjamin is a college student who moonlights as a Blinkit guy. Right after his college ends after long lectures and “zero motivation”, he sheds his student uniform to don the yellow jacket for another day of hustle.

An eagle-eyed fan spotted Priyanka following Benjamin on Instagram. “Even Priyanka Chopra Follows Him For The Accent,” they wrote. “Guy's Priyanka Chopra is following this guy. Howw...??” another Instagram user asked. Not just delivery outings, Benjamin also delights viewers with his GRWM sessions for family gatherings, religious events and night outs with his best friend.

A true diva, as called by his followers on social media, Benjamin gave a spin to his morning routines with a video on this year’s Pride Parade. “Let’s go bold this time,” he says, before letting everyone know that he celebrates Pride Month for his friend who is gay. On the work front, Priyanka is currently basking in the success of her Prime Video film Heads of State, co-starring John Cena and Idris Elba. Priyanka plays the role of MI6 agent Noel Bisset, who embarks on a mission to protect the US President (Cena) and the UK Prime Minister (Elba) while uncovering a global conspiracy in the action-thriller. The film hit the streamer on July 2. ","Blinkit delivery boy and college student Benjamin Ryan Gautam from Haridwar has gone viral for his humorous “Get Ready With Me” reels, catching the eye of Priyanka Chopra Jonas—who now follows him on Instagram. Known for his wit, accent, and skincare routines, Benjamin balances studies, deliveries, and internet stardom effortlessly.",Entertainment

 Frontline,2025-05-24 00:00:00,Long live revolution!,"For the past few nights, my bedfellow has been the British-Mexican Surrealist painter and author, Leonora Carrington (1917-2011). Her book, The Hearing Trumpet (1974), featuring a plucky, deaf, bearded, 92-year-old woman called Marian Leatherby, who nurtures a lifelong dream of “going to Lapland to be drawn in a vehicle by dogs, woolly dogs,” is so wacky that it upends all expectations of fiction. I am identifying so much with Marian that I feel quite exposed. For one, my lifelong desire is Marian’s in toto, with the added wish to make angels in the snow under the aurora borealis.

At the beginning of the novel, Marian is staying with her son’s family, who have conveniently pushed her to a room in the back yard. There she lives with a morose maid, two cats, a maguey plant, and two hens, who sleep with her on the bed. Her best friend is Carmella, who is bald with age but sports a wig of flame red hair. Marian’s favourite pastime is to brush the cats “to keep their long fur smart and glossy and to reserve the hair I get off the combs for Carmella, who has promised to knit it into a jumper when there is enough”.  

","Leonora Carrington’s The Hearing Trumpet is a surreal, humorous novel centered on 92-year-old Marian Leatherby, whose whimsical dreams and eccentric life challenge norms of age and fiction. The narrator deeply connects with Marian’s oddities and desires, especially her longing to visit Lapland and make snow angels under the northern lights.",Lifestyle and Features

Frantic relatives today mobbed officials seeking information about victims of yesterday’s stampede which has claimed 36 lives even as the railways had a tough time dealing with the rush of three crore Kumbh devotees thronging the city.

There were chaotic scenes at the Allahabad railway station and local hospitals treating the 39 injured with relatives struggling to get information about their near and dear ones. An inquiry committee set up to investigate the reasons behind the stampede has been directed to submit its report within a month, UP Chief Secretary Javed Usmani said. Among the 36 victims, 29 were women and a girl child. Of the 39 injured, 27 are women.

Angry relatives confronted officials and politicians who had come to enquire about the health of those admitted to various hospitals. Commissioner of Allahabad Division Devesh Chaturvedi had to be whisked away to safety after he faced the wrath of victims’ kin.

Confusion and mismanagement at the railway station for hours after the stampede has clearly revealed the lack of coordination and any workable disaster management plan. It resulted in many more deaths later in the night as the injured did not receive medical attention in time.

“My daughter may have survived, had she been treated in time. She was alive and in pain for hours. But we could not reach hospital due to chaos,” said Bedi Lal, father of eight-year-old Muskan, the youngest among the victims.

Today, a semblance of order was visible at the railway station with a host of employees directing pilgrims to their respective entry and exit points at the station.

Of the 39 injured, 33 have been admitted to the Swaroop Rani Nehru hospital, five are undergoing in Tej Bahadur Sapru Hospital. One injured has been admitted to Motilal Nehru Hospital.

Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav today raised the compensation for the grievously injured from Rs one lakh to two lakh. The next of kin of the dead will receive Rs 5 lakh from the UP Government.

Separately, Railway Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal has announced ex gratia payment of Rs 1 lakh for the dead, Rs 50, 000 for the seriously injured and Rs 25,000 for those with minor injuries. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has also announced compensation for the dead, revealed Bansal.

About the arrangements, he said 220 trains were arranged for the Mauni Amavasya besides 212 regular trains which pass through Allahabad and adjoining stations.","On February 10, 2013, a stampede at Allahabad railway station during the Kumbh Mela claimed 36 lives, including 29 women and a child, and injured 39 others.

Relatives of victims confronted officials, and some injured reportedly died due to delayed medical attention. An inquiry committee was formed to investigate the incident. Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav announced increased compensation for victims, while Railway Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh also declared ex gratia payments.

Astronomer CEO Andy Bryon’s alleged affair with his firm’s HR head Kristin Cabot, purportedly exposed by a kiss cam at a recent Coldplay concert in Massachusetts, has become meme fodder, with posts — right from jokes on Boomers to jibes at corporate culture — flooding social media overnight.  

It all started with a viral video from Coldplay’s Wednesday concert.  In the short clip, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin draws attention to a couple embracing each other during the show. The man and the woman were later identified as Byron and Cabot. As the kiss cam zoomed in on the two, Byron ducked out of view, while Cabot buried her face in her hands.  

Martin couldn’t help but quip, ""Oh look at these two. Either they are having an affair or they are just very shy.”  

The video soon snowballed into a meme fest. “Boomers hate remote work because it precludes them from having affairs with their colleagues,” an X user wrote.   Another quipped about the divorce laws and alimony, highlighting how adultery may prove costly. “Imagine having so little respect for yourself and another woman' s marriage that you are okay giving yourself to a man that ducks when he's seen with you,” remarked an X user.  Another social media user shared a photo that shows him hugging his wife from behind. Referring to the viral clip doing the rounds on the internet, he wrote, ""Telling my kids this was taken at a Coldplay concert"". There were also jokes on Coldplay.

Megan has drawn the support of netizens in overwhelming numbers following the scandal. 

“The Astronomer CEO’s wife after she saw the video from the concert,” reads the caption to a meme on X.   “Taking your cheating partner to a public concert with cameras is just wild. I pity his wife,” reads another post on X.  Sharing a still from the mockumentary sitcom The Office, a Reddit user took a dig at Byron and Cabot.  “I was there and saw it live, felt so much second hand embarrassment,” commented another Reddit user on the post.  “I got caught cheating on my wife with the Head of HR at a concert. Here are 5 things it taught me about executive leadership,” wrote an Instagram user, pretending to be Byron. Several fake accounts were opened in Byron’s name on Instagram. The bio of one of them reads, “CEO. Father. Devoted husband/boyfriend. Avid Coldplay fan.”  Byron has been the CEO of Astronomer since July 2023. The tech firm is headquartered in New York.

The Tribune,2013-02-13 00:00:00,CBI to probe VVIP copter deal Defence Ministry orders inquiry after CEO of Italian helicopter maker held on graft charges,"New Delhi, February 12
The arrest of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of aerospace giant Finmeccanica in Italy on graft charges today prompted the Defence Minister AK Antony to order a CBI probe into Rs 3,500-crore helicopter deal with the manufacturer.

India had placed an order of 12 copters for VVIP use with AugustaWestland, a subsidiary of Finmeccanica. The multicore deal was signed in February 2010. The first lot, comprising three copters, was delivered in December last year while the remaining nine would be delivered in batches by March 2014.

“Future deliveries will depend on the outcome of the CBI probe and the Ministry of Defence could evoke the integrity clause to stall the deal while imposing penalties on the maker,” top MoD sources said. The next batch of three choppers is arriving in June this year, followed by another batch in December and the last one in March 2014.
Defence Ministry spokesperson Sitanshu Kar said: “The contract signed with Augusta Westland includes specific provisions against bribery and the use of undue influence as well as an integrity pact. Since no specific input has been received so far from the two governments (UK and Italy), the MoD has decided to refer the case to the CBI for inquiry”. Under the integrity pact, the MoD could forfeit the bank guarantees furnished by the copter-maker.

The copters supplied by Augusta would be a part of the IAF’s Communication Squadron, which ferries the President, the Prime Minister and other VVIPs. So far, the Russian-built Mi-17 is used for VVIP duties.

“Giuseppe Orsi, the head of Italian defence and aerospace giant Finmeccanica, was arrested on Monday in relation to a probe into international corruption. He is suspected of involvement in the payment of bribes regarding the sale of 12 helicopters by Finmeccanica's subsidiary AugustaWestland to the Indian government,"" Italian news agency Ansa said. Orsi, the CEO of Finmeccanica, was at the helm of AugustaWestland when the deal was struck and he is suspected of involvement in the payment of bribes. Prosecutors suspect that around 50 million euros (Rs 362 crore approximately), about 10 per cent of the deal were ploughed back into kickbacks to ensure AugustaWestland won the contract, the agency reported. The Italian firm had won the bid beating American chopper maker Sikorsky. The BJP today said it has been raising the issue of financial irregularities in the VVIP helicopter deal for the past one year and insisted that the Congress-led UPA government must give an explanation about the reported anomalies. After the arrest, the Italian firm said in a statement: ""Finmeccanica expresses support for its chairman and CEO, with the hope that clarity is established quickly, whilst reaffirming its confidence in the judges.""

The deal has been under the scanner for more than a year now after Italian media reports suggested the arrest of two alleged middlemen in Europe for paying bribes to secure it. In December 2012, Defence Minister AK Antony told Parliament that there were allegations of bribery in a deal to procure VVIP helicopters from Augusta Westland, but no formal inquiry has been ordered into the case due to lack of “specific information” so far. “If any wrongdoing is found in the case, suitable measures will be taken by the ministry,” he had said.","Following the arrest of Finmeccanica CEO Giuseppe Orsi in Italy on bribery charges, India’s Defence Minister AK Antony ordered a CBI probe into the ₹3,500 crore VVIP helicopter deal with AgustaWestland, a Finmeccanica subsidiary.

The Telegraph,2025-07-18 00:00:00,"Niti Aayog: Ease investment rules for Chinese firms, let them buy up to 24% in Indian companies","An easing in military tensions since October has led to more efforts by both countries to mend ties, with India seeking a 'permanent solution' to their decades-old border dispute. The Indian government's top think tank has proposed easing rules that de facto require extra scrutiny for investments by Chinese companies, arguing that the rules have meant delays for some sizeable deals, three government sources said.

Currently, all investment by Chinese entities in Indian companies need to gain a security clearance from both India's home and foreign ministries.

The think tank, NITI Aayog, has proposed that Chinese companies can take a stake of up to 24% in an Indian company without any approval being required, said the sources who were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.

The proposal, reported for the first time by Reuters, is part of a plan to boost foreign direct investment in India and is being studied by the trade ministry's industries department, the finance and foreign ministries, as well as Prime Minister Narendra Modi's office, the sources said.

And while not all of NITI Aayog's ideas are necessarily taken up by the government, the proposal comes at a time when India and China are seeking to mend ties that have been particularly strained since border clashes in 2020. Any decision to ease might be months away and will be taken by political leaders, two of the sources said. They added that the industries department is in favour of easing, but the other government bodies are yet to give their final view.

NITI Aayog, the ministries, the industries department and the prime minister's office did not reply to Reuters requests for comment.

DEALS SHELVED

The rules were put in place in 2020 after border clashes, including hand-to-hand fighting between the two neighbours.

They only apply to land bordering nations, which affects Chinese companies the most. By contrast, companies from other countries can freely invest in many sectors such as manufacturing and pharmaceuticals, while some sensitive sectors such as defence, banking and media have restrictions.

Deals such as a 2023 plan by China's BYD to invest $1 billion in an electric car joint venture have been shelved due to the rules, sources have said.

While foreign investment has slowed globally since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the rules hampering Chinese investment in India have been seen as a significant factor behind a large drop in the South Asian country's FDI. Net foreign direct investment in India tumbled to a record low of just $353 million in the past financial year, a fraction of the $43.9 billion logged in the year ended March 2021.

An easing in military tensions since October has led to more efforts by both countries to mend ties, with plans for the resumption of direct flights and India seeking a ""permanent solution"" to their decades-old border dispute.

Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar's made his first trip to China in five years this week, telling his counterpart that the two nations must settle tensions along their border and avoid restrictive trade measures such as China's curbs on the supply of rare earth magnets.

The think tank has also recommended revamping the board that decides on foreign direct investment proposals, the sources said.","NITI Aayog has proposed allowing Chinese firms to invest up to 24% in Indian companies without prior approval, aiming to boost FDI amid easing India-China tensions. The proposal, under review by key ministries and the PMO, follows years of strained ties and stalled investments due to post-2020 security restrictions.",International News
The Tribune,2013-02-14 00:00:00,"VVIP copter deal put on hold Italian prosecutors name IAF ex-Chief Tyagi, his cousins in kickback case","New Delhi, February 13
Defence Minister AK Antony today said the government would blacklist and take legal action against any recipient of bribe in the Rs 3,600-crore VVIP helicopter deal. In Italy, prosecutors submitted a warrant in a court alleging that former IAF Chief SP Tyagi and his three cousins were in cahoots to tweak the deal to suit Italian aerospace major Finmeccanica.

The former IAF Chief, however, today categorically rebutted allegations of having changed any air staff qualitative requirements (ASQRs) during his tenure (2004 to 2007) to suit the Italian firm. The legal papers in the Italian court (translated copy with The Tribune) run contrary to this claim and show that Tyagi met agents of the Italian company at the offices of his three cousins and also during social events like weddings.

Even as Antony let his mind be known, the Ministry of Defence has decided to put on hold the receipt of the remaining nine of the 12 helicopters. Three helicopters were received in December 2012. India will invoke the penalty clause mandated under the integrity pact. “We will not lose a single pie. We can get back the entire amount paid to the vendor (Finmeccanica),” Antony said in the morning.

“We are not bothered about who the companies are, how strong they are. Everything depends on the CBI inquiry. The moment we get a report from the CBI, whoever is found guilty, Indian or foreigner, we will take the strongest action against them. They have to pay the price for the lapses. Nobody will be spared,” he said.

When asked about the integrity pact, he said, “Our integrity pact is foolproof. Any vendor signing an integrity pact cannot get away. They are legally bound.”

Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Finmeccanica Giuseppe Orsi was arrested in Italy on Monday for allegedly handing out bribe to secure contract for his company. Italian prosecutors said Orsi hired US-born Guido Ralph Haschke to lead dealings in India to secure the contract.

Haschke and his partner Carlo Gerosa, prosecutors said, had close ties with the Tyagi brothers. Around 400,000 euros (Rs 3.2 crore) were given as consultancy fee to Haschke and Gerosa. “Of this, 100,000 euros (Rs 72 lakh) in cash were given to the Tyagi brothers,” prosecutors said in the 62-page warrant. “The money went to the brothers to pressure Indian officials and help doctor the tender terms to favour the specification of AgustaWestland’s helicopters,” they added.

The report of the persecutors submitted in the office of the judge for preliminary investigations narrates how the Russian Mi-17, Eurocopter and US Sikorsky were edged out of the VVIP helicopter deal. Around Rs 350 crore (51 million euros) were allegedly “spent” on the deal.

What Italian court papers say

● Michel Christian, a consultant to AgustaWestland, corresponded with cousins of former IAF Chief SP Tyagi

● The agreement was with the Tyagi family, but the money was handed over only to his cousin Juli Tyagi

● Witness identified as ADR says: “Towards the end of 2006, I again met Tyagi (Air) Marshal at the office of his cousins in Delhi

● After Tyagi retired (March 2007), we met at the home/office of Tyagi brothers and during a wedding in India, ADR adds

● Tender was changed to accommodate AgustaWestland by lowering the required altitude limit at which the helicopters could operate

● Terms and conditions of the tender were changed to introduce an engine failure flying test

● This favoured AgustaWestland as its helicopters were the only ones with three engines

The moment we get a report from the CBI, whoever is found guilty, Indian or foreigner, we will take the strongest action against them. They have to pay the price for the lapses. Nobody will be spared.

The Tribune,2013-02-15 00:00:00,Govt blames NDA for VVIP copter mess  Says changes made after Brajesh Mishra’s observations  Asks manufacturer for details of ‘bribes’,"New Delhi, February 14
Apportioning blame on the Atal Behari Vajpayee-led PMO, the Ministry of Defence today said specifications in the VVIP helicopter deal were mooted in 2003, while it separately asked AgustaWestland to categorically state its financial transactions with agents in India.

The letter to AgustaWestland is the first indication that the deal is to be cancelled with imposition of financial penalties on the helicopter maker and recovery of all money with interest, sources said.

India had ordered 12 helicopters for VVIP use from AgustaWestland, a subsidiary of Finmeccanica. The Rs 3,500-crore deal was signed in February 2010 and the first lot of three helicopters was delivered last December. The delivery of the remaining nine, which were scheduled to be delivered in batches by March 2014, was put on hold yesterday. Allegations of bribery surfaced after Italy arrested the Finmeccanica CEO Giuseppe Orsi and the MoD ordered a CBI probe on February 12.

Today, the defence ministry issued a seven-page “factsheet”. It narrated how the operative requirements (specifications) were changed following the observations of Principal Secretary to PM (Brajesh Mishra) in November 2003. It also exposed former IAF Chief SP Tyagi’s claim that “no specifications were changed in my time as Chief ”.

The MoD note said the new specifications were deliberated between the IAF, Special Protection Group, PMO and MoD between March 2005 and September 2006 and the changes were incorporated. SP Tyagi was IAF Chief between December 31, 2004 and March 31, 2007.

The factsheet says: “The Principal Secretary to the PM observed on November 19, 2003 that his main concern was the framing of the mandatory requirements had led into a single vendor situation. The PM and President rarely visit places involving flying at an altitude beyond 4,500 metre. It was decided to make the mandatory requirement for operational altitude 4,500 metre. The higher flying ceiling of 6,000 metre and cabin height of 1.8 metre could be made desirable operational requirements. It was observed that with these revisions, several helicopters which otherwise met all requirements but had been rejected due to the altitude restriction, would now come into the reckoning.” One of them was AW 101 of AgustaWestland, which was later selected.

In the first global tender issued in March 2002, only the Eurocopter EC 225 was found suitable for acquisition. The AgustaWestland helicopter was not certified to fly at 6,000 metre while the Russian M-17-2 did not meet mandatory requirements. This made it a single vendor situation -- not permitted under defence procurement rules.

“On December 22 , 2003, the Principal Secretary to the PM asked to draw up realistic mandatory requirements satisfying operational, security and convenience requirements and also set in motion a fast track process for selection and acquisition,” the note says.

In May 2004, the NDA lost the elections and the UPA was voted to power. Now President, Pranab Mukherjee was the Defence Minister between May 23, 2004 and October 24, 2006.

The note now explains: “The Acceptance of Necessity (AON) for the procurement of 12 helicopters was accorded by the Defence Acquisition Council under the ‘buy’ category on January 3, 2006. The request for proposal (RFP) was issued to six vendors on September 27, 2006.”

Besides AgustaWestland, Sikorsky of USA and. Russian MI-17-2 responded to the RFP. The Staff Evaluation Report found the AW-101 to be fully compliant as a VVIP copter. The Technical Oversight Committee constituted on August 6, 2008, found that the field evaluation trials and selection of vendors were done according to prescribed procedures.

Since February 2012, the MOD has been following up with the Italians on getting details. A formal request was made by the Indian Embassy to the Naples prosecutors’ office on July 16, 2012. On a complaint by Edmund Allen of Ganton Limited, USA, the MoD had written on April 19, 2012 to the CBI and Enforcement Directorate for necessary action. The ED said it was probing the allegations. The MoD sounded the income tax authorities.","The Ministry of Defence (MoD) issued a detailed factsheet clarifying that changes to the VVIP helicopter deal specifications were initiated in 2003 during the NDA government, under Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The changes were based on recommendations from Brajesh Mishra, then Principal Secretary to the PM, who raised concerns about the altitude and cabin height requirements creating a single-vendor situation. These revisions allowed AgustaWestland’s AW-101 helicopter to qualify. The MoD also asked AgustaWestland to disclose its financial transactions with Indian agents, signaling potential cancellation of the ₹3,500 crore deal and recovery of funds. Former IAF Chief SP Tyagi’s denial of involvement was contradicted by the timeline, as he served during the period when changes were finalized. The Defence Minister reiterated that penalties would be imposed if wrongdoing was confirmed.",Politics
The Tribune,2013-02-16 00:00:00,Govt to cancel VVIP helicopter deal  Puts AgustaWestland on notice  CBI to send team to Italy,"New Delhi, February 15
In a move that will be keenly watched by governments and defence equipment makers, New Delhi today took the first step to cancel the Rs 3,500 crore deal for 12 AgustaWestland AW-101 helicopters with Italian aerospace major Finmeccanica.

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) issued a formal show-cause notice to AgustaWestland UK, a subsidiary of Finmeccanica, for cancellation of the contract and taking other action as per the terms of the contract and integrity pact, ministry spokesperson Sitanshu Kar said. “With today’s notice, the operation of the contract has been put on hold. The company has been asked to reply to the notice in seven days,” the statement said.

The notice will over-ride existing action such as initiation of a CBI probe into allegations of bribery on February 12. The cancellation of the contract for the VVIP helicopters will mean India would recover the entire cost and damages from AgustaWestland and could also ban its operations in the country. A final call is yet to be taken on whether the entire Finmeccanica group, with its corporate headquarters in New Delhi’s Nehru Place, is banned or its subsidiary AgustaWestland alone faces the ban.

Under provisions of the contract and the integrity pact, India can cancel the contract and recover the money. AgustaWestland did not declare its agents and is under contract to have not paid any amount to any individual or firm for securing the deal.

The cancellation means the helicopter maker will not be entitled to compensation and will be liable to refund payments made by India in terms of the contract with interest. The MoD will also forfeit the bank guarantee running into millions of euros. So far, the MoD has reportedly paid about Rs 1,000 crore to AgustaWestland.

The CBI today registered a complaint on the basis of a letter and the clippings of Italian and Indian newspapers provided by the Defence Ministry asking the investigating agency to probe the alleged Rs 350 crore kickback paid by an Italian firm to clear the deal. A formal case will be registered once the authenticated documents with translations are made available through the Ministry of External Affairs.

A CBI team is also being sent to Italy where the CEOs of AgustaWestland and its parent company Finmeccanica have been arrested on charges that kickbacks to the tune of around Rs 350 crore were paid to bag the deal for the VVIP helicopters.

A complaint was registered when senior officials of the MoD and the CBI met today. The case has been registered to ascertain if any kickbacks were paid, sources said. A warrant in an Italian Court says bribes were paid to cousins of former IAF Chief SP Tyagi to tweak the specifications of the tender. He has denied the allegations.

Yesterday in Europe, the Finmeccania stock dropped and was being traded at Euro 4.19 against Euro 4.76 three days ago. Being banned in the Indian defence market -- that is looking to spend $100 billion in the next decade -- could hive off a major chunk of present and future business for Finmeccanica while its rivals are expected to gain by its elimination. As per the 2012 yearbook of Swedish think-tank Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), New Delhi is the biggest Arms importer.

This is not the first blacklisting of companies and cancellation of contracts. In March 2012, India had blacklisted four foreign companies and two Indian companies on bribery allegation and got the CBI to register a case. Israel Military Industries Ltd; Singapore Technologies Kinetics Ltd; Rheinmetall Air Defence, Zurich; Corporation Defence, Russia; TS Kisan and Co, New Delhi, and RK Machine Tools, Ludhiana, were banned for 10 years. ","On February 15, 2013, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) formally issued a show-cause notice to AgustaWestland UK, initiating the process to cancel the ₹3,500 crore VVIP helicopter deal. The notice, based on bribery allegations involving Finmeccanica’s CEO and middlemen, puts the contract on hold and demands a response within seven days. India may recover all payments with interest, forfeit bank guarantees, and potentially blacklist the company. The CBI registered a complaint and is sending a team to Italy to investigate alleged ₹350 crore kickbacks. Former IAF Chief SP Tyagi and his cousins are accused of manipulating tender specifications.

As teams from the Defence Ministry and the Central Bureau of Investigation are getting ready to fly to Italy to obtain details of the alleged illegal pay-offs in the Rs 3,500-crore VVIP copter deal, an Italian court is learnt to have rejected India’s plea for documents related to the investigations into the case.

The Italian probe report has a mention of a military man who too received kickbacks. The middleman of Italian aerospace major Finmeccanica, Guido Haschke, mentions negotiations with an important person in the Indian defence set-up apart from former IAF Chief SP Tyagi and his three cousins.

The Indian embassy in Rome received communication today from the Judge of Preliminary Invetigations of the Tribunal Busto Arsizio Luca Labianca stating that it was ""not possible to give a positive reply"" to the Indian request, the sources said.

The judge is hearing the matter on alleged bribes which AgustaWestland, a subsidiary of Finmeccanica, routed through a team of European middlemen to Indian officials. In the letter received by the Indian embassy, the judge said: “The investigations were, in fact, at a preliminary stage, during which, as per Article 329 of Code of Penal Procedure, all information is covered by secrecy. Only parties and their lawyers were allowed to have access to the information and documents.”

However, there’s a glimmer of hope. In the letter, the Italian judge has told the Indian embassy that his office will consider a ""fresh request"" from the Indian side once the secrecy obligations into the matter get over. Indian embassy in Rome had requested for documents of the probe after the arrest of Finmeccanica chief Giuseppe Orsi in connection with allegations that kickbacks to the tune of Rs 350 crore were paid in VVIP copter deal. Lorenzo Borgogni, former head of external relations of Finmeccanica, was arrested in 2012 following a phone-tap in Italy by agencies that were looking for links between the mafia, big companies and government officials. He has now turned an approver and spilled the beans on his bosses. The MoD today said it was sending Joint Secretary and Acquisition Manager (Air) Arun Kumar Bal to Italy on Monday to try to get as much information as possible related to the facts of the deal. The CBI team will comprise an investigation officer and a law officer.

The MoD had yesterday initiated the first step to cancel the deal by issuing a show-cause notice to AgustaWestland, asking why the contract should not be cancelled in view of the corruption allegations against it. It sought a reply within seven days. In a statement, AgustaWestland has contradicted reports which pre-maturely talked about cancellation of the contract.

“The MoD has not cancelled the contract but has given notice. AgustaWestland is preparing its answers,” it said.

Appearing before a magistrate in Italy, Orsi has denied that he gave any mandate to Guido Hashcke for ""any type of manoeuvre"" for the operation of India, or about knowing the Tyagi family,” Orsi's lawyer Ennio Amodio was quoted as saying by Italian news agency ANSA. Haschke, in his testimony, has said he was acting on behalf of Orsi.

The family mystery

The warrant in Italian Court talks about how “the family” was to get nearly Rs 194 crore. There were two agreements between AgustaWestland and the middlemen. One was for 42 million euros (Rs 294 crore), which the copter-maker was to pay to Global Services of Christian Michel.
While the BJP on Friday night alleged that “the family” was a reference to Gandhis, the Congress denied it.
On Saturday, the lawyer of arrested CEO Finmeccanica Giuseppe Orsi told Indian mediapersons in Italy that the reference to ""the family"" in Italian documents pertains to Tyagis.","India’s efforts to obtain documents from Italy regarding the ₹3,500 crore VVIP helicopter deal hit a roadblock as an Italian court rejected the request, citing secrecy provisions under its penal code.

Bolsonaro, who is about to stand trial over an alleged coup attempt, will also face restrictions on social media use, local media said. The Brazilian top court on Friday ordered former president Jair Bolsonaro to wear an electronic ankle monitor, a Reuters report said. The court has also ordered the former president to cease all communications with his son Eduardo and Ambassadors, as well as stop using social media.

According to a Bloomberg report, which cited local press, police carried out search warrants against Bolsonaro on Friday. He is about to stand trial over an alleged coup attempt.

The federal police said in a statement that they carried out two search and seizure warrants, “in addition to precautionary measures other than imprisonment.” The statement didn’t mention Bolsonaro by name but referred to the case he is involved in before the Supreme Court. The police operation was authorised by Brazil’s Supreme Court, which has drawn criticism from US President Donald Trump, who claims there is a “witch hunt” against Bolsonaro and his supporters, the report said.Bolsonaro-Trump bonhomie
Earlier on Thursday, Trump ratcheted up pressure on Brazil to drop criminal charges against former president Bolsonaro, saying he would be “watching closely” for a response just a week after threatening to impose punishing tariffs on the South American nation, Bloomberg reported.

In an open letter addressed to Bolsonaro, Trump described the right-wing populist leader as the victim of “terrible treatment” and again demanding that the trial over his alleged role in a failed coup attempt to overturn the 2022 election “should end immediately!”

Trump said he was “very concerned about the attacks on free speech — both in Brazil and in the United States — coming out of the current government.”

Trump's tariff threat to Brazil
The warning marks the latest escalation in a high-stakes feud between the leaders of the Western hemisphere’s most populous nations, and comes amid a flurry of letters sent by the US president to announce tariffs on other economies. Trump threatened President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva with a 50 per cent levy on Brazil, citing the treatment of Bolsonaro and grievances over allegedly unfair trade practices.

On Tuesday, the Office of the US Trade Representative opened an investigation, at Trump’s direction, into Brazil’s trade practices and whether the country is unfairly restricting US exports, the report added.

Yet Brazil’s case has been unique. Latin America’s largest economy runs a trade deficit with the US, while almost all of Trump’s other tariff targets post large surpluses, and its 79-year-old president has so far shown no signs of heeding to US demands.","On Friday, Brazilian police, under Supreme Court orders, searched former President Jair Bolsonaro’s home and party headquarters as part of an investigation into an alleged coup attempt.

The VVIP helicopter scandal could not have surfaced at a worse time for the beleaguered United Progressive Alliance Government that is bracing to face the Opposition during the budget session that opens this week.

The budget session is always critical for any government as its Parliamentary managers have to exhibit dexterity in handling issues till the Finance Bill gets approved by the Lok Sabha. The current session is due from February 21 to May 10, with a four-week recess between March and April.

Both the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Left parties have already dug trenches to take on the government and the latest allegations of Rs 350-crore kickbacks in the VVIP helicopter deal with Italy will give the Opposition an added ammo to pillory the UPA-2 that has been mired in a series of corruption charges.

The BJP has already termed this deal as a second Bofors in the making. It also plans to corner the government by attacking Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde for his saffron terror remarks.

These are the two hot button political issues for the UPA leaders besides the regular ones like price rise, railway fare hike, increase in the prices of petrol and gradual dismantling of subsidy on diesel, labour unrest, security situation and outrage over the mutilation of Indian solider bodies on the Line of Control in J&K.

Another festering problem for the UPA is the demand by the Left parties to remove the Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman PJ Kurien for his alleged involvement in the Suryanelli sex scandal that has come back to haunt the Congress leader from Kerala after 17 years.

The CPM today fired a fresh salvo against Kurien appealing to the Congress leadership to view the matter in a proper perspective and not see it as being raised by it for party-political purpose.

It said surfacing of fresh evidence in the case comes in the background of the Supreme Court orders and stated that Kurien had got benefit of a 2005 ‘flawed’ judgment of the High Court when his petition was not included as one of the accused by the High Court and the Supreme Court.

“A reinvestigation is essential and Kurien should step down from his post of Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, till it is over. The Kerala Government is adopting double standards by not ordering a reinvestigation into the case against Kurien.” The CPM Polit Bureau said in a statement.","India’s efforts to obtain official documents from Italy regarding the ₹3,500 crore VVIP helicopter deal were denied by an Italian court, citing legal secrecy during preliminary investigations. The case involves alleged kickbacks paid by AgustaWestland, a subsidiary of Finmeccanica, to Indian officials including former IAF Chief SP Tyagi and his cousins. Middleman Guido Haschke claimed negotiations with key defence personnel. The Ministry of Defence and CBI are sending teams to Italy to gather more information. Meanwhile, AgustaWestland has been issued a show-cause notice by the MoD, initiating steps toward cancellation of the contract. Political tensions escalated as the BJP alleged that “the family” mentioned in Italian documents referred to the Gandhis, though Finmeccanica’s CEO’s lawyer clarified it referred to the Tyagis. The scandal is expected to dominate the upcoming budget session in Parliament.",International News

The Tribune,2013-02-19 00:00:00,Govt ready to discuss copter deal: PM,"New Delhi, February 18
Having come under attack from the Opposition on allegations of kickback in the VVIP helicopter deal, the Manmohan Singh Government today gave ample indication that it is ready to discuss the issue suggesting that Parliament was the appropriate forum for it.

“Parliament is the appropriate forum to discuss all issues raised by the Opposition. We are ready for any discussion”, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said here on the sidelines of a function here in response to questions on threat by the opposition to raise it in Parliament.

With the Budget session of Parliament scheduled to begin on Thursday, progress of the corruption case in Italy and allegations of some people in India having received Rs 360 crore to facilitate the deal for procurement of 12 VVIP helicopters is bound to cast a long shadow.

The BJP and the CPM have attacked the Government for the delay in launching a probe into the issue that first surfaced almost a year ago. While the BJP wanted the Government to keep the procurement on the hold, the CPM demanded cancellation of the Rs 3,500 crore contract .

However, sources in the ministry maintained there was neither an internal probe nor any delay but no response at all from authorities in Italy.

Aware that the allegations of kickback blew up in its face despite the Ministry having taken strong and deterrent action like cancellation of purchase and blacklisting of companies on receiving complaints of corruption in procurement, effort is to iterate the case when Parliament convenes.

“We have nothing to hide”, a senior minister said adding that the fact sheet has already been put in the public domain by the Ministry of Defence.

The Ministry had released the document a day after a court in Italy ordered the arrest of Giuseppe Orsi, the then Chief Executive Officer of Finmecannia, the parent company of Agusta Westland, which manufactures helicopters.

As for the decision to launch a CBI probe and serving a show cause notice to Finmecannia to respond whether or not kickbacks were paid, sources in the Ministry said it was an administrative issue that does not require any permission from other than the Minister concerned.

BJP spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudy launched a direct attack on the Defence Minister, saying “This is a monumental scam in which kickbacks of Rs 360 crore were paid. Antony is now giving several orders and statements and is struggling to keep his Mr Clean image. But the fact remains that he has been Defence Minister since October 24, 2006.”","Prime Minister Manmohan Singh stated that the government is prepared to discuss the VVIP helicopter deal controversy in Parliament, asserting transparency and denying any cover-up. The ₹3,500 crore AgustaWestland contract, now under CBI investigation, has drawn sharp criticism from the BJP and CPM over alleged ₹360 crore kickbacks. The Opposition accused the government of delaying the probe and demanded cancellation of the deal. The Defence Ministry defended its actions, citing lack of cooperation from Italian authorities and emphasizing that administrative steps like issuing a show-cause notice and initiating a CBI inquiry do not require external approval. The scandal is expected to dominate the upcoming budget session, with broader political implications for the UPA government amid ongoing corruption allegations.",Politics

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today extracted an assurance from his British counterpart David Cameron that London would respond to any request for information with regard to the graft-tainted Anglo-Italian helicopter deal as the issue figured prominently during talks between the two leaders.

“I conveyed to Prime Minister Cameron our very serious concerns regarding allegations about unethical means used in securing the 2010 contract for AgustaWestland helicopters,” Manmohan Singh told the media after talks with the British leader.

He said India had also sought an explanation from the company to examine if the contractual provisions on unethical practices and the integrity pact had been violated. “I have sought full assistance from the UK in this case. Prime Minister Cameron has assured me of cooperation of his government in the investigations,” the PM said

On his part, Cameron promised that Britain would respond to any information sought by New Delhi, emphasising that the deal was being looked into in detail by the Italian authorities at this stage. “We will root out any problems of bribery and corruption whenever and wherever they appear. We have strong anti-bribery laws,” he added.

AgustaWestland, which manufactures helicopters in Britain, is owned by Italian aerospace giant Finmeccanica, whose chief was arrested last week over allegations that the company paid bribes to win the deal with India. Italian prosecutors have suggested that one of the alleged middlemen who used to secure the deal for Agusta Westland is based in London.

Cameron is on his second visit to India after becoming the Prime Minister at the head of a high-powered delegation, which includes representatives of more than 100 companies. Enhanced cooperation in the development of the defence industrial base of India through greater emphasis on technology transfer, co-development and co-production also figured during talks between the two PMs. The British leader committed his country to making available to India the cutting edge civil and military technology in accordance with its international obligations.

Talking about cooperation between the two countries in the fields of education and science and technology, the Indian leader impressed upon Cameron the need for a visa regime that facilitated greater movement of people. To this, Cameron told him that there were no limits on Indian students wanting to study in the UK.

He sought Britain’s support in ensuring an early conclusion of a fair, balance and forward looking broad-based India-EU Free Trade Agreement (FTA).

Taiwan’s Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim on Friday said Taipei does not want a conflict with China and will not provoke confrontation, but warned that Beijing's ""aggressive"" military posturing is counterproductive.

Chinese pressure on Taiwan had escalated over the past few years, but the island's people were peace-loving, Hsiao said while talking to the media at the Taiwan Foreign Correspondents' Club in Taipei. ""We do not seek conflict; we will not provoke confrontation,"" she said, reiterating President Lai Ching-te’s offer of talks between Taipei and Beijing.

The dispute between the two nations involves China's claim over democratic Taiwan as part of its own territory.

Beijing also called President Lai Ching-te a ""separatist"".

The Taiwanese president has repeatedly offered talks with China, but has been rebuffed. Since 2022, Beijing has staged at least six rounds of major war games around Taiwan. Hsiao further said for decades Taiwan's people and business have contributed to China's growth and prosperity, which has been possible only in a peaceful and stable environment.

""Aggressive military posturing is counterproductive and deprives the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait of opportunities to pursue an agenda of growth and prosperity,"" the vice president said. ""Defending the status quo (with China) is our choice, not because it is easy, but because it is responsible and consistent with the interests of our entire region.""

In 2023, China imposed sanctions on Hsiao for the second time, but they have little practical effect as senior Taiwanese officials do not travel to China and Chinese law has no jurisdiction over the entirely separately governed island. Meanwhile, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian in Beijing said whatever Taiwan's governing Democratic Progressive Party said or did, both sides of the strait belonged to ""one China"".

On the Taiwan-United States tariff talks, Hsiao said: ""With the United States, our negotiators are literally working around the clock to strive to reach an agreement on reciprocal tariffs to achieve trade balance while also promoting further bilateral cooperation in technology, investments and other areas.""

The Manmohan Singh government today avoided a possible showdown in Parliament with Union Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde expressing regret over his saffron terror remarks for which the Bharatiya Janata Party wanted an apology.

The remark by Shinde at the Congress session in Jaipur had resulted in the BJP delivering a threat which could have cast a shadow on the Budget session which begins tomorrow.

Congress parliamentary managers and BJP leaders agreed to work together on the Shinde issue who, late in the evening today, stated that he had no intention to link terror to any religion, almost echoing the party stand that terror has no colour.

Aware that turbulence is waiting to hit both the Houses over the VVIP helicopter scam, the government decided to blunt the Opposition attack somewhat as Shinde is also the Leader of the Lok Sabha. It has decided to face the Left parties’ onslaught asking for the resignation of Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman PJ Kurien for his alleged involvement in the 1996 Suryanelli sex scandal.

Kurien today sought to reach out to MPs by making them aware of the case. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kamal Nath insisted that the government would not agree to any discussion on it since “the case is clear. It has been cleared by the Supreme Court. We will not agree to hold a discussion in any House of Parliament on a subject of state politics”.

At the pre-session meeting called by Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar, leaders insisted they want the House to function while maintaining the right to raise issues that are agitating the people.

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh reiterated at the meeting that Parliament is a forum for discussion, dialogue and all parties have an obligation to ensure that it runs smoothly. He expressed hope and confidence that the Budget session would be fruitful in which Parliament would have to transact important financial business. “It is our sincere hope that we will have a productive, constructive debate leading to agreed solutions to the many national problems that our country faces. I have said this before and I repeat it again. Parliament is a forum for discussion, for dialogue, and all parties have an obligation to ensure that Parliament runs smoothly,” Manmohan Singh said.

After a strategy session, Law Minister Ashwani Kumar told The Tribune that the government wants Parliament to function smoothly and transact important legislation on food security, whistle-blowers’ protection, Lokpal and amendment to criminal laws dealing with sexual assault against women.

The government has an additional day tomorrow to narrow down differences with other parties since Parliament will adjourn for the day after the President's address to the joint session.

A protest by Left MPs before the session - in the form of a sit-in to express solidarity with the ongoing nationwide strike by trade unions - is the only thing on the agenda right now.

The NDA, after a meeting of the coalition, indicated that it would not allow the government any breathing space in this session. Its convener Sharad Yadav said, “On February 22, we will raise the issue of corruption in the helicopter deal in both Houses at noon. Before every session of Parliament, a new scam surfaces.""

In response, Nath reiterated that the government was willing to have any type of inquiry on which there was political consensus as the helicopter issue was not only about corruption but was also a slur on the country’s image. “We must have complete, transparent and very incisive inquiry,"" he said. 

 

PM hopeful of Smooth session

But no date has yet been set for a new round of talks, and both sides remain far apart on the terms of any ceasefire. In a major breakthrough in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, the Kremlin on Friday agreed with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv should be stepped up.

According to a Reuters report, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the Kremlin does not think US President Donald Trump's stance on Ukraine means the end of talks between Washington and Moscow. He was referring to recent warnings by the US regarding possible secondary sanctions on buyers of Russian exports.

Two rounds of talks between Ukraine and Russia in Turkey this year yielded an agreement to exchange prisoners and soldiers' remains. But no date has yet been set for a new round of talks, and both sides remain far apart on the terms of any ceasefire. Zelensky says talks with Russia need ‘more momentum’
President Zelensky said on Friday that peace negotiations with Russia needed “more momentum” and that he had asked new National Security and Defence Council secretary Rustem Umerov to “intensify the negotiation track”.

“The implementation of the agreements from the second Istanbul meeting is ongoing,” Zelensky wrote on X. ""This process needs more momentum.""

Russia, which is continuing a grinding offensive along much of the eastern front, has repeatedly said it is ready for a new round of talks but has not backed down from what Kyiv and its allies describe as its maximalist war aims.

US President Trump, who has sharpened his tone against Russia in recent weeks amid worsening air strikes on Ukrainian cities, threatened harsher sanctions on Russia earlier this week if a peace deal was not reached within 50 days. Zelensky added that he was also assigning Umerov, who until a major government reshuffle on Thursday had served as defence minister, to work on weapons agreements with Kyiv's allies.

Kyiv, which still relies on Western partners for more than half of its battlefield supply, is hoping a scaled-up domestic defence industry will help fend off a bigger and better-armed Russian war machine. “We must fully implement every agreement with our partners on weapons supplies,” Zelensky wrote, “as well as new special agreements on establishing joint manufacturing and building production facilities on partners' territories.”

Macron and Zelensky meet in The Hague
President Zelensky said he discussed missile supplies and funding for interceptor drones to counteract Russian attacks in a call with French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday. “I would especially like to highlight our agreement on pilot training for Mirage jets – France is ready to train additional pilots using additional aircraft,” Zelensky said on X, adding that the leaders also coordinated the next political steps.

The latest exchange between Zelensky and Macron came as the European Union agreed on an 18th package of sanctions against Russia over the war in Ukraine, including measures aimed at dealing further blows to the Russian oil and energy industry. Macron said the new sanctions package was unprecedented. “It is necessary more than ever before to remind ourselves that the security, freedom, and future of Europe are closely tied to the fate of Ukraine,” wrote Macron on X.

“In this regard, I welcome the adoption this morning by the European Union of an unprecedented new package of sanctions against Russia. Russian attacks must stop immediately,” he added.","Russia and Ukraine’s peace talks in 2025 yielded prisoner exchanges but no ceasefire or summit date. Both sides remain distant on terms, with Russia demanding territory concessions, while Ukraine seeks full withdrawal.

The city’s main airport briefly cancelled flights during the night, but didn’t cite the threat from drones, added the WSJ report.

Talks with Russia ‘need more momentum’
On Friday, July 18 — a day after the latest assault — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that peace negotiations with Russia needed ""more momentum"" and that he had asked new National Security and Defence Council secretary Rustem Umerov to ""intensify the negotiation track"". ""The implementation of the agreements from the second Istanbul meeting is ongoing,"" Zelenskiy wrote on X. “This process needs more momentum,” said the Ukrainian president.

The earlier rounds of talks between Russia and Ukraine in Turkey earlier this year have yielded little more than an agreement to exchange prisoners and soldiers' remains. No date has been set for a new round of talks, reported Reuters.

Russia unleashes largest aerial assault on Ukraine
Last week, Russia unleashed more than 700 drones and missiles across Ukraine, the largest such assault of the war, reported WSJ. The Russian strikes have also increasingly targeted the diplomatic and commercial sites linked to Ukraine’s Western allies — most recently Poland. On July 4, a drone hit the consular section of the Polish Embassy in Kyiv. No staff was injured. ","Russia claimed to have shot down 122 Ukrainian drones overnight on July 17, with targets over multiple Russian regions including Moscow and Crimea. Moscow's mayor confirmed three drones were intercepted near the capital, leading to temporary flight suspensions. Both nations continue intense drone attacks amid ongoing conflict and stalled peace talks.",International News

At least 18 persons were killed and over 80 injured as two bomb blasts ripped through a busy locality here this evening. The explosions occurred in quick succession at a crowded eatery near a theatre and at a foot over-bridge in the busy Dilsukhnagar area.

The first explosion occurred around 7.10 pm near Anand Tiffin Centre, spreading panic in the area. The two bombs, placed on bicycles, went off within a radius of 150 metres.

A third bomb, planted in a scooter near a theatre, was defused by the police. Police source said at least 18 persons died and over 80 injured in the incident. The condition of five injured was serious, Chief Minister N Kiran Kumar Reddy said.

City Deputy Commissioner of Police Ravi Verma said the bombs were planted on two bicycles - one near the eatery and another near the bus station. The bombs were kept in steel lunch boxes.

The police feared the death toll could rise as the condition of some of the injured was critical. The blasts, five minutes apart, occurred during rush hour, triggering panic in the area. Bomb disposal squads arrived at the scene and found a bomb planted in a scooter. The city police was put on high alert and mobile phone networks were jammed in and around Dilsukhnagar to prevent rumours.

“We will ensure stringent punishment to those who committed this dastardly act,” CM Reddy said. Teams of the National Security Guards (NSG) and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) also arrived in the city to conduct the probe. The local police suspected the involvement of Indian Mujahideen (IM) behind the blasts. The state government has announced an ex gratia of Rs 6 lakh to the next of kin of the dead and Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh to the injured.

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh condemned the blasts and said those behind the dastardly act will not go unpunished.

The Asian Age,2019-07-19 00:00:00,"Russia’s FaceApp worrying US leaders, calls for probe by FBI","New York, July 18: The chart-topping Russianmade FaceApp, which allows users to see how they will look as they age, found itself in the eye of a political storm in the US on Wednesday, with one senator urging an FBI investigation into its “national security and privacy risks”.

A celebrity favourite, the app deploys artificial intelligence to modify users' photos, adding wrinkles or subtracting years from their faces.

On Wednesday, US Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer sounded the alarm over FaceApp's Russian developer, calling for the FBI and the Federal Trade Commission to “look into the national security & privacy risks” connected to the application. “FaceApp’s location in Russia raises questions regarding how and when the company provides access to the data of US citizens to third parties, including potentially foreign governments,” the New York senator said in a letter to the FBI.

“It would be deeply troubling if the sensitive personal information of US citizens was provided to a hostile foreign power actively engaged in cyber

hostilities against the United States,” he added.

The Tribune,2013-03-23 00:00:00,"Hyderabad blasts rock Parliament Terror alert sent to Hyderabad, 3 other cities thrice: Shinde","New Delhi, February 22
Members in both Houses of Parliament cut across party lines on Friday to condemn the twin blasts in Hyderabad and asked the Centre to act on a war-footing to root out terror and ensure the accountability of intelligence mechanisms.

Pandemonium prevailed in both Houses as they met for the day, with angry members demanding a statement on the blasts from Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde. The members were informed that Shinde was in Hyderabad and would make a statement on his return in the post-lunch period. Shortly after he arrived in the National Capital, the Home Minister rushed to the Lok Sabha and then to the Rajya Sabha to make his statement.

Shinde, who is facing heat from the Opposition over the manner in which his ministry is tackling incidents of terror, said the Centre sent alerts to the states on February 16, 17 and 20 about the possibility of terror strikes in Hyderabad, Mumbai, Bangalore and Coimbatore. He said Intelligence agencies had lifted some clues from the blast sites, but these could not be shared in the interest of investigations. Emphasising that terror has no caste, colour or religion, Shinde made it clear that the government was determined to crush terrorism with a heavy hand and those behind the blasts would be brought to justice.

“The government is committed to combat such cowardly terror attack and it shall make all possible efforts to apprehend the perpetrators and masterminds of the blasts and ensure that they are punished as per the law,” he added.

The Home Minister strongly defended Intelligence agencies and went on to say that they were doing a commendable job. This could be confirmed from the fact that terror attacks in the country had come down, he said. “There were 11 terror strikes in 2008, four in 2011 and two in 2012. Infiltration from across the border has also dropped due to the measures taken by India,” he said.

Earlier, raising the issue of the twin blasts, Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Sushma Swaraj, sought to know from the government if the incidents had anything to do with the recent hate speech delivered in the state by MIM legislator Akbaruddin Owaisi. Saying that the Centre’s culpability in the matter increased manifold given that the Home Minister had Intelligence inputs of a terror attack, Swaraj dismissed his statement as “routine” and said it inspired no confidence.

“This is a routine statement. You took nine years to hang Afzal Guru and delayed the hanging due to political reasons. You now say you had the intelligence, but if you had intelligence, why did you not stop the attack? You said you are committed to banning the perpetrators and preventing attacks, but you display no resolve to that end,” she told Shinde.

JDU’s Sharad Yadav, TMC’s Sudeep Bandopadhyay, DMK’s TR Baalu and Shiv Sena’s Anant Geete asked the Centre what kind of intelligence it had shared with the states and why it was not more specific.

In the Upper House, an emotional M Venkaiah Naidu (BJP), who hails from Andhra Pradesh, alleged that the Hyderabad blasts were the handiwork of “our neighbour” and claimed that the government had no concrete roadmap to tackle terrorism. “The government is clueless about the activities of terrorists, who get support from our neighbour. They want to weaken India and cripple our economy,” he said. ","On February 22, 2013, both Houses of Parliament united in condemning the twin bomb blasts in Hyderabad’s Dilsukhnagar area, which killed at least 18 and injured over 80. Members across party lines demanded a strong response from the Centre and accountability from intelligence agencies. Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde, who visited the blast site, informed Parliament that alerts had been issued to states prior to the attack. He emphasized that terrorism has no religion and vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice. Opposition leaders, including Sushma Swaraj and Venkaiah Naidu, criticized the government for failing to act on intelligence inputs and questioned its resolve in combating terrorism. The incident reignited debates on national security, intelligence coordination, and political unity against terror.",Politics

North Korea has suspended foreigners’ access to a newly opened beach resort on its east coast, just days after Russia’s top diplomat visited the area and vowed to help increase tourist flows to the isolated country.

North Korea’s National Tourism Administration said the Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist Area that began operations this month is temporarily not accepting foreign guests, without elaborating. 

The beach resort is one of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s pet projects. Kim has a private mansion on the coast, and during construction of the facilities he often visited the site to oversee progress on a project that features about 7,000 guest rooms in luxury hotels and private villas, an outdoor waterpark and an airport, according to state media. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov visited the resort town during his recent North Korea trip in which he met with Kim on the leader’s yacht. Lavrov said at a meeting with his North Korean counterpart in Wonsan that Russia will “do everything” to expand the flow of Russian tourists to North Korea. 

Tourism is a key revenue source for the sanctions-hit Kim regime but the country has been allowing only a trickle of inbound tourists from Russia since it began easing its pandemic border restrictions. North Korean authorities keep close tabs on overseas visitors, who are usually required to stay at lodgings designated for use by foreigners and restricted in their movements in the country. 

President Donald Trump also floated a coastal real estate development plan in exchange for a North Korean pledge to denuclearize during his first summit with Kim in 2018. 

“They have great beaches,” Trump said at a news conference at that time. “You see that whenever they’re exploding their cannons into the ocean, right? I said, ‘Boy, look at that view. Wouldn’t that make a great condo?’” he added. 

Trump’s real estate diplomacy with Kim produced few results, however. The two leaders met in person three times, but the discussions didn’t persuade Kim to slow the development of his nuclear weapons program. North Korea has since rebuffed the idea of sitting down with the US again and has emerged as a key ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, supporting his war on Ukraine. ","North Korea has abruptly suspended foreign tourist access to its newly opened Wonsan-Kalma Coastal Tourist Area, just weeks after launch and days after Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov’s visit. No official reason was given; analysts suggest concerns over negative foreign media and incomplete development may be factors, despite tourism being vital for revenue.",International News

Two days after the twin bomb blasts rocked a busy locality in Hyderabad, killing 16 persons and injuring over 120, the investigators today found “vital clues” from the closed circuit television cameras located at a traffic signal near the blast site.

The CCTV footage showed “some persons” moving around in a suspicious manner at the crowded Dilsukhnagar area where two bomb explosions had occurred in quick succession. A middle-aged man was seen moving with a bag hung on his bicycle.

He was seen reaching the place 10 minutes before the first blast that ripped through Anand Tiffin Centre in front of Konark theatre at 6.38 pm. The second blast occurred a few meters away at 7.01 pm. However, the faces of the suspects are not clear in the footage. The police has sought the help of experts to sharpen the footage, city Police Commissioner Anurag Sharma told reporters.

The mobile call records from the area at the time of the explosions are also being examined. The city police has constituted 15 teams, each comprising 10 to 15 officers, to track down the culprits even as the needle of suspicion pointed towards the involvement of Indian Mujahideen (IM) in the blasts.

The Police Commissioner, however, said no arrests had been made so far. “We are examining the CCTV footage, near the blast site and we have found some clues. We are not in a haste to blame anyone,” he said. The police also announced Rs 10 lakh reward for any information leading to the arrest of the perpetrators of the twin blasts.

“We have already gathered vital clues in the case. We are confident that we will crack the case soon,” said state Home Minister P Sabita Indra Reddy after a high-level review meeting chaired by Chief Minister N Kiran Kumar Reddy.

The Police Commissioner refuted media reports that CCTV wires had been snapped before the blasts. He, however, admitted that out of 303 CCTVs installed in the city, 38 were not functioning.

Asked about the possible involvement of IM, he said, “The investigations are underway. Unless we complete the process, we cannot jump to conclusion.” Ammonium nitrate was used in the IEDs which had timers, he said.

About the reports that the state police had failed to act on the alerts issued by the Central intelligence inputs on the possible terror strikes in the city, the Commissioner said they had received an alert from Delhi on February 15 about possible strikes in Hyderabad and three other cities.

“We did not take any warning lightly.” A high alert has been sounded in the city and the surrounding districts. Security, particularly in the vulnerable areas like crowded markets, malls and cinema halls, has been beefed up.

The Telegraph,2025-07-18 00:00:00,‘Gringo’: Brazil PM Lula rejects Donald Trump's ‘blackmail’ 50% tariff; says ‘will not take orders from a foreigner’,"Brazilian President Lula da Silva rejected US tariffs, calling them unacceptable blackmail. He emphasised Brazil's sovereignty and criticised tech firms, asserting they spread violence and misinformation.  Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Thursday said that he would not take tariff directives from a “foreign leader”, referring to US President Donald Trump.

Reuters reported that Lula further slammed the US's proposed 50% duty as “unacceptable blackmail.”

His remarks, delivered at two different events, reflect the ongoing tensions between the two presidents, which intensified after the US imposed a steep tariff on Brazil last week.

In a post on X, Lula wrote, “There are no winners in trade wars. We are a country of peace, without enemies. We believe in multilateralism and cooperation among nations. But let no one forget: Brazil has only one owner — the Brazilian people.” Trump attributed the tariff, set to start in August, to Brazil's treatment of former President Jair Bolsonaro and to trade practices against US companies that he said are unfair. The tariff announcement came days after Lula called Trump an ""emperor"" the world does not want.

Lula and his cabinet members have dismissed the justification for the tariffs, emphasising Brazil's sovereignty and urging trade negotiations with the United States.

“No foreigner is going to give orders to this president,” Lula said in a speech, using the slang word ‘gringo’, which in Brazil is a common term for foreigners without the pejorative sense it carries in other parts of Latin America. He added that Brazil would go ahead with the regulation and taxation of US tech firms, telling a gathering of leftist student activists in the state of Goias that tech firms are conduits of violence and fake news disguised as freedom of expression, Reuters reported.

Later on Thursday, during an evening TV and radio address to the nation, Lula said the defence of Brazil's sovereignty extends to protecting itself against the actions of foreign digital platforms. During the nearly five-minute address, Lula said Brazil has been negotiating with the US over tariffs, and repeated that the Latin American country had sent a proposal in May, Reuters reported.“We expected a response, and what we received was unacceptable blackmail, in the form of threats to Brazilian institutions and false information about trade between Brazil and the United States,” Lula said.

Brasilia has been holding discussions with industry groups and companies that will be affected by the US tariff, while also readying potential retaliatory measures if talks fall through. Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira told CNN Brasil separately on Thursday that Lula was open to talks with Trump, who had not yet met each other. “If the circumstances are given, they will speak,” he added. Lula, who is in his third non-consecutive term as president of Latin America's largest economy, saw his approval ratings start to rebound after the trade spat with Trump last week.

","Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva rejected the US’s planned 50% tariff hike as “unacceptable blackmail” and vowed not to take orders from a “foreign leader”. He emphasized Brazil’s sovereignty, criticized US tech firms for spreading violence and misinformation, and pledged to regulate and tax their operations in Brazil. Lula called for trade talks but warned of potential retaliatory measures if the US tariffs proceed, reiterating that “Brazil has only one owner — the Brazilian people”.

Three days after the twin bomb blasts rocked Hyderabad, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh flew down to the city today to inspect the blast sites and consoled the victims undergoing treatment in two hospitals.

During the brief visit, the Prime Minister praised the people of Hyderabad for maintaining calm and refusing to be provoked by the nefarious act of terrorists.

He spent about five minutes at Anand Tiffin Centre in Dilsukhnagar where the first explosion had occurred on Thursday. Chief Minister N Kiran Kumar Reddy, Director-General of Police V Dinesh Reddy and other officials briefed him about the incident and the progress of the ongoing probe.

Singh then walked down to the bus shelter near Venkatadri theatre, the scene of the second blast, about 150 metres away. The twin blasts had ripped through the crowded area, killing 16 persons and injuring over 120.

“I am here to stand in solidarity with the people of the city. I call upon the people to maintain calm in this hour of grief,” he said.

After inspecting the blast sites, the Prime Minister visited two private hospitals - Yashoda and Omni - and met the injured undergoing treatment. He spent about 25 minutes at the two hospitals, interacting with the patients and the doctors.

Singh assured the patients that the best possible treatment would be provided to them. He was briefed about the condition of each patient and the treatment being given to them.

Earlier, the Prime Minister, who landed at the old Begumpet airport by a special aircraft from Delhi around 11 am, was received, among others, by Governor ESL Narasimhan, Chief Minister N Kiran Kumar Reddy, and ministers P Lakshmaiah, Dr J Geeta Reddy and P Sabitha Indra Reddy. From Begumpet, the Prime Minister took a chopper to Victoria Memorial Home in Saroornagar. From there, he drove to Dilsukhnagar, the place where twin blasts took place.

“I pray for the speedy recovery of the injured. To those who died, I send my condolences to the bereaved families. I have been assured by the state government that the best possible medical care is being made available to the injured,” Singh said.

Consoling the mother of one of the injured K Parmeshwar, he said all possible care would be provided to her son. “The staff will take all possible care of your son,” he told her. He also held a review meeting with the Chief Minister and other state ministers.

The Asian Age,2019-07-31 00:00:00,Mystery as CCD’s owner missing,"Karnataka, and the rest of India, woke up to a massive shock on Tuesday morning soon after news spread that V.G. Siddhartha, founder of the Cafe Coffee Day (CCD) chain, the Indian rival to Starbucks, and son-in-law of former chief minister S.M. Krishna, had gone missing near a bridge over the river Netravathi in Mangaluru on Monday evening.

Siddhartha is yet to be traced with a herculean search operation now being carried out by personnel of the Indian Navy, Coast Guard, police and local fishermen in the swirling waters of the Netravathi. They are acting on the suspicion that Siddhartha may have taken his own life by jumping into the river at a point, barely 2 km from the sea, as a letter by him alluding to pressures from a private equity investor to buy back shares have left many questions answered.

The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), home guards, fire department and the coastal police too are involved in this operation which is proving extremely difficult because of the rains and the fact that the river has a width of 1 km at the spot where Siddhartha was last seen before it enters the Arabian Sea.

Siddhartha’s driver, Basavaraja Patil, who filed a missing person’s complaint at the Kankanady police station in Mangaluru on Monday midnight, said he had taken his employer to the CCD office at Vittal Mallya Road at 8 am and returned home at 11 am on July 29. As Siddhartha wanted to go to his village in Chikkamagaluru, he asked the driver to bring his luggage and they left at 12.30 pm in a Toyota Innova, leaving his regular driver and car behind.

The dramatic sequence of events began when they were about to reach Sakaleshpur in Hassan. Siddhartha asked the driver to continue driving and go to Mangaluru instead. “When we reached the circle at the entrance of Mangaluru (Mahaveera Circle), he (Siddhartha) asked me to take a left turn as he wanted to go to his site (the CCD owner owns a property at Ullal),” the driver explained.

“When we reached Ullal bridge on Kerala Highway, he asked me to stop the car before the bridge and asked me to wait at the other end as he wanted to walk. He

stepped out and asked me to stay in the car. He crossed the road to reach the other lane going towards Mangaluru and started walking on the bridge. I waited, but when he did not return by about 8 pm, I tried calling him. His number was switched off,” Basavaraja said. Sources said the CCD chief left all his personal possessions behind in the car, only carrying his mobile telephone with him.

The panicked driver then called Siddhartha’s son Amarthya Hegde, who said that he would call his dad. By then Coffee Day officer Pradeep Shetty had also reached the spot. Not finding Siddhartha anywhere, the officials and family members held a discussion and decided to lodge a complaint with the police.

Mangaluru police commissioner Sandeep Patil, who is supervising the rescue operations, said a dog squad was used during the search. “It stopped in the middle of the bridge. We are contacting all those to whom he spoke to before he went missing,” he said. Four teams have been formed by the police chief to probe the shocking incident from all angles. Sources said the last tower on which Siddhartha’s mobile signal was active was Jeppinamogaru — which is near the bridge where he was last seen.

Based on a request from the Dakshina Kannada deputy commissioner, the Indian Navy has deployed two Gemini boats and a Navy diving team from its Karwar base. The coast guard has stationed ICGS Savitribai Phule, a fast patrol vessel, off the Old Mangalore Port to maintain a sharp vigil close to the mouth of the harbour. Coast Guard ship Kasturba Gandhi too has been kept as a standby for deployment off the Old Mangalore port.

A fisherman has claimed that he saw a person falling from the bridge over the Netravathi river at around 7 pm. The fisherman, Simon D’Souza, who stays near the bridge, was fishing in the Netravathi on Monday evening. “It was around 7 pm and I was near the 6th pillar of the bridge. I saw a person falling into the river near the 8th pillar. I do not know who he was. I tried to rescue him but failed as he was far away from my boat. He sank in the water,” Simon claimed.

Netravathi bridge is known as a suicide spot. Siddhartha, who did his education in Mangaluru and owns property here, knows the city pretty well, said sources.

Mangaluru police commissioner Sandeep Patil said on Tuesday that a police team has left for Bengaluru to conduct an inquiry and question the office staff and relatives. Asked about the letter purportedly written by Siddhartha to CCD’s board of directors, the commissioner told reporters: “Siddhartha’s family gave us the letter, so it has to be genuine. We are inquiring into its contents also, for which a team has gone to Bengaluru.” Mr Patil said the team headed to Bengaluru will conduct an inquiry of the office staff and relatives and gather all information. “A detailed technical investigation is also going on,” he said.

In Bengaluru, chief minister B.S. Yediyurappa, former chief minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda and scores of leaders, including Congress leaders Siddaramaiah and D.K. Shivakumar visited, Mr S.M. Krishna’s Bengaluru residence after coming to know about Siddhartha going missing.

Meanwhile, a letter written by the Cafe Coffee Day owner a few days before he went missing has triggered doubts that financial problems could be the reason for any extreme step Siddhartha could have taken. “I have failed as an entrepreneur,” he said in the letter purportedly written to the board and employees of Coffee Day Enterprises. “After 37 years, with strong commitment to hard work, having directly created 30,000 jobs in our companies and their subsidiaries, as well as 20,000 jobs in a technology company where I have been a large shareholder since its founding, I have failed to create the right profitable business model despite my best efforts... Today I gave up as I could not take any more pressure from one of the private equity partners forcing me to buy back shares, a transaction I had partially completed six months ago by borrowing a large sum of money from a friend,” he said.","V.G. Siddhartha, founder of Café Coffee Day and son-in-law of former Karnataka CM S.M. Krishna, went missing near the Netravathi river in Mangaluru, triggering a massive multi-agency search operation. His driver said Siddhartha walked onto a bridge and never returned. A fisherman claimed to have seen someone fall into the river. A letter reportedly written by Siddhartha suggested financial stress and pressure from a private equity investor. Authorities are investigating all angles, while political leaders have expressed concern and visited the family.",Crime and Justice

Mint,2025-07-18 00:00:00,Who was Felix Baumgartner? Austrian skydiver who jumped from space in 2012 dies at 56,"Felix Baumgartner, the Austrian skydiver known for his 2012 high altitude jump, died at 56 in a paraglider crash in Italy. He was the first to break the sound barrier during a 24-mile descent, achieving fame as 'Fearless Felix' for his extreme flight feats. Felix Baumgartner, the Austrian adventurer who jumped from space in 2012, died at the age of 56. Following a 24-mile leap attempt, Felix Baumgartner became the first skydiver to fall faster than the speed of sound through the stratosphere. As per AP report, he was killed in a crash on July 17.

The incident was reported from the Italian city of Porto Sant Elpidio. According to Italian firefighters, a paraglider crashed along the eastern coast of Italy into the side of a swimming pool. Confirming Felix Baumgartner's death, the city's mayor Massimiliano Ciarpella in a social media post stated, “Our community is deeply affected by the tragic disappearance of Felix Baumgartner, a figure of global prominence, a symbol of courage and passion for extreme flight."" Fearless Felix
Popularly known as “Fearless Felix,” the skydiver shot to fame after he participated in a nine-minute descent during which he launched himself from a capsule hoisted more than 24 miles (39 kilometres) above Earth by a giant helium balloon over New Mexico. With this stunt, he became the first human to not only break the sound barrier record but also the first skydiver to undertake the highest-ever jump. The previous high altitude jump record was set in 1960 by Joe Kittinger, who served as an adviser to the Ausie skydiver during this feat.

Part of the Red Bull Stratos team, he topped out at 843.6 mph which is equivalent of 1.25 times the speed of sound. Felix Baumgartn's crew later revealed that the skydiver went into a potentially dangerous flat spin at one point while still supersonic - spinning for 13 seconds during the record breaking skydive. He attempted this stunt in 2012 by wearing a pressurized suit and after landing in the eastern New Mexico desert had said, “When I was standing there on top of the world, you become so humble, you do not think about of breaking records anymore, you do not think of about gaining scientific data. The only thing you want is to come back alive,” AP reported.

However, Felix Baumgartner's highest free-fall jump record was broken two years later by Google executive Alan Eustace.

Born on April 20, 1969, the former Austrian military parachutist, made several jumps during his lifetime.

 The Asian Age,2019-01-22 00:00:00,Anti- Modi Opp. alliance spells ‘ chaos’: Jaitley,"With the Lok Sabha elections fast approaching and the BJP’s poll strategy focusing on the leadership qualities of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government’s “achievements”, senior BJP leader and Union finance minister Arun Jaitley said Monday that the Opposition parties were coming together only to oppose Mr Modi and “spread negativity”, which an aspirational nation would never opt for as it never commits “collective suicide”.

In an article “Agenda for 2019: Modi vs Chaos” on his Facebook page, Mr Jaitley wrote that the Opposition had only two strategies — “a negative anti- Modi agenda” and to take the best advantage of the electoral arithmetic by joining forces. Referring to the recent Opposition rally at Kolkata’s Brigade Parade Ground, Mr Jaitley said “negativism was the flavour”, adding that a

negative campaign only

“It is only the fear of his popularity and comeback that is bringing them ( the Opposition parties) together. The Prime Minister remains by far the most popular, decisive and dynamic leader of the present set of politicians. His integrity, emphasis on ethics, decisiveness, growth- oriented politics has made aspirational India accept him. The Opposition is making the PM’s continuation in office a key political issue. We in the BJP welcome this,” the senior leader wrote, adding that if negativism is the political theme in an aspirational nation, it would not work. “If arithmetic is the only hope, the Modi chemistry can prevail over it,” said the senior leader, who is now in the United States for a medical checkup.

Recalling the 1971 general election, Mr Jaitley said the then Opposition had formed a “grand alliance” against then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.

He said Opposition politics had thrown up four leaders desiring to be Prime Minister who wished to challenge Mr Modi, and said only the fear of Mr Modi’s popularity and “certain comeback” had brought the Opposition parties together. He said the anti- Modi rally organised in Kolkata had significantly become “a non- Rahul Gandhi rally” due to his conspicuous absence. “All four ambitious politicians pursue fanciful strategies to replace Mr Modi; however the Congress can at best dream only to be a pillion rider,” he noted.

“Negativism was writ large in their approach. The strategy of each of the four contenders ( Mamata Banerjee, Rahul Gandhi, Mayawati and KCR) is clear... The individual strategy of each one of the above appears to be the same. Replace Mr Modi and get on to the driver’s seat,” he added.","With Lok Sabha elections nearing, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley criticized the Opposition for uniting solely to oppose Prime Minister Narendra Modi, accusing them of spreading “negativity.” In a Facebook article titled “Agenda for 2019: Modi vs Chaos,” Jaitley argued that Modi’s popularity, leadership, and integrity make him the preferred choice for aspirational India. He dismissed the Opposition's alliance as lacking a positive agenda and driven by fear of Modi’s return, likening it to the 1971 grand alliance against Indira Gandhi.",Politics

Mint,2025-07-18 00:00:00,US designates Pakistani group LeT's proxy The Resistance Front as global terrorists over Pahalgam attack,"The US has designated The Resistance Front (TRF), a proxy of Lashkar-e-Taiba, as a Foreign Terrorist Organization over its role in the April 22 Pahalgam massacre in Kashmir that killed 26 civilians. The United States on Thursday (July 17) designated The Resistance Front (TRF) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) and Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT), citing its role in the April 22 Pahalgam massacre in Kashmir that killed 26 civilians.

Announcing the designation, Secretary of State Marco Rubio described TRF as a “front and proxy” of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), which is already listed as a terrorist group by both the United Nations and the United States.

“These actions demonstrate the Trump administration’s commitment to protecting our national security interests, countering terrorism, and enforcing President Trump’s call for justice for the Pahalgam attack,” Rubio said in a statement.

Pahalgam massacre triggers global outrage
The Pahalgam terror attack shocked the region. Survivors told media that armed militants targeted Hindu civilians, reportedly separating women and children before ordering male victims to recite the Muslim declaration of faith. Most of the 26 victims were Hindus.

TRF claimed responsibility for the massacre shortly after, though little was previously known about the group, a “smokescreen” created by LeT to operate under a different name and mask its Pakistan-based support.

India strikes back, Pakistan denies role
In response to the Pahalgam killings, India launched Operation Sindoor, targeted strikes on terror networks across the Line of Control and into Pakistani territory. While Islamabad condemned the violence, it denied any connection to the attack or to TRF’s operations.

The US designation puts additional pressure on Pakistan to crack down on terror proxies operating from its soil. It also enables US authorities to block TRF’s assets and prohibit material support to the group.

The announcement marks a significant diplomatic step by the Trump administration, which has repeatedly signaled closer security ties with India amid shared concerns about regional terrorism and cross-border militancy.","The U.S. has designated The Resistance Front (TRF), a Lashkar-e-Taiba proxy, as a Foreign Terrorist Organization following its role in the April 22 Pahalgam massacre that killed 26 civilians in Kashmir.

With the decline in flights for business or pleasure due to the ongoing pandemic, airlines that are attempting to maintain market share are complaining about the ‘ghost flights’ they are being forced to fly.

An EU regulation that dates back to 1993 requires European airlines to maintain empty or near-empty flights just to retain their take-off and landing slots. This is done to avoid the slots from being handed over to other airlines that might be competitors or new market entrants. Usually, these airlines are required to use up to 80 per cent of their slots to secure them. Owing to the pandemic, this threshold was temporarily reduced to 50 per cent of booked flights but as soon as this winter ends in March 2022, it is set to once again increase to 64 per cent. Essentially, airline operators have to prove that they have adequate market demand that justifies their holdings. According to the European Commission’s website, this ‘use it or lose it’ system is employed “to ensure that airlines have access to the busiest EU airports on the basis of principles of neutrality, transparency and non-discrimination.”
