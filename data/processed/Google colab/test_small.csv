The New Indian Express,2025-01-05 00:00:00,Austrian Chancellor Nehammer to resign after coalition talks fail,"Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer announced on Saturday that he will step down as chancellor and leader of the conservative People’s Party in the coming days after failing to form a new government.

The announcement came after coalition talks between the People’s Party and the Social Democrats ended without an agreement, a day after the liberal Neos party withdrew from negotiations.

“Destructive forces in the Social Democratic Party have gained the upper hand,” Nehammer stated on social media, adding that his party would not support a program that undermines economic competitiveness.

Social Democratic leader Andreas Babler expressed regret over the breakdown of negotiations, saying it was a missed opportunity for Austria. Babler emphasised the need for urgent economic reforms, including addressing a budget deficit of 3.7% of GDP, which exceeds the EU’s limit of 3%.

The coalition talks began in October after Austria’s president asked Nehammer to form a government. This followed the far-right Freedom Party’s September electoral victory with 29.2% of the vote, making it the largest party but leaving others unwilling to form a coalition with it.

Austria has been in a recession for two years, with rising unemployment and a need to save €18–24 billion, according to the EU Commission.

Nehammer’s resignation marks the end of months of political deadlock in Austria.

Indian Express ,2025-01-05 00:00:00,"Chhattisgarh: Three arrested over murder of journalist, property of key accused razed","Chattisgarh Home Minister Vijay Sharma in a press conference on Saturday alleged the main accused in the case, Suresh Chandrakar, is a Congress leader.A day after police discovered the body of 32-year-old journalist Mukesh Chandrakar in a septic tank in Chhattisgarh’s Bijapur district, three persons have been arrested, with the district authorities also bulldozing alleged “illegal property” belonging to a key accused, Suresh Chandrakar. State Home Minister Vijay Sharma said Suresh is a Congress leader — a charge denied by the party, which claimed he joined the BJP in December.

While Suresh is on the run, the three arrested accused have been identified as his brothers Ritesh Chandrakar and Dinesh Chandrakar, and construction supervisor Mahendra Ramteke. Police said it was Mukesh’s cousin Ritesh who allegedly committed the murder with help from Mahendra, while Dinesh and Suresh helped dispose of the body.

“Ritesh was angry that despite being brothers, Mukesh was interfering in their work. This led to a heated argument during which he was killed,” said a senior police officer.At a press conference on Saturday, Chhattisgarh Home Minister Vijay Sharma said Mukesh had on December 25 reported about poor construction work on a road project where Suresh was a contractor.Sources said the 52.4 km project on the Nelson-Kodoli-Mirtur-Gangalur route was commissioned by the Public Works Department in 2010 at a cost of Rs 73 crore, but by 2021, the revised estimate had shot up to Rs 189 crore. Suresh was given the work order for a section of the road in 2015.

Sharma said, “The day Mukesh reported on the road construction, an inquiry was ordered. We will conduct a thorough probe.”

He said an 11-member Special Investigation Team led by an IPS officer has been constituted, and the case will be fast-tracked in court.Sharma said Suresh is a Congress leader in charge of Bijapur. Responding to this, Congress’s communications head for Chattisgarh, Sushil Anand Shukla, said, “(Suresh) Chandrakar was a Congress party worker, but he joined the BJP in December.”

A senior official from the Chhattisgarh government told The Indian Express, “In the aftermath of the murder, Chief Minister Vishnudev Sai decided to send a strong message against criminals. It was on his directive that the administration demolished a road construction plant of the main accused.”

A senior official from district administration said, “The razed property belongs to the main accused Suresh Chandrakar, who has taken up several road construction projects in the past and currently has tenders for three road projects. The razed property was a construction yard made by encroaching on forest land. It was used to make materials used in road construction work. The property was spread across over 3 acres. There were several vehicles, sheds, hardware materials and a hot mix plant. The action was jointly taken by forest and revenue officials. We are checking if he has more illegal property. He is on the run, and we have frozen three of his bank accounts.”

Chandrakar’s body was found in a septic tank on Suresh’s residential premises.The freelancer had worked with media houses such as NDTV and News 18 in the past and also had his own YouTube channel, Bastar Junction, with 1.59 lakh subscribers.

Anurag Dwary, Resident Editor, NDTV, said: “As a journalist, my colleague paid the ultimate price for exposing the truth. It’s a stark reminder of the risks journalists take daily in pursuit of accountability. We stand in solidarity with his family, and we demand a swift and impartial investigation to bring those responsible to justice.”

Mukesh played a crucial role in the release of CoBRA commando Rakeshwar Singh Manhas from Maoist captivity in April 2021 following the Takalguda Naxal ambush in Bijapur in which 22 security personnel were killed.

On Saturday, more than 50 journalists came together at the Raipur Press Club, from where they marched to Raj Bhawan and submitted a memorandum seeking safeguards for journalists.The murder was also condemned by the Editors Guild of India, the Press Club of India and the Indian Women’s Press Corps.","Chhattisgarh journalist Mukesh Chandrakar, who reported on road construction corruption, was found murdered in a septic tank in Bijapur.

The New Indian Express,2025-01-05 00:00:00,Bangladesh’s EC to probe Awami League-era national elections,"Bangladesh’s Election Commission (EC) has decided to investigate irregularities and shortcomings in all previous elections, including the three preceding elections that have been controversial during the Awami League-rule in 2014, 2018 and 2024.

The Dhaka Tribune newspaper reported that following a meeting, Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) AMM Nasir Uddin instructed all 10 regional election officers to examine the reasons behind the decline in the electoral system and submit detailed reports.

The CEC issued written directives, asking regional officials to identify past irregularities and deficiencies and report their findings to the EC secretariat.

The 2014, 2018 and 2024 national elections are widely regarded as some of the most controversial in the country’s history.

The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) of former prime minister Khaleda Zia and allied parties boycotted the 2014 election, resulting in one-sided voting and unopposed election of 153 candidates, an unprecedented occurrence in the country’s electoral history.

The 2018 election was marred by allegations of rigging and came to be known as the “midnight election”, with the BNP and its allies winning only seven seats.

The BNP and like-minded parties abstained from participating in the January 2024 election that faced criticism for allegedly fielding dummy candidates from the ruling Awami League as opposition representatives. As a result, the Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League managed to secure a fourth consecutive term in office.

Following the reconstitution of the EC, demands for a thorough investigation into these elections were raised by civil society, media representatives, and prominent individuals. They stressed the need for electoral reforms and accountability to restore public trust.

In his directive to officials, the CEC emphasised the importance of delivering free, fair, and impartial elections. CEC Nasir Uddin asked the electoral officers to adopt the good practices and discard the bad ones.

“The EC is committed to earning the nation’s trust by delivering transparent elections. Field officers must always be prepared to organise elections at short notice,” he said.

The newly formed EC, which assumed office on November 21, has already initiated several reform measures while preparing for the 13th National Election.

A few days ago, CEC Nasir Uddin said that ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League may participate in elections unless the government or the judiciary issues a ban against the party.

Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, 84, who was sworn-in to lead the interim government after the ouster of Hasina in August, during his Victory Day speech on December 16 indicated that elections might be held by early 2026.

“Broadly speaking, the election can be scheduled between the end of 2025 and the first half of 2026,” he said. Yunus said that the elections would be held after updating the voters’ list.","Bangladesh's Election Commission (EC) has launched an investigation into irregularities in all previous elections, including the controversial 2014, 2018, and 2024 polls during the Awami League's rule.

The New Indian Express,2025-01-05 00:00:00,Cyber slavery case: NIA conducts raids in Delhi's Jamia Nagar,"NEW DELHI: The anti-terror federal probe agency NIA has conducted raids at the home of a recently arrested accused as part of its probe into a human trafficking and cyber slavery case in Delhi’s Jamia Nagar area, officials said on Sunday.

The raids, which started on Saturday led to the recovery of digital devices (mobile phones or tablets) and other incriminating financial documents, including debit cards, passbooks and chequebooks of multiple banks, they said.

According to the officials, the case pertains to an alleged criminal conspiracy by Kamran Haider and other accused persons engaged in sending vulnerable Indian youth to the Golden Triangle Region in Lao PDR.

The victims of the racket were forced to commit cyber scams in Lao PDR, targeting European and US citizens, they added.

The NIA, in its probe, has so far revealed that Haider had facilitated the entire operation and was also involved in extorting money through cryptocurrency wallets from the victims, who had tried to escape the clutches of the Chinese scammers, the officials said.

Meanwhile, in another case the NIA has arrested a cadre of the Popular Front of India (PFI) for channelising funds from Dubai for the banned outfit to further its subversive activities in India, the officials said.

“The NIA arrested Mohammad Sajjad Alam of East Champaran district, Bihar, on Saturday as soon as he landed at the Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport here from Dubai, UAE on Saturday late night,” a senior official said.

An arrest warrant had been issued against Alam, a cadre of the PFI, by a special NIA court, he added.

According to the NIA officials, the accused was involved in channelising illegal funds from Dubai to PFI cadres in Bihar through a UAE, Karnataka and Kerala-based syndicate and such funds were used for promoting the banned outfit’s ""criminal and unlawful activities.""

The case, which was initially registered by Phulwari Sharif police in Bihar in July 2022, relates to PFI cadres’ involvement in ""unlawful and anti-national activities.""

According to NIA, the cadres allegedly conspired to create an atmosphere of terror and spread religious enmity between members of different religions through activities ""prejudicial to the maintenance of peace and harmony"" in the country.","The NIA raided a cyber slavery accused’s home in Delhi, recovering digital devices and financial documents tied to trafficking Indian youth for scams in Lao PDR.

Indian Express ,2025-01-05 00:00:00,2 local BJP leaders killed after truck rams into their car ‘three times’ in Odisha,"Police in Sambalpur seize truck, detain driver, say looking into whether incident was intentional.Two local BJP leaders were killed near Odisha’s Sambalpur late on Saturday night as the car they were travelling in was rammed by a tipper truck, allegedly three times.

The BJP leaders, Devendra Nayak and Muralidhar Chhuria, were close associates of former Rengali MLA and senior BJP leader Nauri Nayak. The incident took place when they, along with four others, were returning from Bhubaneswar, said police sources.

Suresh Chand, who was among those in the car and is undergoing treatment at a private clinic in Sambalpur, said, “The truck first hit our car from the side and later from behind after a gap of 100 metres. We believed this to be intentional and we diverted our car to an interior road from the highway near Kantapalli square. Still, the truck chased our vehicle and hit it again, following which our vehicle overturned.”Chand alleged that the ramming was intentional, saying, “By mistake one can hit a vehicle once, but not thrice.”Police said they have seized the truck and detained the driver, who is being questioned. The truck was carrying fly ash from a private company, sources said.Sambalpur SP Mukesh Kumar Bhamoo, the police have registered a case based on the complaint by the family members of the deceased. “We will investigate the matter as per allegations of the family members of the deceased, who suspect there could be a conspiracy.

The Telegraph ,2025-01-05 00:00:00,Drop Kohli and 'give a youngster a chance': Pathan sick of Virat making same mistakes,"We need to end superstar culture, we need team culture, says the former pacer.Lambasting Virat Kohli for neither playing domestic cricket nor working hard to iron out the technical flaws in his game, former pacer Irfan Pathan on Sunday questioned star batter's place in the side and called for an end to the superstar culture in the Indian team.

Kohli and Rohit Sharma were woefully out of form during the just-concluded Test series against Australia. The 1-3 defeat resulted in team losing out on qualifying for the World Test Championship final.Kohli could manage only 190 runs in his nine innings in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, repeatedly offering edges to the slip cordon or keeper.

""We need to end superstar culture, we need team culture. You need to improve yourself and improve the Indian team. There were matches before this series, too, and they had an opportunity to play domestic cricket, but they didn't. We need to change that culture,"" Pathan told Star Sports.

The former all-rounder said even the great Sachin Tendulkar played Ranji Trophy even when it wasn't required of him only because he wanted to spend that much time -- four or five days -- on the pitch ""When was the last time Virat Kohli played domestic cricket? (the host points out that Kohli's last first-class appearance for Delhi was in 2012) It has been more than a decade.""

Pathan went to the extent of saying that maybe Kohli's place should be given to a youngster, given that he has averaged less than 30 in first innings in the last five years.

""For the Indian team in 2024, in the first innings where you basically set up the match, Virat Kohli’s average is 15. And if you consider his average over the last five years, it's not even 30.

""Does the Indian team deserve its senior player? Instead, give a youngster a chance. Tell him to get ready. He will also give an average of 25–30. This is about the team, not the individuals."" Pathan also questioned if Kohli was even serious to improve.

""When we talk about Virat Kohli, he has done a lot for India. He has delivered many performances. But you are getting out from the same mistake again and again.

""You are not creating a gap between two mistakes. You are not trying to fix the technical mistake. Sunny sir is in the field. How long does it take to talk to Sunny Sir or someone?"" Australia beat India by six wickets in the fifth and final Test to regain the Border Gavaskar trophy.","Former pacer Irfan Pathan criticized Virat Kohli's form, questioning his place in the Indian team and advocating for an end to the ""superstar culture."" Pathan highlighted Kohli's technical flaws, lack of domestic cricket, and poor averages in recent years, suggesting opportunities for younger players to prioritize team culture over individual prominence.",Sports,51,429
The New Indian Express,2025-01-05 00:00:00,Home Affairs Ministry mandates chartered accountants to report FCRA violations in their audits,"NEW DELHI: The Foreigner's Division of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has announced that Chartered Accountants (CAs) filing audit returns on behalf of NGOs must specify whether the organization has violated provisions of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 (FCRA), officials said on Sunday.

The officials said that the provisions of the FCRA mandate a CA to certify if an association or NGO has utilised foreign contributions received for the purposes it was registered for and the annual statements are to be uploaded on the FCRA portal.

In the notification dated December 31, 2024, a copy of which is with the TNIE, the foreigners’ division said, “CAs will have to mention the name, email address, registration number of the auditor while issuing the audit certificate”.

It further said, “CAs will have to specify if the NGO has violated the provisions of FCRA, 2010 or rules made there under or notifications issued thereunder mentioning the details of the violations.” The auditors will also have to specify if the NGO has not made any violation, it added.

“I have examined all relevant books and records, including the items mentioned in column 8 of FC-4, and to the best of my knowledge and belief (name of the person/ association) has not violated any provisions of the FCRA, thereunder or notifications issued thereunder.” The notification amends the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Rules, 2011.

However, commenting on the new rules as notified, a member of an NGO said this would make it more difficult for voluntary organisations, which are critical of the government, to find auditors to file returns on their behalf.

Earlier in 2021, the MHA advised chartered accountants to ensure that foreign funds are received and utilised by NGOs “within the four corners of law”.

However, the current notification allows NGOs an option to carry forward the unspent part of permissible administrative expenses in a financial year to the immediately succeeding financial year. As per the rules, the FCRA allows only 20 per cent of foreign funds to be spent on administrative expenses in a designated bank account with the State Bank of India (SBI).

It is to be noted here that since 2015 the FCRA registration of more than 16,000 NGOs have been cancelled on account of “violation” of one or the other provisions of the Act.

Incidentally, the FCRA registration is a mandatory requirement for voluntary organisations to receive donations or funds from overseas entities.","The MHA now mandates Chartered Accountants auditing NGOs to specify compliance with FCRA rules in audit certificates, detailing any violations. While NGOs can carry forward unspent administrative funds, critics say the rule adds scrutiny, making it harder for NGOs to find auditors. Over 16,000 NGOs have lost FCRA registration since 2015.",Politics,51,405
Indian Express ,2025-01-05 00:00:00,Richa Chadha answers the age old question: ‘How do you know he’s the one?’,"""When you have a good partner, actually your life does get better,"" said the Fukrey actor.Richa Chadha and Ali Fazal are a wonderful example of how modern day marriage should look like. Supportive and respectful of each other in good times and bad, the duo have proved on multiple occasions that the bedrock of a healthy relationship starts with a good friendship. But to get to that point, it is necessary to choose the right partner — something most of us struggle with in this complicated era of online dating.

In a recent conversation with content creator Kritika Khurana on her podcast What’s Up Sister?, Chadha opened up about her idea of the right partner, and how to find out the right guy. When Khurana asked her, “How do you know he is the one?”, Chadha revealed, “I think actually when someone is the one, you know. Something in your brain or in your soul is going to tell you that, ‘Okay, this person is the one I want to be with and want to spend my life with’.”The Heeramandi actor posed a question to Khurana, “What happens when you are in a bad relationship?” to which she replied, “It’s really toxic. You can’t focus on your work, your mental health goes for a toss, and your physical health obviously goes for a toss.”

Chadha revealed that a lot of the opposite happens when you are in a good relationship. “When you have a good partner, actually your life does get better. Because when you have a bad partner, your life can just become hell,” she shared.According to Juhi Pandey, psychologist at Mpower Helpline, cultivating and improving friendship with one’s partner promotes a healthy relationship. This can be done by spending quality time with each other, supporting each other personally, socially and professionally, having common shared interests, and expressing and acknowledging the partner’s efforts. “Forgiveness in relationship is very important. Holding grudges not only burdens with the extra emotional baggage but also affects the relationship. Couples should also forgive each other how a good friend forgets and forgives the past differences to solve the conflict and move on in friendship,” she added.","Richa Chadha shared her thoughts on finding the right partner in a podcast with Kritika Khurana, emphasizing that when someone is the ""one,"" you instinctively know. She discussed how a good partner improves life, while a bad relationship negatively impacts mental and physical health.

""I will stay with the NDA,"" he told the media during his Pragati Yatra in Muzaffarpur. Nitish's reaction came days after RJD chief Lalu Prasad offered him a return to the INDIA bloc. Lalu had said, "" Our doors are open for Nitish Kumar. He should also unbolt his gates. This would facilitate the movement of people from both sides.""

Reacting to Lalu's offer, Nitish folded his hands, smiled and curtly responded, ""Kya bol rahe hain (What are you saying?)"" without elaborating further.

Further Nitish said, ""Do baar galti se idhar-udhar chale gaye the--ab kahin nahi jayenge' (We went to here and there twice mistakenly. Now we will not go anywhere),"" he said, clarifying his stand on the issue.

""We are together and continuously taking Bihar forward,” the chief minister remarked while showing his resolve to keep his alliance with BJP intact. During his 'Pragati Yatra' in Gopalganj on Saturday Nitish said,“Development work has been done for the upliftment of all sections. Madrasas have been given government recognition,” he added.

The CM said that earlier, there used to be reports of disputes between Hindus and Muslims, but Bihar's situation changed after the people of Bihar gave them a chance to work. He said that development was taking place everywhere without any discrimination.

Meanwhile, responding to the offer, RJD MP Misa Bharti, the ealdest daughter of Lalu Prasad, remarked that Lalu and Nitish had been old friends. She added that only the RJD president knew what he meant.

RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav has, however, repeatedly said that doors were closed for Nitish and the new year would mark the departure of the NDA government in Bihar.

A political analyst Pramod Kumar said, ""By setting at rest speculations over his switching sides again. Nitish wants to clear any confusion among his core voters particularly women and EBCs as the state is going to the polls in the next 10 months.""

He said the JD(U) president's commitment to stay with NDA came on the day Union Home Minister Amit Shah is likely to visit Bihar.","Bihar CM Nitish Kumar reaffirmed his allegiance to the NDA during his Pragati Yatra, dismissing RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s invitation to rejoin the INDIA bloc.

Carter’s flag-draped casket departed Phoebe Sumter Medical Center in Americus, accompanied by former Secret Service agents serving as pallbearers. The Carter family, including his children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, joined the motorcade as it made its way through Plains, passing the historic train depot that served as Carter’s 1976 campaign headquarters.

Families lined the streets, some carrying flowers and others wearing pins featuring Carter’s photo.

Will Porter Shelbrock, a 12-year-old from Gainesville, Florida, made the trip with his grandmother to pay tribute. “He was ahead of his time,” said Shelbrock, referencing Carter’s humanitarian work and environmental advocacy, including the installation of solar panels on the White House.

The motorcade paused at Carter’s boyhood home, where the National Park Service rang the family farm bell 39 times to honor his presidency. From there, the procession continued to Atlanta for a moment of silence at the Georgia Capitol and a ceremony at the Carter Presidential Center.

Carter’s remains will lie in repose at the Carter Center until Tuesday morning before being transported to Washington, DC, where he will lie in state at the US Capitol.

The state funeral will take place Thursday at 10 a.m. at Washington National Cathedral, a venue that has hosted memorials for many US presidents. Carter’s journey will then come full circle as he is returned to Plains for a private funeral at Maranatha Baptist Church, where he taught Sunday school for decades.

Indian Express ,2025-01-05 00:00:00,"What is LAM, Microsoft’s new AI model designed to perform tasks?","LAMs are seen as a significant step towards achieving AGI, as these models not only respond but also act upon instructions.As we have been observing, large language models (LLMs) are at the forefront of rapid progress in AI as they have been enabling chatbots, text generation, and even code writing. Although LLMs are good at understanding and generating text, they grapple when it comes to performing tasks in real-world environments. Researchers at Microsoft have created what they call a Large Action Model (LAM), an AI model that can operate Windows programs on its own. 

Large Action Models (LAMs) represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, enabling AI systems to execute complex tasks based on human instructions. LAMs mark the shift from AI models that only talk to models that can actually perform tasks.

What are LAM models?
Traditional AI models mainly process and generate text, but LAMs take things a step further. They are capable of turning user requests into real actions. These actions could range from operating software to even controlling robots. It needs to be noted that this concept is not new; LAM is just the first model that has been specifically trained to work with Microsoft Office products. LAMs as a concept gained prominence in the first half of 2024 when Rabbit’s AI device was launched with an AI that could interact with mobile applications without the need of the user. LAM models can understand inputs such as text, voice, or images, and they can also convert these requests into detailed step-by-step plans. They are also able to adjust their approach in real time. In simple words, LAMs are AIs that are designed not just to understand but to act as well. Based on the research paper, Large Action Models: From Inception to Implementation, these models have been designed to interact with both the digital and physical environments. Think of it like, instead of asking an AI how to create a PowerPoint presentation, one could ask an AI to open the app, create slides, and format them according to preferences. At its core, LAMs essentially combine understanding intent, meaning they interpret user commands accurately; action generation, which is the ability to plan actionable steps; and dynamic adaptation, as they are able to adjust based on feedback from their environment. 

How are LAMs built?
When compared with LLMs, the creation of LAM is far more complex as it involves five stages. Data is the foundation of any AI, and LAMs require two types of data: task-plan data, which are high-level steps for tasks such as opening a Word doc and highlighting text. The second type is task-action data, which is essentially specific doable steps. When it comes to training, these models undergo something known as supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and imitation learning. Before they are deployed, these models are tested in controlled environments. They are also integrated into agent systems, such as Windows GUI agents, to interact with other environments. Eventually, the model is tested in live scenarios to gauge its adaptability and performance. The LAMs mark a big leap in evolution—from text generation to action-driven AI agents.

The New Indian Express,2025-01-05 00:00:00,PM Modi sends 'chaadar' to Ajmer Dargah amid fresh controversy,"JAIPUR: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ceremonial ‘chaadar’ was formally offered at the Ajmer Dargah on the occasion of the 813th ‘Urs’ of Sufi saint Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti on Saturday.

Union Minister for Minority Affairs Kiren Rijiju attended the event to present the sacred offering on behalf of the Prime Minister.

At the dargah, Rijiju prayed for peace and harmony in the country. Following the offering, Prime Minister Modi’s message was read out, calling on people of all religions to work together in unity.

In his message, the Prime Minister extended heartfelt greetings to followers of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti worldwide and to the devotees gathered at Ajmer Sharif. He praised the saint’s contributions to humanity, stressing the enduring relevance of his teachings.

“Saints, pirs, faqirs, and great men have illuminated lives with their welfare ideas. Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti’s messages of public welfare and humanity have left an indelible mark. His life and ideals, dedicated to promoting love and harmony in society, will continue to inspire generations,” the Prime Minister wrote.

He further said, “Every sect and every religion should come together and work for the country and for world peace.”
The Prime Minister expressed hope that the Urs celebrations would strengthen mutual bonds among people and inspire efforts for the betterment of society and the nation. Concluding his message, Modi prayed for the happiness and prosperity of the people and bowed to Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti.

As part of the occasion, the Minister also launched a web portal of the dargah, the ‘Garib Nawaz’ app for pilgrims, and an operations manual for the conduct of the annual ‘Urs’. The Sufi saint Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti is also known as Garib Nawaz or the Protector of the Poor.

However, the offering of the chaadar has sparked fresh controversy. Hindu Sena’s national president, Vishnu Gupta, has filed a petition in the Ajmer Civil Court, seeking to prevent Prime Minister Modi from presenting the chaadar. Gupta argued that the act could influence an ongoing legal case concerning the site of the dargah.
In November last year, the Hindu Sena filed a petition alleging that Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti’s dargah was built on the ruins of a Shiva temple. Gupta maintained that the Prime Minister’s participation in the religious ceremony could undermine the court proceedings.

Vijay Sharma, a local lawyer representing Gupta, has submitted an application to the court. Civil Judge Manmohan Chandel has registered the petition and scheduled the next hearing for 24th January. On the same day, the court will also hear arguments regarding the claim that the dargah was constructed on a temple site.

The controversy has added a new dimension to debates surrounding the historic dargah and its significance.","PM Narendra Modi’s ceremonial *chaadar* was offered at Ajmer Dargah during the 813th Urs of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti, emphasizing peace and unity. However, Hindu Sena filed a court petition to halt the offering, citing ongoing legal disputes over the dargah’s origins, claiming it was built on a Shiva temple's ruins.",Politics,50,445
The New Indian Express,2025-01-05 00:00:00,"In a first, 6 Indian Americans take oath as members of US’ House of Representatives","Six Indian-Americans were sworn in for the first time as members of the US House of Representatives on Saturday, January 4. These six individuals won the recent elections for the United States House of Representatives.

This milestone marks a historic moment for the Indian-American community, the largest so far for this minority ethnic community in the United States. Together, they form the informal ‘Samosa Caucus.’ The term, coined by Raja Krishnamoorthi, refers to the group of Indian-origin members in Congress.

The caucus now includes six representatives, expanding from its previous membership of five: Ami Bera, Raja Krishnamoorthi, Ro Khanna, Pramila Jayapal, Jeremy Cooney, and Shri Thanedar.

All six Indian-American lawmakers are Democrats and voted for House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries in the House Speakership election.

Ami Bera, the most senior of the group, was sworn in for the seventh consecutive term as the representative of California’s 7th Congressional District.

“When I was first sworn in twelve years ago, I was the sole Indian-American Member of Congress and only the third in US history. Now, our coalition is six-strong! I am excited to welcome even more Indian-Americans to the halls of Congress in the years to come!” Congressman Dr Ami Bera wrote on X, posting a picture of all six Indian-Americans from the House floor.

Suhash Subramaniam is the newest Indian-American to join the US House of Representatives, representing Virginia’s 10th Congressional District.

“First day of work! Honoured to be sworn into the #119th Congress, and excited to get to work to deliver results for VA10,” Subramaniam said in a post on X, alongside a picture with his family and House Speaker Mike Johnson.

“First day of work! Honoured to be sworn into the #119th Congress, and excited to get to work to deliver results for VA10,” Subramaniam said in a post on X, alongside a picture with his family and House Speaker Mike Johnson.

Pramila Jayapal
Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, representing Washington state’s 7th Congressional District, is the first-ever Indian-American woman elected to the House of Representatives. She is a prominent leader within a powerful progressive group of lawmakers.

Shri Thanedar
Congressman Shri Thanedar, representing Michigan’s 13th Congressional District, posted a selfie from the House floor on X, saying, “Ready to serve.”

Ro Khanna
Ro Khanna, representing California’s 17th Congressional District, is recognised for his influential roles on various House committees.

Raja Krishnamoorthi
Raja Krishnamoorthi, representing Illinois’ 8th Congressional District, serves as the Ranking Member of the powerful China Committee and is a member of the House Intelligence Committee.

Notably, Khanna, Krishnamoorthi, and Jayapal have all taken the oath for a fifth consecutive term.

Several Indian Americans aspiring to be elected to the House faced defeat either in the primaries or in the general elections on November 5. Among them were at least three women: Sushila Jaipal, Bhavani Patel, and Krystal Kaul.

Dalip Singh Saund was the first Indian American to be elected to the US House of Representatives in 1957. He was also the first Sikh elected to the position and served for three consecutive terms as a member of the Democratic Party. It took nearly five decades before a second Indian American entered the US House.

Bobby Jindal represented Louisiana’s 1st Congressional District from 2005 to 2008. He later became the two-term Governor of Louisiana, making history as the first Indian American governor of a US state. Jindal remains the only Indian American to have been elected to the House on a Republican ticket.","On January 4, six Indian-Americans were sworn into the US House of Representatives, marking a historic milestone for the community.

The New Indian Express,2025-01-05 00:00:00,"Germany’s Scholz staying ‘cool’ over Musk’s ‘erratic comments’, worries support for AfD","German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said recent attacks from Elon Musk on him and some of the country’s other leading politicians don’t affect him or the nation’s democracy. However, he expressed concern over the US billionaire’s involvement in a general election through his endorsement of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.

“As Social Democrats, we have been used to the fact since the century before last that there are rich media entrepreneurs who don’t appreciate social democratic politics — and don’t keep their opinions to themselves,” Scholz told Stern magazine.

“It’s nothing new when it comes down to it. You have to stay cool,” he added.

Musk, a close ally of US President-elect Donald Trump, labelled the chancellor a “fool” following the collapse of his coalition government in November. He further stirred a controversy by subsequently endorsing the AfD in an opinion piece published in a major German newspaper, Welt am Sonntag, prompting the resignation of the paper’s opinion editor, Eva Marie Kogel, in protest.

“The Alternative for Germany (AfD) is the last spark of hope for this country,” Musk wrote in his translated commentary. He justified his remarks by citing his investments in Germany as grounds for expressing opinions on the nation’s affairs.

“I find Musk’s support for the AfD far more concerning than his insults,” Scholz said, adding, “especially as the party harbours elements of right-wing extremism, advocates closer ties with Putin’s Russia, and seeks to undermine transatlantic relations.”

Germany’s domestic intelligence service monitors the AfD on suspicion of Right-wing extremism, and the party has already been classified as such in certain federal states.

The early parliamentary election, scheduled for February 23, follows the collapse of Scholz’s three-party coalition in November over disagreements on how to revive Germany’s stagnant economy.

Despite strong polling, AfD candidate Alice Weidel is unlikely to become chancellor, as other parties have categorically ruled out cooperating with the far-right party.

","German Chancellor Olaf Scholz dismissed recent attacks from Elon Musk, stating they don’t impact him or Germany’s democracy, but expressed concern over Musk endorsing the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Scholz noted that wealthy media entrepreneurs have often opposed social democratic politics, and emphasized the need to stay calm. Musk, who called Scholz a “fool” after his coalition’s collapse in November, further stirred controversy by supporting the AfD, citing his German investments. Scholz found Musk’s endorsement troubling, highlighting the AfD’s ties to right-wing extremism and its pro-Putin stance. The AfD is under surveillance by Germany's intelligence service.

The New Indian Express,2025-01-05 00:00:00,"Snow, freezing rain forecast to hit US in biggest winter storm in over a decade","A major winter storm that has the potential to bring the heaviest snowfall and coldest temperature in the United States in over a decade began on Saturday in Central US and was forecast to move east in the upcoming days.

According to the National Weather Service (NWS), a forecast of major winter storm producing heavy snow, significant ice and frigid temperatures has been predicted in the days to come.

According to a BBC report, forecasters have said that the extreme weather conditions are being caused due to the polar vortex, an area around the Arctic where cold air circulates.

Few parts of the US, including Mississippi and Florida which are not accustomed to extreme cold conditions have been issued warnings of a major winter storm.

Meteorologist Rich Bann of the NWS’s Weather Prediction Center on Saturday said, “The storm is still taking shape. But this thing has multiple hazards from heavy snows in the Plains to significant icing covering roads farther south,” reported Reuters.

According to meteorologists, until Saturday evening, the heavy snowfall could be seen in areas between central Kansas and Indiana and there are high chances of at least 8 inches (20 centimeters).

A report by the Associated Press quoted meteorologists, who said that places that witness high snowfall could experience the highest snow totals in over a decade. The storm will thereafter move towards the Ohio valley and multiple travel disruptions are expected as the storm reaches the Mid-Atlantic states on Sunday.

The NWS, in a warning said “Whiteout conditions will make travel extremely hazardous, with impassable roads and a high risk of motorists becoming stranded.”

Blizzards are also being predicted in parts of the Midwest. Snowy and icy conditions are predicted in cities, including Washington DC, Baltimore and Philadelphia from Sunday onwards.

“This could lead to the coldest January for the U.S. since 2011,” AccuWeather Director of Forecast Operations Dan DePodwin said, as per AP.

The New Indian Express,2025-01-05 00:00:00,Congress prepares to certify Trump’s 2024 presidential victory,"Congress is set to meet on Monday for a joint session to certify Donald Trump’s return to the presidency after his decisive victory in the 2024 election, reported AP. The session, a constitutionally required formality, is the final step in officially affirming the president-elect after the Electoral College vote in December.

Vice President Kamala Harris will preside over the session, a ceremonial role that underscores her own defeat.

This year’s certification comes in stark contrast to the events of January 6, 2021, when a violent mob stormed the Capitol in an attempt to overturn Trump’s loss to Joe Biden.

The certification process
During the session, members of Congress will open sealed electoral vote certificates from each state. Bipartisan tellers will read the results aloud, and the votes will be officially tallied.

Harris, as Senate president, will then announce Trump’s victory over her, with a final count of 312 to 226 electoral votes.

The 2022 revision of the Electoral Count Act clarified the vice president’s limited role in the certification process, preventing disputes like those in 2021 when Trump pressured Pence to reject Biden’s win. The updated law also raised the threshold for objections to electoral votes, requiring written support from one-fifth of each chamber, which makes challenges less likely.

If objections meet this threshold, the session would pause, and the House and Senate would separately debate and vote on the issue.

For an objection to succeed, a majority in both chambers must agree—a scenario not expected this year given Trump’s decisive win.

Once the votes are certified, Trump will be inaugurated on January 20 on the Capitol’s west front, reported AP. Harris has publicly conceded and acknowledged Trump’s victory, ensuring Monday’s session is expected to remain routine and free from controversy.
","Congress will convene on Monday for a joint session to certify Donald Trump’s return to the presidency after his victory in the 2024 election.

During the session, Congress will open electoral vote certificates, and the results will be tallied.

Modi inaugurated a 13-kilometre stretch of the Delhi-Meerut Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) corridor from Sahibabad in Uttar Pradesh's Ghaziabad to New Ashok Nagar here and the Janakpuri West-Krishna Park Extension section of the Delhi Metro's Phase IV.

During a press conference, Kejriwal congratulated the people of Delhi and asserted that the projects were a collaboration between the city and the central governments.

Taking a dig at his critics, Kejriwal said, ""These inaugurations are a reply to those who say AAP only engages in fights."" Referring to the challenges faced by his party, he claimed AAP leaders were imprisoned and tortured but maintained their focus on governance.

""Over the past 10 years, our tenure has shown how we kept work above everything else,"" he said.

He also hit out at Modi, alleging that the prime minister devoted the majority of his speech to criticise the Delhi government.

Kejriwal said, ""Today, the prime minister kept abusing the people of Delhi and the elected government of Delhi. I was listening to it, it felt bad. The promise made by the prime minister in 2020 -- the people of Delhi Dehat are still waiting for that to be fulfilled.""

As the Jewish state enters the second year of losing hundreds of her sons, daughters and tiny tots to the dreaded Hamas terrorists, people are yet to come out of the trauma and shock of the October 7, 2023 attack. A group of Hamas terrorists struck at a musical and prayer congregation by the Jewish community as part of Simchat Torah, a religious occasion. More than 1,500 persons including Israeli soldiers were killed while nearly 250 Israeli citizens were kidnapped. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) are struggling to get the hostages released from the custody of the Hamas.

""Our population is still in a state of shock and trauma. Women and children are the worst affected ones and they have not slept well since that fateful day,"" Orli Weitzman, Consul General of Israel, told The Pioneer.

She said the Israeli population's grief has been aggravated by a section of the media that distorts the happenings in her country. As international news agencies report from the frontlines, Israel is trying to gathering support across the world. ""Delegations which include the victims and close relations of persons who lost their lives in the October 7 massacre are calling on countries in Europe, Africa, Asia and America to explain the ground realities,"" said Weitzman.

""The media persons do not check the authenticity of the campaign materials provided by the spokespersons of Hamas and such other organizations,"" said Weitzman.

Dr Joseph John, , a septuagenarian medical doctor in Kerala, believes that the chances of Israel getting justice from international bodies such as United Nations look quite bleak.

Within days after its formation, the SIT of the Crime Investigation Department (CID) took two more accused Sudarshan Ghule and Sudhir Sangle into custody, taking the total number of arrests made in the case to six.

The SIT is looking for the seventh accused Krushna Andhale who is still at large.

Santosh Deshmukh (45), a three-time Sarpanch, was allegedly killed for attempting to thwart the extortion bid on a local windmill company. He was first abducted, brutally tortured and later killed in broad daylight near the windmill company office on the afternoon of December 9, 2024.

The Beed police had earlier arrested four persons -- Vishnu Chate, Jairam Chate, Mahesh Kedar and Pratik Ghule – for the murder of Sarpanch Deshmukh.

Karad, who surrendered before the State CID on Tuesday, is currently in 14 days’ police custody.

Various political parties in the state have also been clamouring for the arrest of Karad in the Sarpanch murder case as well.

The Pioneer,2025-01-05 00:00:00,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2025/india/india-faces-major-heart-stroke-care-accessibility-challenges.html,"Highlighting a significant challenge in stroke care accessibility in India, particularly for ischaemic stroke patients, a study has found that such patients have to travel more than 100 km away from the nearest intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) treatment center and endovascular therapy (EVT) center.

This distance can severely delay crucial treatment. Overall, roughly a fourth of the Indian population has access to a rehabilitation centre within an hour of experiencing an ischaemic stroke -- caused when a blood clot affects supply to the brain, a study has found.

The research, published in the International Journal of Stroke, also estimated that there is less than one ischaemic stroke centre per million population and suggested that establishing stroke facilities equipped with intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular treatments in poorly served regions in India is urgently needed to increase access and improve outcomes for stroke patients.

Ischaemic stroke is the most common, accounting for about 70-80 per cent of all strokes in India, according to a September 2024 study, published in the journal Scientific Reports.

In the recent study, researchers, including those from the US' Ascension Health and All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Hyderabad, found that a total of 566 stroke centres equipped with the 'intravenous thrombolysis' method of treatment (which breaks up blood clots) were spread across 26 states and union territories.

Of the 566, over 60 per cent (361) were found to be also equipped with endovascular therapy for stroke patients, considered superior.

Typically, an ischaemic stroke patient was 115 kilometres away from the nearest intravenous thrombolysis treatment centre and about 130 kilometres away from the nearest endovascular therapy centre, the researchers found.

Further, a little over 26 per cent of the Indian population can access an intravenous thrombolysis centre in under an hour, while about a fifth can access an endovascular therapy centre, the team found.

For the analysis, data on ""intravenous thrombolysis capable (IVT-C) and endovascular treatment capable (EVT-C)"" stroke centres were collected in March 2021 from medical devices and pharmaceutical industry providers. Time taken to drive to the nearest stroke care centre was estimated using the application 'Google Distance Matrix API'.

""Access within one hour to an IVT-C and an EVT-C centre was available to 26.3 per cent and 20.6 per cent of the Indian population, respectively,"" the authors wrote.

""The average stroke centres per million (SCPM) population was 0.41 and 0.26 for IVT-C and EVT-C, respectively,"" they wrote.","A study highlighting the accessibility issues in stroke care in India has revealed that ischaemic stroke patients often have to travel more than 100 km to reach the nearest treatment centers for intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and endovascular therapy (EVT). Ischaemic stroke, the most common type, accounts for 70-80% of all strokes in India. The study found that only about a quarter of the Indian population has access to rehabilitation centers within an hour of suffering a stroke. With fewer than one stroke center per million people, the research suggests that urgent efforts are needed to establish more treatment centers in underserved regions. The findings emphasize the importance of improving access to these critical treatments to improve outcomes for stroke patients. Currently, about 26% of the population can reach an IVT center within an hour, while only 20% have access to an EVT center.",National News,143,401

Following the hundred in the series opener, Kohli's troubles outside the off-stump compounded as he was caught in the slip cordon eight times over the course of five Tests.The tour that got over on Sunday is likely to be Kohli's last. “It's always been a a wonderful contest. More than just the runs that he scored, he brings a bit of theatre to the game which is sometimes good and sometimes it can rile you up as an opposition, which I'm sure is part of his plans,” Cummins said in a response to a PTI query after the six wicket win here.“Really enjoyed playing with him. You know, he’s been one of the the star batters for the last decade or so. You know, if you get his wicket it goes a long way to winning a game so yeah, it will be sad if it’s his last series.” Cummins did admit that Bumrah’s absence on the final day of the series did help them, considering he took 32 wickets in the series. “Every time he (Bumrah) bowled he seemed to have an impact and took some key wickets. So yeah, no doubt that (his absence) helped our chase a little bit.” Although he termed it as Indian team’s internal matter, Cummins was a touch surprised with Rohit Sharma’s decision to drop himself from the playing eleven on account of poor form.“I think you're always surprised when the captain kind of doesn't play. And you know, same with Ashwin retiring, but honestly it doesn't really affect us at all.

“You just turn up and you see who's going to be on the team sheet and you play whoever eleven they put out there. Honestly, it's been very little conversation I've chatted with him about what's going on there,” Cummins said.

He termed the win against India as “huge” in the context of the Indo-Australia bilaterals, having lost twice at home previously.

“No, it's a huge win in the context of this series. It's as big a series as you get to play at home. It felt like it was kind of see-sawing throughout the whole series. So to finish it 3-1 to hold the trophy is an amazing feeling,” Cummins said.

“…… and I think the extra layer is now securing a spot in the World Test Championship Final which was always a huge goal for us in this cycle."" He has been a part of T20 World Cup winning squad, won the 50-over World Cup, World Test Championship mace and Ashes as the skipper and now the India series that his predecessor Tim Paine had lost twice.

When he was asked if he has any succession plan in place, he sidestepped the issue.

“First of all I just absolutely love what I do. So, I mean that's probably the biggest driver in wanting to play Test Cricket and work with this team and support staff.” So does he feel that he has done it all? “Unfortunately, I have got to keep playing. We'll stay on this side guys and then we'll come over here,” he smiled and everyone laughed.","Pat Cummins praised Virat Kohli as a fierce competitor, expressing regret if Kohli's recent series was his last in Australia. He also acknowledged Bumrah's absence as beneficial for Australia’s win and commented on Rohit Sharma's decision to drop himself.

“However, only 5.5 per cent of them are covered under any work-related social insurance scheme — one of the lowest in the country,” it said. Additionally, 46 per cent of the elderly in the state have had no schooling, while only 23.7 per cent have completed secondary schooling or above.

Among elderly women, a huge 82 per cent are economically dependent, either fully or partially, on others, compared to 54 per cent of men, the report said.

The labour participation rate among the elderly in the state is relatively high, with many continuing to work out of financial necessities. However, most of their work occurs in informal sectors and low-paying jobs, making it difficult for them to meet basic needs, it said.

“This economic scenario, characterised by low wages and insecure employment, significantly contributes to the perpetuation of poverty levels among the elderly in Odisha.

However, sources have confirmed that the party has decided to opt out of the race.
Signs of disintegration within the party are becoming evident, starting from the constituency of TMC state chief, Charles Pyngrope. Reports suggest that hundreds of party workers from his constituency are preparing to join the State Congress and are even pressuring Pyngrope to follow suit.
Despite repeated attempts to seek clarity, key TMC leaders, including Meghalaya in-charge Manas Bhuyan, state president Charles Pyngrope, and TMC Parliamentary Party president Mukul Sangma, have remained silent on the matter.
Earlier, Pyngrope admitted that the party lacks a significant vote share in the tribal belts of the Khasi-Jaintia Hills. He also cited a lack of communication from the party’s high command, contributing to the uncertainty surrounding TMC’s participation in the district council polls.

The two accused were identified as Dibil Kumar and Rajesh. They allegedly killed a 24-year-old woman and her 17-day-old twin daughters in Kollam district's Anchal in February 10, 2006.According to reports, Dibil Kumar and Rajesh were former Armymen. Dibil was a native of Anchal, while, Rajesh hailed from Kannur. Both of them served in the army and later were declared as deserters, reports claimed.

The two were produced before a court in Kochi on Saturday and were remanded in judicial custody, according to a prosecutor, news agency PTI reported.

What's the case about?
In February 2006, bodies of Ranjini, a 24-year-old mother, and her 17-day-old twin daughters, were found at their rented home in Anchal, a small village in Kollam. Their throats were slit.The dispute was reportedly over the paternity of the twin daughters.Sources told PTI that Ranjini and Dibil Kumar were having an affair. She later got pregnant. After the twins were born on January 24, 2006, Dibil began distancing himself from her.

According to Mathrubhumi, Ranjini had reportedly demanded that Dibil Kumar accept responsibility as the father of the twins. When Kumar refused, tensions escalated, and Ranjini took legal steps.

Ranjini had filed a complaint with the Kerala State Women's Commission against Dibil Kumar regarding the paternity of the babies and sought protection. The Commission issued a directive to subject Divil Kumar to a DNA test, Onmanorama reported.However, before the test was conducted, Ranjini and her babies were found murdered in their rented house when her mother had gone to the panchayat office.Probe revealed that Dibil Kumar had allegedly killed Ranjini with the help of his friend Rajesh. After the crime, the two men fled, seemingly disappearing without a trace. They were absconding for 18 years.

Both Kerala police and the CBI had identified the accused during earlier investigations. However, the duo managed to evade arrest until now. In 2008, the CBI took over the case following a plea from the victim's family.It was revealed that after committing the murder, Dibil Kumar changed his name and identity. He kept himself a new name – Vishnu, a CBI spokesperson said in a statement.

Rajesh also changed his name to Praveen Kumar, concealed his real identity and got married in Puducherry, the CBI spokesperson said.They had managed to evade by changing their names, securing Aadhaar cards under their new identities, and avoiding any association with their past crimes. They had started new lives under false identities in Puducherry.Breakthrough: How a photo helped solve triple murder mystery
After hitting several roadblocks, a breakthrough in the case occurred after 18 years. An anonymous tip reached the CBI's Chennai unit that the long-elusive suspects came under the investigation again.

Meanwhile, an old photo taken at a wedding was said to be the crucial lead in the probe. According to Onmanorama, the investigation team had sourced a photo of Dibil Kumar taken at a wedding he had attended.

""The technical intelligence wing made use of image metadata employing reverse search, aided by AI tools and found matches on social media. This was used to trace the present address and the information was handed over to the CBI,"" Manoj Abraham, ADGP (Law & Order), was quoted by Onmanorama as saying.Accused arrested
Acting on intelligence and after a thorough verification, a team of CBI officers traced the two in Puducherry and nabbed them on Friday, the CBI statement said.

""The CBI investigation revealed that the above murders were committed by Dibil Kumar, and his friend Rajesh. Both the accused were absconding from the stage of investigation in 2006,"" the statement said.

The CBI found out that Dibil Kumar had impersonated and changed his name to Vishnu while Rajesh assumed the identity of Praveen Kumar. T

The CBI had filed a chargesheet and the court had declared them as Proclaimed Offenders, the statement read.","A 19-year-old triple murder mystery was solved by the CBI, leading to the arrest of two former Army personnel, Dibil Kumar and Rajesh, who murdered a 24-year-old woman and her 17-day-old twin daughters in Anchal, Kollam, in February 2006.

Indian Express,2025-01-05 00:00:00,How Jasprit Bumrah’s absence turned final day of the Test and series into an anticlimax,"Jasprit Bumrah stood near the stumps on a pitch adjacent to the main pitch. It was in the morning, much before the start of day 3 at the SCG that turned out to be the final day of the match and the series. The question that hung overnight was if Bumrah would be fit to bowl. Pat Cummins would later say that “every time he bowled he seemed to have an impact and took some key wickets. So yeah, no doubt that helped our chase”.

By evening there was a sense of flatness even in the large sections of Australian fans in the stands near the dressing rooms, muttering about an “anti-climatic’ end. But in the morning, there was still hope among Indian fans when they spotted Bumrah near the pitch.

On the other side, quite a few of the Australian squad were present, many of whom had their necks craned on the Indian side. Bumrah threw one look at them, walked up to the stumps and went through imaginary bowling drills—walking to the stumps, and releasing. But all eyes were fixated on the Indian dressing room when the innings was wrapped up quickly by Cummins and Boland who ended up with a six-for and his first first-class ten-wicket haul (10 for 71).One by one, the Indians filed out but there was no sign of Bumrah. Those Indians already in the arena got together for the huddle, when someone ran out of the dressing room to join them. It was KL Rahul, and not Bumrah. And that was it; day’s and the series’ fate was decided. “Disappointing, probably missed out on the spiciest wicket of the series,” Bumrah said later.Horror start
If there was any doubt, the first over by Mohammad Siraj had a five wides down the leg side, and a smashed four as 13 runs were leaked. Prasidh Krishna matched Siraj in the amount of runs, with three wides, he gave in the next. As many as 35 runs had flooded in three overs before Sam Konstas top-edged a slog to get out in the next over. Marnus Labuschagne guided a short wide ball to gully before Prasidh Krishna bounced at an advancing Steve Smith to force an ugly fend to gully. Smith had just one more to get to his 10,000th Test run, but that now has to wait until he reaches Galle in Sri Lanka later this month.

That triple strike by Krishna had left Australia on 58 for 3 in 10 overs but Travis Head, India’s tormentor not only this series but also in the past, and Usman Khawaja, making hay while sun shines in the absence of his series-tormentor Bumrah, put the issue beyond much doubt with a 46-run partnership in 8.1 overs with a flurry of boundaries.

Though Khawaja did fall for 41, edging a pull through to Rishabh Pant off Siraj, the 31-year old Test debutant Beau Webster stayed unbeaten with Head to seal the series triumph. Webster charged out to Washington Sundar, who bowled just one over in this game on a grassy pitch, to biff the winning runs over mid-off. Cummins rushed out of the dressing room to celebrate with his other team-mates gathered there. In the middle, Webster and Head screamed in joy. “Been a crazy five Tests, the guys that got through all five are probably looking forward to some time off,” Head would say. His partner Webster put the day’s mood succinctly: “I was counting down the runs, was pretty confident the whole chase.”A series that has created a few headaches for both teams, but Australia, under the leadership of Cummins and Andrew McDonald the coach, can be expected to address it. Just as they brought in Konstas as opener and dropped Mitch Marsh for Webster. It remains to be seen how Indians handle it.

Question of future
Some of the issues in both teams are similar: the declining form of their ageing batsmen, be it Khawaja or Rohit or Kohli. Some of the positives too are the same: fresh talent doing decently well, and the bowlers sparkling.

With the new WTC cycle coming up soon, what will India do? A new-ish team or …? And though Rohit might have said otherwise, and it’s his prerogative as player to decide to continue playing on, it will come down to Ajit Agarkar-led selection committee with the support of the board to take a call. Do they want Kohli to be with them for some part of the WTC cycle, in hope that he will regain form? And what sort of approach do they really want from their coach Gautam Gambhir? Will they think about having two different coaches for white-ball and Test cricket?In the end, just before the presentation ceremony, Gambhir was milling in the teem of people out there, sought out Kohli and gave him a pat on the back. Rohit hung around with a few of his team-mates before Rohit and Kohli headed back and walked up the steps. It could well perhaps be the last time they both head together into an Indian Test dressing room – certainly in Australia. In case the two star players don’t take the call, it’s up to the selectors and the board to decide if it’s the last time anywhere in the world.","India's series against Australia ended with a flat finish, as Bumrah didn't bowl due to injury. Despite early breakthroughs, Australia's partnership between Head and Khawaja secured their victory. With aging stars like Kohli and Rohit, India's future involves selecting fresh talent and possibly reconsidering coaching roles for the WTC cycle.",Politics,50,884

The seizures were made during regular checking drives conducted on New Year’s Eve. The seized items included various mammalian species, rodents, birds and reptiles. However, no arrest could be made in this connection.

The DFO said that stopping illegal hunting and selling of wild meat is posing a great challenge due to its increasing demand among the rich and influential people. He said that the people are indulging in wildlife hunting due to the increasing demand. “Further, wild meat is sold at very high prices, which is encouraging the poor people to indulge in such illegal activities,” he said.

The DFO said that the divisional forest office, in association with Kamle forest division, the Upper Subansiri district administration and local students’union organised a series of awareness programmes in Daporijo to educate the people about the importance of wildlife conservation.

 “But hunting and trading of wild meat is going on unabated in the markets of Daporijo,” Pao lamented.

He appealed to the community leaders of Upper Subansiri district to come forward and work for the protection of wild resources.

The DFO said also that they are facing difficulty in effectively tackling illegal wildlife hunting activities in their area due to shortage of human resource and vehicles.","On 4 January, forest officials from Daporijo in Upper Subansiri district seized large quantities of wild animal carcasses and wild meat during regular checking drives on New Year's Eve.

Mint ,2025-01-05 00:00:00,"TRAI crackdown on spam: New rules, DLT pilot, and consumer protection focus in coming weeks","Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) is likely to introduce new norms as a move towards cracking down on spam, DLT pilot, amongst other things, reported the news agency PTI.New Delhi, Jan 5 (PTI) TRAI will start, this month, a pilot to onboard paper-based and past permissions given by customers for receiving commercial communications onto its digital distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform, a process that in the long-run would include scrubbing and verifying their current validity and offering opt-outs to those keen on it, Chairman Anil Kumar Lahoti said, adding that tighter regulations on curbing spam as well as new consultation examining an authorisation framework for telemarketers can also be expected in coming weeks. Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has also ruled out any rethink on its latest regulation that mandates service providers to offer separate special tariff vouchers (STV) for voice calls and SMS.Lahoti told PTI in an interview that while consumers can be encouraged to use data, they cannot be ""compelled"" to do so.TRAI's focus is to protect not only the interest of the industry, but also the interest of the consumer, who must have the option to pay only for services they need, he said.

The regulator is also all set to initiate a massive rehaul of its IT system, a move, it expects, would lead to rationalisation and reduction in multiple instances of filings by telecom companies and other industry stakeholders. Deloitte which has been roped in as a consultant is on the verge of submitting its report on revamp of its IT systems. The regulator will thereafter appoint an agency for the revamp and the entire exercise will be prioritised and completed this year, Lahoti said.

On TRAI's list of priorities for 2025 are recommendations on satellite communications spectrum -- arguably one of the most keenly watched events in a high-stakes game involving telcos like Jio, and Airtel on one side and Elon Musk's Starlink pitted on the other.Lahoti declined to comment on the specifics or timeline for release of the recommendation except to say ""all comments are being examined on their merits and we will take a balanced view"".

TRAI's 2025 to-do list also includes framing recommendations for network authorisation, new authorisation framework for broadcasting, and revamp of national numbering plan for fixed line, while work will continue on combating and curbing spam calls and pesky messages. TRAI is in the process of operationalising system of separate 160 series for service or transactional calls by principal entities (say banks, insurance companies or other service providers) to differentiate them from promotional calls. Currently, both types of calls are being routed under 140 series, which will henceforth be used only for promotional calls. Lahoti said the regulator will firm up its recommendations on millimetre wave spectrum band (auction of spectrum in 37-37.5 GHz, 37.5-40 GHz and 42.5-43.5 GHz bands) in about a month's time and also bring out a consultation paper on backhaul spectrum by March this year.

""Another thing which we will be working on is the digital consent acquisition. Although the provision for this exists in the regulation (TCCCPR), the practical constraint has been the legacy consents... because there are volumes of consent which have been acquired on paper or reside in the past systems of principal entities, the challenges has been about how to take those consents onboard to the DLT, because you cannot completely discard them,"" Lahoti said.

TRAI plans to work with all stakeholders to find a workable solution, to ensure such onboarding and scrubbing does not cause any disruptions.

""Presently, if you receive message or a call from a particular service provider or seller and you complain that this is spam, they are able to say that no, we have the consent of this particular subscriber on paper. Still, this is not on record, on the system, but with the principal entities. So we want to move to a system where all these consents come on the DLT platform,"" he said.

""The problem is how to onboard the consents which are already there and how to provide the consumer an option that if he/she has not given that consent, they should be allowed to exit,"" he said, adding TRAI's pilot, which starts in January, will rope in select service providers and principal entities to devise and test a mechanism by which the past consents, can be migrated onto DLT.

There should be a cut-off date beyond which legacy and paper-based consents would no longer be valid but that is a massive time-consuming exercise, he said. TRAI will also bring-out new, tighter regulation for spam control in a month, he said referring to August discussion paper on 'Review of the Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations, 2018' where the regulator among other issues had sought stakeholder view on whether a higher tariff should be introduced for calls and SMS-es beyond a certain limit in a graded manner.

The regulator in the consultation paper mooted that telecom subscribers making over 50 calls or sending out even 50 SMS a day, along with certain other markers, should be scrutinised as a potential pesky callers.

About recent reports of Department of Telecom (DoT) seeking clarity from TRAI on telcos' bank guarantee encashment to recover fines against violation of regulatory provisions related to anti-spam norms, Lahoti said, ""after the DoT asked this question to us, we already identified the particular licence clauses which were violated, and informed the DOT that these are licence conditions which were violated, and now they have to take action, including the amount of financial disincentives which is outstanding against them.""

On the industry pushback on the voice-only STVs, Lahoti said that the regulator has to take a balanced view after taking all aspects into consideration.

""We have to take a balanced view, after taking the interest of both sides into consideration....You cannot compel the consumer to buy data, unless they want to. You can encourage them to buy data, not force them to buy data...Do your marketing, education, we are not stopping you...But you can't say I will not give you an option,"" he said.","TRAI will launch a pilot in January to onboard past consents for commercial communications onto its digital ledger. The regulator plans tighter spam control regulations and IT system revamp. It will also address spectrum, network authorization, and broadcasting frameworks.

Christian Stocker is a lawyer and a member of Austrian Parliament; he has also served as general secretary of the People's Party since 2022.

Christian Stocker was declared interim leader after Karl Nehammer announced Saturday that he would resign in the next few days after coalition talks with the Social Democrats collapsed.

Nehammer is expected to meet with Austria's President Alexander Van der Bellen on Sunday. The president will then make a public statement to announce the next steps.

Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said Saturday he will resign in the coming days after talks on forming a new government failed a second time.The announcement came after the People's Party and the Social Democrats on Saturday continued coalition talks a day after the liberal Neos party's surprise withdrawal from discussions.

“Unfortunately I have to tell you today that the negotiations have ended and will not be continued by the People's Party,” said Nehammer.

He stated that ""destructive forces"" within the Social Democratic Party have ""gained the upper hand,"" and emphasized that the People's Party will not endorse a program it deems harmful to economic competitiveness.

Speaking on the coalition talks, social democratic leader Andreas Babler said he regretted the People's Party decision to end the talks. “This is not a good decision for our country,” he said. Babler said that one of the main stumbling blocks had to do with how to repair the “record deficit” left by the previous government.“I have offered to Karl Nehammer and the People's Party to continue negotiating and called on them not to give up,"" he told reporters Saturday evening.

The next government in Austria faces the challenge of having to save between 18 to 24 billion euros, according to the EU Commission. In addition, Austria has been in a recession for the past two years, is experiencing rising unemployment, and its budget deficit is currently at 3.7 per cent of Gross Domestic Product — above the EU's limit of 3 per cent.

Seven-year-old Tinotenda Pudu wandered 23 kilometres (14 miles) away from his home and unknowingly entered the dangerous Matusadonha Game Park, shared Zimbabwean MP Mutsa Murombedzi on social media. “This is a true miracle,” she said in a statement.

The boy became lost near the Hogwe River, an area filled with lions and elephants, and managed to survive by sleeping on a rocky perch and eating wild fruits.

Local Nyaminyami community members played drums daily in hopes of guiding him back home, but park rangers from Matusadona Africa Parks ultimately rescued him, reported NBC News.
In an official statement, Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks) said the boy, identified as seven years old, had walked 49 kilometres (30 miles) through the harsh terrain of the park. NBC News noted that heavy rain complicated the search efforts by washing away his footprints.
On 30 December, rangers discovered fresh tracks in the Sakata Valley of Matusadona National Park and located Tinotenda the next day. “The boy was immediately taken to a local clinic and later to a hospital for further medical evaluation,” NBC News reported, citing ZimParks.

Mutsa Murombedzi provided an update on the boy’s condition, saying he had rested and was stable but would undergo mental health evaluations to ensure no lasting trauma.
“Above all, we thank God for watching over Tinotenda and leading him back home safely,” she said, according to NBC News. She added, “This is a testament to the power of unity, hope, prayer, and never giving up.”

The Pioneer,2025-01-05 00:00:00,World Bank to approve USD 20 bn lending package for Pakistan: Report,"The World Bank is set to approve a USD 20 billion indicative lending package for Pakistan – a pioneering 10-year initiative to protect its funded projects from political transitions and focus on six targeted areas, according to a media report.

The programme, titled ""Pakistan Country Partnership Framework 2025-35"", aims to improve social indicators in the most neglected but important areas, The Express Tribune newspaper reported, citing official documents.

It will focus on reducing child stunting, combating learning poverty, enhancing climate resilience, decarbonising the environment, expanding fiscal space, and boosting private investment to improve productivity.

These areas have broad support across the political spectrum and are expected to remain unaffected by government changes during the 2025-2035 period, which is anticipated to include at least three general elections.

This 'Country Partnership Framework' is scheduled to be approved by the World Bank board on January 14, following which the global lender's Vice President for South Asia Martin Raiser is also expected to visit Islamabad.

According to the World Bank's assessment, the planning framework ""will help shield the programme from the country's volatile polity and frequent swings in priorities and requests that follow government changes.""

The requests arising from government changes have caused 'fragmentation of the World Bank portfolio and diluted impacts,' it said.

A key Pakistani official, who was part of the framework development, said that the World Bank picked Pakistan as the first country where it would introduce the 10-year partnership strategy.

""The World Bank's total indicative lending envelope for fiscal year 2025 to 2035 will total around USD 20 billion,"" reads a draft of the framework.

Out of the USD 20 billion, the World Bank's concessional arm, the International Development Association (IDA), will lend USD 14 billion and the remaining USD 6 billion is projected to be provided through the relatively expensive window - the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD).

""However, these indicative loans will depend upon the evolution of the IDA funding over the years, Pakistan's standing and performance, including with respect to the Sustainable Development Finance Policy and its debt vulnerability indicators,"" reads the document.

In addition to the USD 20 billion loans to the government of Pakistan, the new framework also aims to support another USD 20 billion private lending by the World Bank's two other arms - the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). This brings the total package to USD 40 billion but the official loans will be equal to USD 20 billion, according to the newspaper.

The new lending will focus on six areas that ""currently enjoy strong support across the Pakistani political spectrum"", according to the documents. However, it will phase out lending from 10 less-impactful sectors, such as transport, power transmission, telecoms, tertiary healthcare and higher education.

The World Bank's concessional and expensive lending will be meant for ""larger projects on average, more frequent scale-ups and expansions, and less pilots and one-off operations"", according to the planning document.

The Washington-based Bank's new strategy marks a shift from ""short-term macro-fiscal adjustment programmes and often small investments scattered in a wide array of sectors, to more selective, stable and larger investments in areas that are critical for sustained development and growth"".

The documents stated that the World Bank would still be supporting reforms to spur growth and investment and build more fiscal space.

The implementation of the 10-year framework will be supported by two-year rolling business plans that both sides will agree upon, according to the paper.","The World Bank is poised to approve a groundbreaking USD 20 billion lending package for Pakistan under the ""Pakistan Country Partnership Framework 2025-35."" This long-term, 10-year initiative is designed to safeguard projects from political instability, focusing on six key areas: reducing child stunting, combating learning poverty, improving climate resilience, decarbonizing the environment, expanding fiscal space, and boosting private investment for productivity. These sectors enjoy broad political support and are expected to remain unaffected by government changes, ensuring consistency throughout the period, which will include multiple elections.

The package will consist of concessional loans from the International Development Association (IDA) totaling USD 14 billion, while the remaining USD 6 billion will be provided through the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). Additionally, the World Bank's private lending arms, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), will contribute another USD 20 billion in private sector loans, bringing the total value to USD 40 billion.

This shift in strategy marks a move away from smaller, scattered investments to more substantial, targeted initiatives aimed at fostering long-term growth and stability. The framework will be finalized after approval on January 14, and the World Bank's Vice President for South Asia, Martin Raiser, is expected to visit Islamabad shortly afterward.",Business and Finance,210,579
The Pioneer,2025-01-05 00:00:00,Data protection rules balance regulation & innovation while safeguarding citizens' rights: Vaishnaw,"The draft data protection rules released by the government create a balance between regulation and innovation while protecting citizen rights, Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Saturday.

The government issued draft rules for the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act on Friday for public consultation till February 18.

""Rules have to be within four walls of the Act. It is within the ambit of the Act passed by Parliament. These rules have been framed to ensure a balance between regulation and innovation while completely safeguarding the rights of citizens,"" Vaishnaw told PTI in an interview.

The minister said earlier there was only one template available to the world -- the European data protection rule with a high level of regulation. However, Indian rules have attempted to balance the regulation with innovation to safeguard the boom in the innovation ecosystem developing among startups in the country.

He said extensive consultations have been held with the industry and systems such as complaint registration, their handling and distribution, interaction with digital platforms, have been put in place.

The minister said the final rules will be placed before Parliament in the monsoon session for approval and all entities handling data digitally will get two years to calibrate their systems as per the law.

""All the entities covered under the Act will have to review existing consent within two years after the rules are in place,"" Vaishnaw said.

He said the rules will be improvised based on the experience of the new data regime.

""As far as possible, minimum prescription has been kept in the rules to ensure simple implementation of the Act. The rules have carefully addressed the large harm that the digital world poses to the privacy of people, especially children,"" Vaishnaw said.

The DPDP draft rules specify that a parent's verifiable consent will have to be obtained by social media or online platforms before children can create any account.

Further, parents' identity and age will also have to be validated and verified through voluntarily provided identity proof ""issued by an entity entrusted by law or the government"", as per the draft rules.

""We have also kept graded punishments to protect the interests of micro, small and medium enterprises. It is to save businesses who may be running their business using a single computer. However, Big Techs have higher obligations under the rules. Minor breaches will attract small penalties and big breaches will lead to higher penalties,"" Vaishnaw said.

He said the penal provision will be implemented as per the Act and the rules prescribe the way to implement them.

The Act has the provision to impose penalty of up to Rs 250 crore on data fiduciaries.

""There is a provision on voluntary undertaking under the Act where an entity can voluntarily disclose any breach to authorities and the Data Protection Board (DPB) will deal with it as per Act,"" Vaishnaw said.

As per the DPDP Act, the acceptance of the voluntary undertaking by the Board will protect an entity from proceedings under the provisions of this Act. However, the protection will be subject to the approval of the DPB.

If a person fails to adhere to any term of the voluntary undertaking accepted by the DPB, it shall be deemed a breach of the provisions of the Act and the board after giving an opportunity of being heard to the person may proceed to act as per the penal provisions.

The minister said utmost precaution has been taken to protect small businesses as per the basic principle laid down in the Act.

Vaishnaw said the rules for data processing overseas will be implemented while keeping in mind citizen rights and national interests.

""The country should be able to take benefit of all the new opportunities that are emerging out of the digital economy,"" Vaishnaw said.

The rules will not have an impact on existing rules under which news media operate, he said, adding, ""Media rights will continue to remain as it is. Press will continue to function as per the current framework.""

Digital platforms will also have to be informed and they will need to take consent of people in English or official languages as mentioned in the Constitution, Vaishnaw added.","Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw stated that the draft rules for the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act aim to balance regulation with innovation, ensuring citizen rights are protected while fostering the growth of startups. The government released these draft rules for public consultation until February 18. Vaishnaw emphasized that the rules are in line with the Act passed by Parliament and are designed to safeguard privacy, particularly for children. For example, platforms will need verifiable parental consent before children can create accounts.

The rules include graded penalties, with micro, small, and medium enterprises facing lighter penalties for minor breaches, while larger companies like Big Tech will face stricter consequences. The penalties could be as high as Rs 250 crore for severe breaches. There is also a provision for entities to voluntarily disclose breaches, which, if accepted by the Data Protection Board, could shield them from further legal action.

The final rules are set to be presented to Parliament during the monsoon session, and businesses will have two years to adapt to the new regulations. Vaishnaw assured that the rules would consider national interests and citizen rights, especially for data processing overseas, and that the media's rights would remain unaffected.",Business and Finance,199,699
The Pioneer,2025-01-05 00:00:00,ICAI seeks tax benefits to promote climate change mitigation strategies,"Chartered accountants’ apex body ICAI has sought tax benefits for promoting climate change mitigation strategies and a separate section for income from shares and securities in the income tax returns form.

Besides, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) has sought a special tax regime for partnership firms and limited liability partnerships (LLPs) as well as simplification of income tax return forms.

The institute on Friday said it has advocated for prudent tax reforms aimed at fostering economic growth and encouraging environmental sustainability in the pre-Budget Memorandum 2025.

“Provision of tax benefits for promoting climate change mitigation strategies, which will not only contribute to India’s climate change goals but also drive economic growth by promoting sustainable business practices is a suggestion in this direction,” it said in a release.

Among other suggestions, ICAI has proposed a new head to show income from shares and securities that will have provisions relating to taxability of income by way of dividend, interest or capital gains.

Rationalising conditions for treating a return of income as defective in the e-filing regime and provision of opportunity of being heard before treating a defective return as invalid is another suggestion by the institute.

ICAI has also pitched for simplifying the capital gains provisions under sections 54 to 54F of the Act, extending 10 per cent tolerance band to cases where value is determined by the valuation officer under Section 50C(2), rationalising rate of tax under Section 115BBE in respect of cash credits and unexplained investments.

Further, the institute has proposed obtaining report of a chartered accountant in the prescribed form certifying the sum chargeable to tax instead of going through the process of getting the certificate of lower deduction of tax from the assessing officer, where a non-resident transfers immovable property to a resident.

As per the release, another recommendation is to exempt the transferee responsible for paying to a non-resident transferor from the requirement of obtaining TAN.

Meanwhile, ICAI has submitted its final recommendations regarding simplifying the I-T Act, including introduction of special tax regime for partnership firms/LLPs, simplification of the registration and taxation regime of charitable trusts as well as provisions for determining residential status of individuals.

Other suggestions include simplification of income tax return forms, alignment of TDS/TCS rates with the objective of serving as an audit trail, periodic review of disposal of cases by assessing officer, mandatory time limit for disposal of appeals, and effective grievance redressal mechanism.

Another recommendation is the extension of time limit for filing belated return to March 31 of the assessment year.","The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) has proposed several tax reforms in its pre-Budget Memorandum for 2025. These include offering tax benefits for promoting climate change mitigation strategies to support India’s environmental goals and economic growth.

The institute suggested a special tax regime for partnership firms and LLPs, as well as a more straightforward income tax return process. It also proposed simplifying the process for non-residents transferring immovable property to residents. Other recommendations include a more efficient grievance redressal system, alignment of tax deduction rates, and a mandatory time limit for appeal disposal.

HMPV is a viral pathogen that causes respiratory infections in people of all age groups. First discovered in 2001, it belongs to the Paramyxoviridae family and is closely related to the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). HMPV spreads through respiratory droplets from coughing or sneezing, as well as by touching contaminated surfaces or coming into direct contact with infected individuals.

This virus is known to cause illnesses ranging from mild respiratory discomfort to severe complications, especially in vulnerable populations such as infants, older adults, and individuals with weakened immune systems. It reportedly tends to peak during late winter and early spring in temperate regions, although it circulates year-round in some areas.

The Union Health Ministry emphasised that HMPV is already in circulation globally, including in India, and cases of respiratory illnesses associated with it have been reported in various countries.

Symptoms
The symptoms of HMPV vary depending on the individual’s age, general health, and immune response. Mild cases typically present with a runny nose, sore throat, cough, and fever, resembling a common cold. Moderate symptoms may include persistent cough, wheezing, and fatigue.","Two cases of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) reported in Karnataka have raised public concern.

The next few frames show Aaman’s failed attempt at riding Azaad. With frustration, he complains, “Iska daru, khana, paani sab dekh rahe hai, par yeh humein baithne bhi nahi deta hai (I have been his caretaker but he never lets me ride him).”

The dialogue follows with a dialogue by Ajay Devgn, “Rishwat se toh insaan kabu mein aate hai… ghoda paseene mein bahaduri aur wafa ke mehak se (Bribery can control people, horses are controlled with pride and loyalty).”

The trailer then shows Britishers wanting to send Indian labourers to South Africa, with villagers pleading to stop the torture. How Aaman gets to ride Azaad and free his village is to be uncovered in the film releasing on January 17.

Apart from Raveena Tandon’s daughter Rasha, Aaman and Ajay Devgn, the film also stars actor Diana Penty, Mohit Malik and Piyush Mishra in important roles. Azaad, directed by the maker of Rock On, Kai Po Che, and Kedarnath, Abhishek Kapoor, is co-produced by the director as well as Ronnie Screwvala and Pragya Kapoor.

Indian Express,2025-01-06 00:00:00,"‘John Abraham would feed us, not eat anything himself’: Rohit Roy recalls when he would work out to look ‘bigger than John’","Rohit Roy and John Abraham worked together for the film Mumbai Saga. It was a film directed by filmmaker-producer Sanjay Gupta, who happens to be a close friend of Rohit. In a recent interview, Rohit shared several memories of him with the Dhoom actor. He also shared how he got gym on set to look bigger than John Abraham in the film.

Speaking with Cyrus on his podcast, Rohit Roy said, “When I am shooting, about 12-14 hours of my time is gone there. For times like these, I have a gym in my van all the time. I have it from the time of Swabhiman. It is a regular van, but I have turned one side of it into makeup room and the other side of it is my gym. It is not a full-fledged gym, but it has things that I would need to work out.”
He added, “My last film was with John Abraham, Mumbai Saga. He would not bring the gym on set, he has got a gym at his house so he would make sure to work out and still be on time on set and I used to work out on set because I wanted to look bigger than him in the film. I didn’t want anybody to say that he has got a part in the film because he is friends with Sanjay Gupta.”

He then revealed, “What John told Gupta after we were done shooting is that, ‘I would never say this, but yeh picture toh Rohit ke triceps par chalne wali hai.’ That was quiet a backhanded compliment. He is very funny. You cannot figure out whether he is being serious or joking. He and me would often discuss bikes. He is very smart and witty.”

Their film, however, didn’t do well and most of its scenes including Rohit Roy was never shot due to COVID-19 pandemic.

Recalling another incident from the film sets, Rohit said, “We were shooting for Mumbai Saga. Gupts (Sanjay Gupta) also loves food. There was this another actor, Shaad Randhawa, who owns the restaurant Bayroute. Outstanding food. At this point in time, we were shooting in South Mumbai. So he would say, ‘I have brought food from Bayroute ya, let’s eat.’ Shaad would put a spread, obviously, if John Abraham is called for lunch then… it was all kebabs, hummus, excellent food.”

But John wouldn’t eat a thing. He said, “John wouldn’t eat a single thing and he would make us eat the whole thing. The first day, I noticed he didn’t eat anything… he did the same on second day. Then I realised, he is calling us for food, feeding us but not eating anything himself. Then he would say, ‘Don’t worry yaar, don’t feel guilty, you have eaten all this food, tomorrow don’t eat carbs.” That was a serious advise.”

Sharing another common thing that he shared with the Housefull actor, Rohit shared, “I have six bikes. That’s another thing I had in common with John. We used to love talking about bikes and I also clean my bike myself.”

Rohit shared he is the owner of two Indians, FTR 1200. “Indian is the first motor bike company in the world.” He also shared he owns a Triumph Rocket. “I have my dream bike, the Java Bobber. I had to buy that and I love it. And I also have an electric bike called the ultra violet EV, which goes from 100 to 160 in under 7 seconds. I never do that.”","In a recent interview, Rohit Roy shared anecdotes from his time working with John Abraham on *Mumbai Saga*. He revealed how he would bring a gym to the set to ensure he looked bigger than John, who preferred working out at home. Despite their friendly rivalry, John jokingly told director Sanjay Gupta that *Mumbai Saga* was ""driven by Rohit's triceps."" Rohit also recounted how John would invite the crew to eat lavish meals but never ate himself, advising them to skip carbs the next day.

Indian Express,2025-01-06 00:00:00,Lyricist Anantha Sriram criticises Prabhas’ Kalki 2898 AD for ‘portraying Karna as superior to Arjuna’: ‘Ashamed to be part of this industry’,"Director Nag Ashwin’s epic mythological sci-fi actioner Kalki 2898 AD was one of the biggest hits of 2024 in India, ranking as the second-highest-grossing Indian film of the year. Starring Prabhas, Deepika Padukone, Amitabh Bachchan, Kamal Haasan and Disha Patani, the film fused elements of the Hindu epic Mahabharata with fiction, crafting a distinctive narrative set across multiple eras. While Amitabh Bachchan portrayed Ashwatthama, a warrior from the epic, Prabhas took on dual roles, as Bhairava, a bounty hunter, and Karna, a loyal ally of Duryodhana, the eldest Kaurava.

Now, lyricist-poet Anantha Sriram has come forward criticising the film for its depiction of Karna, claiming it portrayed him as superior to Arjuna. Speaking at a public function organised by Vishwa Hindu Parishad in Andhra Pradesh’s Krishna district last week, Sriram, Hindustan Times reported, alleged that contemporary cinema was “distorting Hindu mythology” and called for a boycott of such films.
Also Read | Alia Bhatt’s professionalism is ‘shocking’; Salman Khan would workout till 3am, says Ram Kapoor: ‘If you’re not like that, then get out’

Alleging that filmmakers were misrepresenting Hindu deities and symbols, Sriram also claimed that he once pledged not to collaborate with a director who rejected the usage “Brahmanda Nayakudu” (a reference to Lord Vishnu) in one of the works he had written. “When they distorted and portrayed Karna as superior to Arjuna, how dare we as a Hindu society stay silent? When Draupadi vastraharan (disrobement) took place, what did Karna do? I am ashamed as a person who belongs to this film industry. We are not going to stay silent anymore,” HT quoted him as saying.

In response, filmmaker Venu Udugula, known for helming movies such as Needi Naadi Oke Katha (2018) and Virata Parvam (2022), pointed out that the humanisation of Karna in Telugu cinema dates back to 1977 with NT Rama Rao’s Daana Veera Soora Karna and questioned whether Sriram’s criticism extended to NTR’s portrayal of Karna. “The matter of Kalki movie aside, in the Telugu cultural narrative, the first film to introduce a social and humanitarian perspective to Karna’s character was Daana Veera Soora Karna. The great NTR brought Karna’s persona closer to the people through this film. Are your comments directed solely at Karna’s character, or do they also attempt to undermine the socially resonant vision that NTR presented? Can your remarks be seen as a rejection of his creative legacy?”","Lyricist Anantha Sriram criticized the film *Kalki 2898 AD* for portraying Karna as superior to Arjuna, claiming it distorts Hindu mythology. He expressed his dissatisfaction with the misrepresentation of Hindu deities in contemporary cinema and called for a boycott.

Indian Express,2025-01-06 00:00:00,"Diljit Dosanjh could have been at the Oscars, only if Amar Singh Chamkila actually got its due","It was exactly two years ago when the euphoria of ‘Naatu Naatu’ had consumed the West. It almost felt like a scene out of RRR where foreigners were asking each other ‘What’s Naatu?’ yet, dancing to it like they were at a single screen theatre in Hyderabad. The music became bigger than the film and Indian cinema, which proudly boasts about its song and dance culture, had its moment on the global stage. Now, in 2025, India can have its moment again with Payal Kapadia’s All We Imagine As Light. But, while the audience and so-called cinema experts were debating if Laapataa Ladies was the right choice for the Oscars, no one really discussed if Diljit Dosanjh-starrer Amar Singh Chamkila had the potential to be the film that represents India, and this was perhaps a missed opportunity.

The excitement of watching ‘Naatu Naatu’ on the Oscar stage was enough for us to get up at an ungodly hour so imagine the anticipation if Diljit were to perform there. 2024 was undoubtedly the year of Diljit Dosanjh on a global scale. His moment in the international arena started with Coachella in 2023 and continued with his Dilluminati tour in 2024. He sold over 7 lakh tickets around the world and resellers in North America even sold his show’s ticket at a staggering Rs 54 lakh. His shows in India saw people spending abundant money to watch him live in action, and most of them had an unforgettable experience. Diljit knows how to hypnotise a stadium full of fans so they cheer for him, and with him, but he also knows how to sprinkle some magic when he is on screen and that’s what he did with Amar Singh Chamkila.



Diljit’s performance in Amar Singh Chamkila was one of the most mesmerising movie-watching experiences of 2024. And if one were to package this film for an international audience, it had everything going for it. The story of a real-life musician from rural India who survived casteism, riots and communal tension, and managed to achieve the status of Punjab’s Elvis Presley only to be shot by unknown assailants at the age of 27. The story presented by Imtiaz Ali was unlike any conventional biopics that we have seen in mainstream movies and the musical style of the film took it a notch higher than a regular song and dance film. It was the kind of desi experience that shows the culture of India but doesn’t brush the uncomfortable truths under the carpet. The volatile era of the 1980s, the social injustice, and even the hypocrisy of the society; everything finds a place in this musical.

Amar Singh Chamkila was a Netflix product, which means that the film could have had international representation by a company that is known for its deep pockets, and has a history of pushing non-English content onto the global platforms. A month after this film’s release, Netflix tried to push Heeramandi as the next big thing from India as they hosted its premiere in Los Angeles. A couple of months after the film’s release, Diljit was touring in the US, where he also performed on Jimmy Fallon’s late-night show, which was another historic moment for an Indian artiste. While he was there for his tour, one wonders why Netflix did not seize the opportunity to build him up as a global triple threat who can actually sell packed stadiums. Moreover, they also had AR Rahman on board for this film, who has previously won an Oscar, so they could have positioned it as an Indian musical experience.

It is somewhat shocking that Amar Singh Chamkila wasn’t even on the list of 29 films submitted to the Film Federation of India which finally selects the Indian submission for Oscars. This was the pool that had films like Animal, Kalki 2898 AD and even Chota Bheem And The Curse Of Damyaan, but Amar Singh Chamkila was missing here. Of course, one of the criteria for eligibility for Academy Awards is that the film must have a theatrical release for a week, which wasn’t the case here; but the makers could have made it happen if they positioned the film as a contender for Oscars. If, like Payal Kapadia’s film, this was snubbed by the FFI, they could have still been in the competition independently.

In an interview with Film Companion, while promoting Amar Singh Chamkila, Diljit came across as a humble artiste who surrenders himself to his director and doesn’t have an explanation for his process. He implied that he couldn’t write a thesis explaining his preparation for the role, but he could perform with utmost sincerity. He also said that he doesn’t see himself as an actor, but as a musician, and this was perhaps something that pushed him to play Chamkila in a way that it doesn’t even feel like one is watching a performance.

Diljit, and his fans, had a wonderful 2024 and if he was the artiste who was on the Oscars stage representing India, it would have been a cherry on the cake. Perhaps, that’s next on his list!","In 2024, Diljit Dosanjh's *Amar Singh Chamkila* captivated audiences with its portrayal of the real-life musician who overcame casteism and social unrest in rural India. The film, blending music and social commentary, had the potential to represent India at the Oscars, especially with Netflix's backing and AR Rahman involved. Despite its global appeal and Diljit's massive international presence, the film was notably absent from India's Oscar submission list, raising questions about missed opportunities for broader recognition.",Entertainment,76,932

While the actress is upset over her eviction, she also comes with a lot of anger, especially towards Avinash Mishra and Karanveer Mehra. In an exclusive interview with SCREEN, Kashish slammed the Bigg Boss contestants as well as makers. She also declared that what many labelled as misbehavior with host Salman Khan was not wrong, according to her.

Talking about her altercation with Salman Khan and why she apologized to him, Kashish said, “I felt bad after behaving like that with him, the guilt was eating me. Even that day when I was talking I realized that I was being defensive, but it was not because I was being disrespectful but because I was put in a spot. I do understand that a lot of people don’t like it when somebody defends themselves as aggressively as I did. I was not wrong. I felt bad that I spoke to Salman sir like that, he is very senior to me and my body language even though was not wrong, wasn’t liked by him. I respected that sentiment and apologized.”

Agreeing with the popular opinion about Avinash Mishra being toxic, Kashish went on to slam the actor and said, “He is toxic, I knew it from the moment I entered. The way Avinash gets aggressive, he will flip and start saying derogatory things. He argues in a crass manner and has no class. He is very insecure and has a big ego too.”

Recently, it has been mentioned several times that both Vivian Dsena and Karanveer Mehra are leading as audience favorites. It was also said that the two have the potential to be the final contenders for the trophy. When Kashish was asked if they were strong, she said, “Not at all. When a failed product is marketed brilliantly, and you have spent a lot of money on it, everybody talks about the product. When Karanveer was marketed to me I thought he was a sensible guy, but in the house when I met him, I learned that he is far from good.”

Kashish also commented on Chahatt’s affair being discussed on national television, and said that she didn’t expect this from the makers. “Chahatt’s secret relationship is nobody’s concern, it happened outside the show and doesn’t involve any member of the show. I don’t think it was justified, not something I expected would happen on Bigg Boss,” Kashish opined.

Now as the show is in its final leg, Kashish wants to see Rajat Dalal in the top 2, sand deserves to win. Bigg Boss 18’s grand finale is scheduled to happen on 19th January.

The New Indian Express,2025-01-06 00:00:00,Delhi sees record surge in voter registration amid cash schemes for women,"NEW DELHI: The Chief Electoral Office (CEO) in Delhi on Monday reported an 'unprecedented' surge in voter registration forms, with over 5 lakh submissions in the past 20 days.

It is equivalent to the total forms typically received in an entire year. 

CEO officials attributed the spike to the Aam Aadmi Party's Mukhya Mantri Mahila Samman Yojna (MMMSY) which promises Rs 2,100 monthly assistance to registered women voters.

The scheme has garnered significant public attention ever since it was announced by the party recently.

The officials said that they expect the trend to continue as the Congress unveiled a similar scheme earlier in the day while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is also expected to come out with a Direct Bank Transfer (DBT) scheme. 

Congress on Monday announced 'Pyari Didi Yojana', promising monthly financial assistance of Rs 2,500 to women if voted to power in Delhi.

The announcement was made by Karnataka's Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar, who highlighted the success of similar initiatives in Karnataka. 

The announcement of the 'Pyaari Didi Yojana' by Congress comes as a direct counter to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP's) Mukhya Mantri Mahila Samman Yojna (MMMSY).

While both AAP and Congress' schemes promise financial assistance for women, the latter has positioned its own initiative as a more robust and immediate solution.

Shivakumar emphasised that the scheme is designed to empower women financially, a vision that has already shown positive results in Karnataka.

""We are confident that the Congress will form the next government in Delhi, and as soon as we take office, the first Cabinet meeting will implement this scheme,"" he said.

Drawing parallels with the Karnataka model, Shivakumar shared that the Congress government there had brought significant financial relief to families, with savings of Rs 4,000 to Rs 5,000 per month through similar initiatives.

He expressed confidence that such reforms would bring about similar transformations in Delhi, benefiting the city's residents.

The 'Pyaari Didi Yojana' is set to be a cornerstone of Congress's women empowerment agenda, with Delhi Congress chief Devender Yadav promising more such initiatives in the near future. 

Yadav assured the people of Delhi that the party’s approach would be grounded in action, drawing from its successful implementation of similar schemes in states like Karnataka, Telangana, Himachal Pradesh, and Rajasthan.

""Under this scheme, Rs 2,500 will be credited directly to the accounts of Delhi's women every month, benefiting half of the city's population,"" reiterated Yadav.
The voter registration spree began on December 16 with the poll body receiving 5.1 lakh Form-6 applications since that date. Election officers have been directed to prioritize the scrutiny of all such forms submitted in the past one month.

""This trend of unprecedented increase of form-6 and that too after 20 days of last date of receiving claims and objections is unexpected and needs greater scrutiny,"" the Delhi's poll body stated.

“This volume, typically seen over a year, has been logged in just three weeks. The timing coincides with the announcement of DBT schemes. There is a possibility of forged documents being used to secure benefits,"" a senior official said.

""We are conducting 100 per cent field verification to identify eligible applicants. Stringent actions are being taken against those submitting fake documents for voter registration,"" he added.

Till now, the poll body has lodged eight FIRs against 24 people for submission of false documents to obtain voter ID cards. ","The Delhi CEO reported an unprecedented surge in voter registrations, with over 5 lakh forms submitted in 20 days, linked to political parties' financial schemes. AAP's Mukhya Mantri Mahila Samman Yojna and Congress's Pyaari Didi Yojana are driving the spike. The election body is verifying the applications to prevent fraud.",Politics,50,563
Indian Express,2025-01-06 00:00:00,Upasana Konidela shares daughter Klin Kaara’s reaction as she sees dad Ram Charan on screen for the first time. Watch,"Following the massive failure of Acharya (2022), Telugu star Ram Charan is all set to make a grand comeback with director S Shankar’s Game Changer. Interestingly, this political action thriller marks Charan’s first movie in a lead role since he and his wife Upasana Kamineni Konidela were blessed with a baby girl, Klin Kaara Konidela, in 2023. While his admirers are excited for his big return, it seems that Charan’s fandom has now gained a new, little member who gets just as excited seeing him on screen as his ardent fans do.

Taking to social media recently, Upasana shared a heartwarming video showing baby Klin Kaara reacting to seeing her father on television for the first time. In the clip, Klin can be seen catching a glimpse of the new Netflix documentary RRR: Behind and Beyond, which offers a behind-the-scenes look at director SS Rajamouli’s epic film (2022) featuring NTR and Ram Charan. When Klin spots her naana (father) on the screen, she reacts with joy, yelling and waving affectionately. In her post, Upasana wrote, “RRR was truly an experience of a lifetime for us in countless ways. Watching her naana for the first time on TV.”
Check out video of Klin Kaara watching her father Ram Charan on screen for the first time here:
Also starring Kiara Advani, Anjali, Samuthirakani, SJ Suryah, Srikanth and Sunil in key roles, Game Changer is Shankar’s first Telugu directorial. Besides Charan, the film’s success is crucial for Shankar as well, since his previous directorial endeavour the Kamal Haasan-starrer Indian 2 (2024), had bombed at the box office. Game Changer is set to hit the screens on January 10.

Despite riding the high of RRR’s global success and sharing the screen with his father, Telugu megastar Chiranjeevi, Ram Charan couldn’t ensure the success of Acharya and it performed very poorly at the box office, earning just Rs 73.5 crore globally against an estimated budget of Rs 140 crore, according to industry tracker Sacnilk. Directed by Koratala Siva, Acharya also featured Pooja Hegde, Sonu Sood and Jisshu Sengupta in key roles.","After the disappointing performance of *Acharya* (2022), Ram Charan is making a highly anticipated comeback with the political action thriller *Game Changer*, directed by S.

He used to work on about ten projects at the same time, many times making producers wait. He was known for his tardiness, but his stardom was such that his tantrums were always entertained. His dance acumen, acting skills, comic timings are what made him a bankable star of the era. Once when the actor was shooting in Hyderabad, Aamir Khan rushed to witness him act on set. This incident was fondly recalled by Govinda’s co-star Shakti Kapoor during the promotions of Rangeela Babu about five years ago.

Speaking to Bollywood Bubble, Shakti Kapoor shared, “I remember an incident from older days. Govinda and I were shooting for a qawwali scene on stage in Hyderabad. It was a face-off between the both of us. From a distance, I saw someone very short standing in a corner in the crowd. When I looked at him, I felt like I have seen this person somewhere. After a while, I realised it was Aamir Khan.”
He added, “I asked him, ‘Sir, what are you doing here? Someone bring him a chair and tea.’ He said, ‘I have come to see how Govinda manages to lip sync so well and how he manages to give such long shots in one take.’ He then said, ‘I am the biggest fan of Govinda.'”

Earlier, he would arrive at 9 pm for a 9 am shift. Now, he arrives at 8:30 am for a 9 a.m. shift.” He added, “Insecurity aadmi ko kaha se kaha pahucha deti hai. (Insecurity changes people). Now he is very professional and entire industry knows it.”

In the same interview, Shakti Kapoor also rooted for his old friend and co-star. He said, “People say now its too late for the actor to make a comeback, I don’t believe it. We have seen people like Amrish Puri starting at 44. Its never too late for an actor or artiste.”

Aamir Khan has often shared his admiration for Govinda. Back in 2010, in an interview with PTI, the Laal Singh Chadha actor shared, “My favourite actor is Govinda. He can really make me laugh. I just love his films. ” He added, “Govinda is one actor who really entertains me. He has got a great comic timing and he is a fine actor.” Sharing his favourite picture of the actor, Aamir said, “I have seen his film Sandwich some 10 to 12 times.”

The Shark Tank promo video begins with Vineeta Singh, CEO and co-founder of SUGAR Cosmetics, asking her fellow sharks who the next contestant is, to which Kunal Bahl, co-founder of Snapdeal, responds, “It’s Flying Beast, the influencer.” Surprised, Singh asks, “Gaurav Taneja?! He’s coming?” After Bahl nods in confirmation, the teaser cuts to Taneja entering the stage with a wide smile. “Sharks, these days all founders want to become influencers. Don’t know where they get the urge from,” he says, prompting Vineeta Singh to quip, “And influencers want to become founders!”

Introducing Beast Life, Taneja explains that it is not just a health and supplement brand, but a “healthy way of life.” During the pitch, a person from the company, accompanying Taneja, claims that Beast Life generated Rs 1 crore in sales within just one hour of launching, which stuns the sharks. “That is a dream for a lot of businesses,” Aman Gupta, co-founder and Chief Marketing Officer of electronics brand boAt Lifestyle, points out. Concluding his pitch, Taneja can be seen asking the sharks “Rs 1 crore for 1 per cent of equity.”

Bahl, curious about Taneja’s background, asks, “Generally, IIT-ians go to Google, Facebook etc or go for start-ups. How come your trajectory is different?” As Gupta points out, “These days a lot of influencers are floating brands,” Peyush Bansal, co-founder and CEO of Lenskart, asks, “What is the kind of income an influencer can generate today?” “You earned Rs 1 crore in 1 hour, then what are you doing here asking for Rs 1 crore (for 1 per cent equity),” asks Singh. In response to the questions posed by the sharks, Taneja says, “Just like the ‘Beast’ in the name ‘Beast Life’, my everything is in this. If this fails, I can’t create another one (brand). This is my life.” The promo video concludes on a cliffhanger, leaving viewers wondering if Flying Beast will secure a deal with the sharks.","The teaser for *Shark Tank India* Season 4 reveals an exciting pitch from influencer-entrepreneur Gaurav Taneja, aka Flying Beast, who introduces his fitness brand, Beast Life.

In an unfortunate incident, two youths lost their lives in a road accident while returning home after attending the event in Rajahmundry (officially Rajamahendravaram), Andhra Pradesh, on Saturday. The event was also attended by Charan and Arjun’s uncle, Andhra Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister and actor “Power Star” Pawan Kalyan.

The victims, identified as Arava Manikantha (23) and Thokada Charan (22), were travelling on a bike when a van collided head-on with their vehicle near Vadisaleru at around 9.30 pm on Saturday, India Today reported. Although they were rushed to Peddapuram Hospital, both succumbed to their injuries. The young men were residents of Kakinada district.

Meanwhile, on Monday, Deputy CM Pawan Kalyan announced an ex gratia of Rs 5 lakh to each bereaved family. In a statement released to the media, he expressed his grief over the incident and also criticised the previous state government for neglecting critical infrastructure, specifically the ADB Road, a key route connecting Kakinada and Rajamahendravaram.

“It is deeply saddening to learn about this incident. The deceased, Mr Arava Manikantha and Mr Thokada Charan from Gaigolupadu in Kakinada district were returning home on a two-wheeler on Saturday night. Unfortunately, a speeding vehicle collided with their bike, resulting in their untimely death. I extend my heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families of Mr Manikantha and Mr Charan,” Kalyan said in the official release to the media, news agency PTI reported.

“On behalf of the Jana Sena Party, we will provide financial assistance of Rs 5 lakh to each of the bereaved families. I have also instructed my office officials to ensure that the government extends adequate support to the families,” he noted.

Kalyan also addressed the road’s condition, stating, “The ADB road is a crucial route for travel between Kakinada and Rajamahendravaram. The previous government neglected the expansion and reconstruction of this road, failing to even carry out basic maintenance work. The coalition government (headed by Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu) has initiated repair and reconstruction works on the ADB road. However, this tragic incident during the repair phase is deeply distressing. It is especially heartbreaking to note that the deceased were returning home from the Game Changer pre-release event when the accident occurred. Ironically, the event had emphasized road safety, urging attendees multiple times to travel safely.”

It became quite big when the actress in turn released a three-page long statement, accusing him of holding a grudge against the couple. Now, after nearly two months, the actress has been slapped with yet another legal notice. This time from the makers of Chandramuki, according to Gulte.

The actress, who marked her acting debut in 2003 with the Malayalam film Manassinakkare, went on to make Vismayathumbathu, and Natturajavu. In 2005, she made her first Tamil film Ayya, followed by Chandramukhi. The film starred actors Rajinikanth and Jyotika. As the documentary, Nayanthara: Beyond The Fairy Tale, explores the actor’s career and love life, it included clips from several of her films from the beginning to her comeback to the latest Jawan.
Now, according to Gulte, the makers of Chandramukhi have sent a legal notice, demanding Rs 5 crore for using a few second clips from the 2005 film.

Previously, after sharing a statement against Dhanush, the actress had shared another list thanking the people who supported her and cleared NOCs to use clips from their movies. The list along with names like Shah Rukh Khan, and Chiranjeevi, also included the name of her Chandramukhi producer Ramkumar Ganesan, who produced the film under his banner Sivaji Productions. The actress is yet to react to the legal notice.

In November last year, Dhanush sent a legal notice to the actress soon after she released the trailer of her documentary. The legal notice demanded Rs 10 crore for using a three-second BTS clip of the actress and her husband Vignesh Shivan.

Nayanthara slammed the actor for his legal notice and wrote in her statement, “I am in receipt of your legal notice and we shall respond to it befittingly through lawful means. Your refusal to give NOC for use of elements of Naanum Rowdy Dhaan for our Netflix documentary might be justified by you to the courts from copyright angle but I wish to remind you that there is a moral side to it, which has to be defended in the court of God.”

Indian Express,2025-01-06 00:00:00,Nouran Aly recalls meeting Vivian Dsena during his divorce battle with Vahbiz Dorabzee: ‘She must have gone through a lot too’,"Much like his memorable performances in beloved television soap operas such as Pyaar Kii Ye Ek Kahani, Madhubala – Ek Ishq Ek Junoon and Shakti – Astitva Ke Ehsaas Ki, actor Vivian Dsena has also captured hearts as one of the most loved contestants on Bigg Boss 18 and with the show approaching its grand finale, Dsena’s popularity has soared to remarkable levels. In a heartwarming moment, his wife, Egyptian journalist Nouran Aly, recently visited the Bigg Boss 18 house to meet him, sparking a wave of emotion.

Aly also opened up in a new interview about how they first met, fell in love and eventually built a life together. She spoke about Dsena’s first marriage with actor-model Vahbiz Dorabzee as well, and about her own family too. Recalling their first interaction, Aly revealed it began over WhatsApp when she was trying to arrange an interview with him. This led to phone conversations and, eventually, an in-person meeting.

“He was shooting Shakti at that time, but in my country (Egypt), Madhubala was making a lot of news and was being dubbed in Arabic and shown on one of the biggest channels. So, this channel was supposed to have him over for a meet-and-greet event. As part of this, we were supposed to produce interviews. I sent his then management a message and though they replied, it took a lot of time. Then the event got cancelled due to some issues,” she shared during a chat with Galatta India.

Aly added, “So the interview was pending for my magazine and I kept following it up for three months. After that, I messaged him that ‘people are saying you are an egoistic person and it has come out to be true. It is not good for your fans and when someone respects you for your work, you are supposed to respect them back.’ Then he messaged back saying that he isn’t like that, urging me to understand that he has a very busy schedule. He also assured me that I would get my interview in 24-48 hours and I did. Then I got to know it was like a challenge he had, ‘Who got the guts to talk to me like that?'”

During the conversation, Aly revealed that Dsena was the first to confess his feelings, just a month after they met in person — six months after their aforementioned interview. “He said, ‘I like you a lot and would like to take this ahead, but I have a situation.’ His divorce case was still going on. ‘I cannot commit or promise anything official. But I commit that I really like you and want to take this ahead if you stay with me and have the patience.'”

Discussing Dsena’s divorce, Aly expressed empathy for both parties, acknowledging the emotional toll it must have taken. She said, “Anyone who has been in a relationship for long, emotionally and psychologically involved, it will affect both sides. Vivian doesn’t talk, but I’m really sure that he had gone through a low phase. The other person too… I am not taking this away from her… must have, as a woman, gone through a lot. No divorce is happy; it takes a toll on both sides. If she (Dsena’s first wife) says she had gone through something mentally or psychologically, it is her total right. Society doesn’t spare you if you are a divorced woman.”

Aly also spoke about her own past and how Dsena embraced her family wholeheartedly. “I too am a divorcee. I have two girls, Laila and Alia, who are ten and eight. They study in Bahrain. My family also consists of my father, mother, three sisters and a brother. Vivian helped a lot in filling the gap (emotionally since she had come out of a broken relationship) and healing the part that he was not responsible for. He understood my mindset, where I was coming from and my situation. He accepted my daughters and treated them more than his own. That gives you a lot of security and comfort and helps you trust again,” she added.

","Vivian Dsena's wife, Egyptian journalist Nouran Aly, recently shared the story of how they met and built their relationship. They initially connected over WhatsApp when Aly was trying to arrange an interview with him. After some delays, their interaction grew into a deep connection, with Dsena admitting his feelings for her despite going through a divorce. Aly, a divorcee herself with two daughters, praised Dsena for embracing her family and helping her heal emotionally.

Indian Express,2025-01-06 00:00:00,"Scam 1992 actor Paresh Ganatra recalls losing all his savings during Harshad Mehta market crash: ‘My salary was Rs 5,000 in those days’","Paresh Ganatra is known for his comic roles in hit films like Welcome, No Entry, and Scam 1992, among others. The actor, who was last seen in Zakir Khan’s TV show, is known for his iconic dialogues and unique sense of humour. In a recent interview with Digital Commentary on their Youtube channel, Paresh recalled his casting for the role in Anees Bazmee’s Welcome (2007) and how he insisted on working in Scam 1992 The Harshad Mehta Story after losing all his saving during the market crash in 1992.

Recalling what inspired him to work in the Hansal Mehta show, the actor recalled, “I was working then and my salary was Rs 5,000 per month. I had Rs 75,000 in savings and it was a big amount at that time. I lost it all during Harshad Mehta scam. When I found out about Scam 1992, I insisted that I would play this role despite Hansal Mehta saying it was a small role. It was based on RK Damani who is the owner of D Mart and my personal story made me decide that I would definitely play it.”



During the conversation, the actor recalled the time when he got a call from director Anees Bazmee for the role in Welcome. “I had already worked with Anees in No Entry. When Welcome was being shot, my show Baa Bahoo Aur Baby was airing on Star Plus. Anees bhai called and said that there’s an interesting character in the film for you and you will have to come to Dubai on so and so dates for 15 days,” he shared.

Paresh further added, “I told him that my show is going on and I shoot it for 25-27 days in a month. It will be difficult for me, I can’t do it. He tried to convince me but I apologised and said that I won’t be able to do it because this is my prior commitment.”

However, Anees tried to get him on board again after some time, but this time, for a day’s shoot. “After 6 months, he called me again and asked me to come for a one day shoot to Lonavala to shoot just one climax scene and you can’t say no. I just asked him about the dates and went to the shoot at Tiger Point in Lonavala.”

The Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 director is known to give freedom to his actors for improvisation and that’s what happened on the sets of Welcome. “He narrated the climax scene to me and wanted to improvise it. I had thought of a line, which is so iconic now, ‘Mai sirf dikhne mai khatarnaak hu, lekin aadmi bahut acha hu’. I suggested and he agreed to use it for my character,” Paresh elaborated.

In fact, veteran actor Nana Patekar also partook in the final output of the scene. “By then, Nana sir came and asked to start the shoot. When we narrated the whole scene to him, he came up with another improvisation. ‘Mujhe kyun toda, mai illegal nahi tha’. Anees bhai was so happy. Vo scene dhaancha tha and kahan pahuch gaya (It was merely a rough draft and went to another level). As an actor, he gives a lot of freedom to improvise, that’s something really good about him, you don’t get that in many directors,” he ended.","Paresh Ganatra, known for his comedic roles in films like *Welcome* and *No Entry*, shared insights into his career in a recent interview.

Indian Express,2025-01-06 00:00:00,"‘Entire theatre clapped when Sanjay Kapoor slapped Madhuri Dixit in Raja,’ recalls Indra Kumar: ‘I thought my career was over when his first film flopped’","Sanjay Kapoor marked his acting debut in 1995 with the film Prem. However, the film, also starring Tabu, failed at the box office. Although his next movie, Raja, was scheduled for release three weeks later, due to the poor performance of his debut film, many believed his career was over even before it started. Raja director Indra Kumar believed that his career as a filmmaker too was over, now that his film was going to flop due to Sanjay Kapoor. However, it turned out to be a huge success.

Recalling the incident, Indra Kumar, who had delivered two successful films before Raja, told Siddharth Kannan, “After giving two successful films, I reshot Raja. When I watched the original film, I quiet didn’t understand certain scenes. I realised my mistake, so I rewrote the script and shot it again. That picture too went on to become a super hit.”

He also added that things were not as smooth as they sound now. He shared, “Just three weeks before the release of Raja, another film of Sanjay Kapoor with Tabu (Prem) had released. But it flopped. People started making fun of me. Even I lost hope. In my mind, I thought, ‘Indra Kumar, consider this your last film. After this, let’s go to Haridwar.'” Explaining his state of mind, Indra Kumar who had just directed the third film of his career, shared, “Now my hero was Sanjay Kapoor, whose previous film flopped so everybody was talking about him. It could have had a bad impact on my film. I lost hope. But, thanks to my stars, and Madhuri Dixit, and Saroj Khan, and my writers, they all saved this film for me.”

Sharing his success moment, the filmmaker said, “When I was watching the movie in Novelty (theatre), the same people who were ridiculing Sanjay Kapoor for his previous film, were clapping for him on the scene where he slaps Madhuri Dixit.” The filmmaker smiled as he shared the incident. He proudly explained, “There is a scene where Madhuri Dixit accuses Sanjay Kapoor’s brother of harassing her, but he slaps her instead and takes his brother’s side. He refuses to believe her. The entire Novelty theatre was clapping. That’s how much power the script holds.”

The line that Indra Kumar was referring to in his quote was: “Khabardaar jo mere bhai ko pagal kaha aur rahi baat faisle ki toh sun, tujh jaisi 1000 ladkiyan mai qurbaan karta hu apne bhai pe. Samjhi? (Beware anyone who calls my brother mad, and as far as the decision is concerned, listen, I will sacrifice 1000 girls like you for my brother. Understood?)”

Indra Kumar was also a new filmmaker back then who marked his debut with the 1990 film Dil, followed by the 1992 film Beta. Both the films turned out to be commercial hits.

In the same interview, he talked about Sanjay Kapoor not becoming a successful actor. He shared, “Although the film was a great success, it didn’t work in favour of Sanjay Kapoor. I say this to my son too, ‘It doesn’t matter how good you are as an actor, it all depends on your fate and stars. There is a reason certain actors are termed stars. It is because their stars favour them and make them successful. Sanjay Kapoor’s stars were not as powerful. According to me, he did great in movies like Raja. But, it didn’t work for him.”

Sanjay Kapoor got into supporting roles within a decade of his acting career as most of his films flopped at the box office. Eventually, he turned towards production, followed by OTT shows and movies. He reunited with his Raja co-star Madhuri Dixit for the Netflix show, The Fame Game.","Sanjay Kapoor's career took a major turn after his debut film *Prem* flopped, leaving doubts about his future. However, his second film, *Raja*, directed by Indra Kumar, became a huge success despite initial fears of its failure due to Kapoor's previous setback.

Despite the success of *Raja*, Kapoor's career didn't flourish as expected, with Kumar attributing his lack of long-term success to fate and stars, not talent.

Taking to social media on Sunday, the actor explained that her decision to speak out stemmed from repeated potshot-like queries from people asking whether her silence meant she enjoyed such remarks or agreed with them. Rose also noted that the said person’s sexually coloured remarks against her constituted prima facie criminal offences.

“The said person, as if taking revenge for my refusal to go to the events he invited me to, shows up at other functions I attend and makes derogatory mentions of my name in the media whenever possible. If you ask me whether one can insult any woman using the arrogance of wealth and the legal framework in India provides no protection against this, it is evident that the individual’s actions prima facie constitute offences under the Indian Penal Code, involving making sexually coloured remarks and stalking a woman with such intent,” she wrote on social media.

“Personally, I usually dismiss such rants from mentally disturbed persons with both contempt and pity. That does not mean I lack the ability to respond. The definition of one’s personal freedom does not include the liberty to insult another’s personal freedom,” Rose concluded. She later told Asianet News that if the said person continues to do the same, she will initiate legal action.

Frontline,2025-01-06 00:00:00,P. Ramamurti: Communist revolutionary and constitutionalist,"The first general election in India after Independence in 1952 saw the emergence of the Communist Party of India (CPI) as the most coherent ideological opposition to the Indian National Congress. Given that the ban on CPI had been lifted only a few months earlier and many of its top leaders continued to be imprisoned, it had little access to electoral finance, relatively little time to reconstruct its organisation for legal functioning, and even less time to mobilise people’s support. Therefore, its electoral success was significant. This was true in terms of the share of both the votes and the seats in Parliament.

The remarkable record of the CPI, during the 1940s, in mobilising people on land reforms, price rise, wages, workers’ rights, and the rights of various linguistic nationalities, contributed to its electoral successes in 1952. In the Madras Presidency, too, the CPI did very well. It was in a position to form a government with its allies but was thwarted from doing so by clever, even if not wholly ethical, political tactics employed by the Congress.

The tallest leader of the CPI legislature party was P. Ramamurti. Although he was only in his 40s PR, as Ramamurti was widely known, had been an active fighter for India’s freedom from his teens. He moved from the Congress to the Congress Socialist Party before joining the CPI in 1934.

Along with P. Jeevanandam, PR played a key role in expanding the communist party’s influence in the Tamil-speaking regions of the Madras Presidency. PR won the Assembly election from the North Madurai constituency even while he was in prison, a reflection of the popular support he and the CPI commanded, by virtue of their dedicated political work.

","In India’s 1952 general elections, the Communist Party of India (CPI) emerged as the main ideological opposition to the Congress despite limited resources and recent legal status. Its grassroots work on land reforms and workers’ rights fueled success, especially in Madras, where leaders like P. Ramamurti gained strong public support.",Politics,50,286

Recently, the actor spoke about his weight loss journey and the obstacles that came his way. Ram also gave his views on the dieting industry and pointed out serious flaws with them. During a podcast, he also shared his schedule and routine.

Sharing where it all began, Ram said, “I started about a year and a half back and have managed to lose 55 kgs till now. Initially six months I was doing very well, but then I had a very bad fall, and my shoulder got screwed. I had to undergo surgery, followed by 8 months of physiotherapy. So, everything on the weight loss front stopped, it was those six months and another 6 months after that helped me transform. I never took Ozempic or any other drug for weight loss, neither did I do bariatric surgery, but does any of that matter? However, it is not wrong to do any of that because people do so to become a better version of themselves.”

Ram Kapoor further revealed how people accused him of losing weight through surgeries or supplements, he said, “People said that I did bariatric surgery, but then why would I hide it? What I did was, for 5 years before I achieved this I went on a massive weight loss journey and shed 30 kgs, then I put it back on again. This helped me learn what I should not do, then I would stay up all night and read books by experts, and watch podcasts and I figured that there are two kinds of people in this world, one who cares about their fitness and health, and people who don’t.”

Exposing the dieting industry, Ram also pointed out some mistakes people end up making. “The entire dieting industry which is worth more than 20 billion dollars is designed to make you fail, otherwise how will they exist, if you don’t keep going back to them? They will always tell you we will make you lose the weight, but they don’t tell you that you also have to change as a person after that to not put on the weight again. If you see athletes never focus on weight loss, they look at fat percentage, BMI, etc.”

Ram also revealed his schedule and pointed out that strength training and good sleep are key factors. “I now eat twice a day, once at around 10:30 in the morning and then around 6:30 in the evening. Nothing for 8 hours in the middle, or 16 hours after that. Then I do 45 minutes of cardio, and 45 minutes of strength training, and monitor how much liquid you are drinking or sleep you are getting.”

Very few actors in present-day Hollywood could have breathed life into Elisabeth with such temerity. Even fewer actors could have made the role an extension of their decades-long careers. That is probably why, Demi Moore, who played Elisabeth, won her maiden Golden Globe in the recently conducted event.

Receiving her award, a smiling Moore said, “Thirty years ago I had a producer tell me I was a popcorn actress, and I thought I wasn’t allowed to have this.” Looking at the statuette in her hand, Moore continued, “I could do movies that were successful and made a lot of money but I believed that I wouldn’t be acknowledged.”

In fact, she revealed that a few years back, she assumed it was the end of the road for her in cinema. But then, the world had other plans. “A few years ago I thought that this was it, maybe I’ve done what I was supposed to do. And then, I had this magical, bold, courageous, out-of-the-box absolutely bonkers script come across my desk called The Substance and the universe told me you’re not done,” said Moore as the crowd went into raptures.

The actor, known for films like Ghost, A Few Good Men, Indecent Proposal, Love Sonia and The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, pointed out to the robust audience that what really matters is what we think of ourselves. “In those moments when we don’t think we are smart enough or pretty enough, or skinny enough or successful enough or basically just not enough, I had a woman say to me just know you will never be enough, but you can know the measure of your work if you just put down the measuring stick. I treat this as a marker that I do belong,” said an emphatic Moore.

In a video shared by Demi Moore’s daughter, Scout Willis, we can see her family wait with bated breath as her name was announced as the Golden Globe winner. Sharing the video, an excited Scout wrote, “She did it!!!”

But, he didn’t bag the award, also marking his fourth Golden Globe nomination. Not to mention, the rumoured couple chose not to make their first public appearance together on the red carpet. Kylie joined Timothee inside the venue for the Golden Globe Awards, similar to last year.

Recently, Timothee Chalamet also attended the 36th Annual Palm Springs International Film Society Film Awards. When asked about “partner-in-crime Kylie” at the event, he had said, “It’s a great feeling to be in a room with so much love and so many great peers and people that are fantastic. I like seeing the new way and the new generation here and I also like seeing everyone that’s been holding it down for decades-plus and probably people we haven’t even met yet.”","Timothée Chalamet and Kylie Jenner made a rare public appearance together at the 82nd Annual Golden Globe Awards, where they were seen sitting next to each other, sharing smiles and engaging in conversation. The couple's chemistry created a buzz on social media, with fans sharing pictures of them laughing and even exchanging a kiss at the event.

Indian Express,2025-01-06 00:00:00,Rohit Roy recalls surprising daughter Kiara who is studying at Brown University in USA: ‘I travelled for 20 hours… she started crying’,"Actor Rohit Roy opened up about his daughter Kiara and the bond they share. Rohit, married to actor Mansi, said fathers rarely show their emotions or feelings to their children but he decided to break the pattern when he booked tickets to the US on an impulse and travelled 20 hours to surprise his daughter who is studying at the prestigious Brown University. “I missed her badly, I booked the tickets and surprised her”, said the actor.

Recalling the incident, Rohit told Cyrus on his podcast, “I went to America to surprise my daughter. I just landed up at her door step. I think it was a Sunday morning, she looked at me and she was like, ‘Are you here?’ She started crying thinking she was hallucinating.” He also spoke highly of Kiara who is in her final year at the university and is scoring near perfect grades.
He said, “She is in the final year at Brown and I was missing her. For father, we can’t tell anybody anything. I said, ‘What do I do, I simply booked tickets and went to her. I was all alone. For once, Mansi didn’t say a thing. I landed at night, but I waited. I love to take Uber in the USA. I booked one in the morning and reached her. We spent seven blissful days together. I haven’t ever spent days like that. I regret I had nobody to record that moment.”

The actor shared he wanted to involve his daughter’s roommate in the surprise, so that she could at least record the entire thing, but he let it pass. “I thought, kids speak, and what if something slips out of her mouth. My whole 20-hour journey would have gone in waste. Also, Kiara is a kind of person who doesn’t like too much of pictures and videos.”

Though the actor couldn’t record that moment, he said, “I will never ever forget that moment. It is now imprinted in my mind.”

Previously talking about his daughter on RiteBite Max Protein TV YouTube channel, the actor said, “I feel like the luckiest man on earth to have Kiara in my life. She’s a truly sorted individual. She lives her life, she studies hard. She goes to Brown, and her GPA is 3.9 on 4.”

The actor had also shared that his daughter was offered a role in Zoya Akhtar’s The Archies, but she couldn’t give it a thought due to her education. He told The Indian Express, “About a year and a half back, I was at a fashion event hosted by Shabana Azmi. There was a great amount of media and paps and of course many stars. Later, Excel called me for The Archies. I told them that she is studying at the Brown University but I will check. I did tell her but she couldn’t give it a thought given the space she is in, where competition is intense. I have told her once you finish your education and want to give it a thought, we would wholly support you.”","Actor Rohit Roy shared a heartfelt story about surprising his daughter Kiara, who is studying at Brown University. Missing her deeply, he impulsively booked a flight to the US, traveled for 20 hours, and surprised her at her doorstep. Kiara was overwhelmed with emotion, initially thinking she was hallucinating. Despite his desire to capture the moment on video, Rohit respected his daughter’s preference for privacy. Kiara, in her final year, is excelling academically with near-perfect grades. Rohit expressed pride in her achievements and also mentioned that she had been offered a role in *The Archies* but chose to focus on her education instead.",Entertainment,103,527
Indian Express,2025-01-06 00:00:00,"Happy Birthday AR Rahman: From R Parthiban to P Vasu and Vasanth, iconic one-time collaborations that stand the test of time","There can be no doubt that the music of Rahman is mutually complemented by many filmmakers, who have become symbiotic with his name. Be it Mani Ratnam, the man who started it all, or Shankar, the man who brought it all together, or many more in Hindi (Subhash Ghai, Ram Gopal Varma, Ashutosh Gowariker, Imtiaz Ali, and Aanand L Rai), and Tamil (Gautham Vasudev Menon, Rajiv Menon, Bharathiraja and K Balachander), many filmmakers have managed to bring the best out of AR Rahman. Now, these are collaborations that are heralded often. So… on the occasion of his birthday, let’s look at a few of his combinations in Tamil cinema that lasted just for one film but provided songs that would stand the test of time.

AR Rahman and P Vasu

AR Rahman Love BirdsLove Birds was the only collaboration between Rahman and P Vasu

P Vasu, a veteran of Tamil cinema, made just one film with Prabhu Deva (Love Birds). In fact, it was a film that was a Kannada remake, which Vasu had written in the 80s. It was a film that would go on to be the inspiration for the debut of a superstar who would become one of the top dancers of Indian cinema (Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai). The Tamil film was Love Birds, and Vasu chose the right composer to elevate the music of this rather song-and-dance heavy film. 90s Rahman was a different beast altogether, and the entire album builds up to a crescendo, and continues to be a gift that keeps on giving. Did someone say Malargale?

AR Rahman and Vasanth 

Arjun and Meena from RhythmRhythm marks the only collaboration between Vasanth and Rahman

How did this combination work just once so far? If a composer gets a director like Vasanth who wanted the songs to represent the five elements, and if a director gets a composer who listens to the brief and delivers songs like the ones in Rhythm… how could they not keep on working? Imagine the kind of stories that could have been told in Rahman’s music. Imagine the kind of films Rahman would have worked if Vasanth continued collaborating with him. But that’s life, I suppose? Nevertheless, we would always have, Kattre En Vaasal at our doorsteps.

AR Rahman and Vikram Kumar

Suriya from 2424 marks the only collaboration between Rahman and Vikram Kumar

Another dream combo that would have done more wonders together seemed to have, for some reason, restricted to just one film. For all intents and purposes, 24 was quite the experimental film, and Rahman gave an album that was equal amounts bombastic, and equal amounts nuanced. Of course, the songs were good, but how good was the background score? You remember Athreya’s rage even better because Rahman amped up the proceedings. Sethuraman’s sacrifice gets even more profound because Rahman does what he does best. And Manikandan’s chirpiness gets elevated because Rahman never forgets to have fun with his music. Time is indeed love.

AR Rahman and Vasanthabalan

Siddharth and Prithviraj from Kaaviya ThalaivanKaaviya Thalaivan is the only collaboration between Vasanthabalan and Rahman

Vasanthabalan, an erstwhile assistant of Shankar, must have known Rahman for a really long time. And yet, it took him twelve years since his debut film to collaborate with Rahman. It was for a film called Kaaviya Thalaivan, a project that made Rahman research about the music of the 1920s. The album received blockbuster responses. It was celebrated. It was praised. It was criticised. It was even lambasted. Besides all that, Kaaviya Thalaivan provided Rahman with a challenge in Tamil cinema. He was tested for the first time by a film, and by a filmmaker who wasn’t a frequent collaborator. It was interesting to see Rahman conjure up something that would stand the test of time in a story set in the times of yore. We know street theatre of that era didn’t sound like what it did in Kaaviya Thalaivan, but what is cinema if not the willing suspension of disbelief in the promise that we’d be entertained. That’s a trick Rahman knew. He understood the assignment, always… but knew his audience too.

AR Rahman and Azhagam Perumal

Vijay and Simran from UdhayaUdhaya marks the first and last collaboration of Rahman and Azhagam Perumal

Azhagam Perumal, the long-time associate of Mani Ratnam, a long-time Rahman collaborator, roped in the Oscar winner for his sophomore film, Udhaya. This film marked the maiden project of Rahman and Vijay. However, the film, due to various reasons, including production delays, hit the screens much later. The lowkey release, and the rather non-masala premise of the film meant that the album didn’t get the love it deserved. It is actually impressive how Rahman reserves some of his more eclectic numbers, set within the mainstream parameters, for a Vijay film, which is as mainstream as it can get. Of course, the world knows all about Udhaya Udhaya, but what about being witness to the morning dew in a just pookum malar, or a conversational song addled with riddles in Enna Enna, and the most unlikely intro number, Thiruvalikkeni Rani.

AR Rahman and R Parthiban

Parthiban and Brigida from Iravin NizhalIravin Nizhal marked the first collaboration between Parthiban and Rahman

In cinema, it is always beautiful to see things fall in place. Did Parthiban think of Rahman when he decided to make a film that would be a single-shot cinema that would run for almost a couple of hours? Did Rahman even think that Parthiban, who has been in the industry for over three decades, would ask him to compose the music for his most outlandish attempt yet? Nevertheless, this collaboration happened, and it is Rahman at his experimental best. The outlandishness of the film allowed him to push the envelopes and do something so out-of-the-box, and completely novel. It gave him the opportunity to compose music for some unique situations, and bring out hitherto unexplored feelings. Guilt? Check. Remorse? Check. Pure villainy. Check. Unadulterated desire? Yes. Parthiban’s writing allowed Rahman to do a lot of things, and amidst all the chaos, he had the space to compose Maayava Thooyava that gave Shreya Ghoshal her fifth National award.

AR Rahman and Bharat Bala

Dhanush and Parvathy from MaryaanMaryaan was Bharat Bala’s debut movie, with music by Rahman

Honestly, words wouldn’t suffice to describe this collaboration that gave us Vande Mataram and Maryaan. One album that has become a testament to a citizen’s love for the country. One album that has become the bedrock of romance in Tamil cinema. I repeat… words wouldn’t suffice to describe this collaboration… Just close your eyes, and listen to Vijay Prakash sing, “Netru Aval Irundhaal”

Notable additions: AR Rahman and Manoj Kumar, Vikraman, K Subhash, and Suresh Menon

Interestingly, right after Roja, Rahman worked with a bunch of filmmakers who only worked in one film with him. But such was his meteoric rise in Indian cinema that, more often than not, he gravitated towards newer collaborations with more scope for experimentation, in terms of content and commerce. It is not like all of these filmmakers stopped making films after their projects with Rahman. It is just that, on retrospect, we understand that the music palette of their filmography were completely different from the work of Rahman, but in that one film, Rahman gave some of the best songs in their careers. You want a mother sentiment song for the ages? Give K Subhash’s Pavithra a hear. You want a sensual song that pre-dates the likes of songs heard in Daud and Rangeela? Give Manoj Kumar’s Vandisolai Chinraasu a chance. You want one of the best-ever intro songs for a heroine? There is Venus Balu’s May Maadham. And a dreamy folk number for the ages? Well, Nee Kattum Selai from Vikraman’s Pudhiya Mannargal will do the trick. And what new do we say about Suresh Menon’s Puthiya Mugam, except… Netru Illaadha Maatram ennadhu?","AR Rahman has had iconic collaborations with several Tamil filmmakers, each resulting in timeless music. Notable one-time collaborations include ""Love Birds"" with P Vasu, ""Rhythm"" with Vasanth, ""24"" with Vikram Kumar, and ""Kaaviya Thalaivan"" with Vasanthabalan, among others. Despite these being one-off partnerships, Rahman delivered unforgettable soundtracks that continue to resonate with audiences, showcasing his versatility and creative brilliance in diverse cinematic contexts.",Entertainment,63,1339

Ram praised Alia Bhatt and Varun Dhawan for their unwavering commitment to their projects. He also recounted an incident from his early days in the industry when an actor kept the cast and crew waiting for two days in Switzerland.

Speaking on the YouTube channel Let’s Talk With DevnaG, Ram said, “You could be a spoilt brat and still be a star back then, but you can’t do that today. Varun Dhawan, Alia Bhatt, Abhishek Bachchan… they are all professionals because they know they have to be that way. Alia is where she is because she’s so professional it will shock you. All of them come on set fully prepared. They ask the director, ‘Sir, what do you want?’ This is the industry these days—because if you’re not like that, then get out.”
Ram also lauded Akshay Kumar for his exemplary professionalism, highlighting how even superstars today must adhere to high standards. He said, “This has happened now. This wasn’t the case when I started. A lot of actors used to treat themselves like stars. Today, even Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan, Akshay Kumar… they’re all professionals. I just finished a film with Akshay, and he is more professional than anyone I have ever worked with in my life.”

Reflecting on Salman Khan’s work ethic, Ram added, “I’ve seen Salman partying and drinking, but when it comes to preparing for a film, he’s relentless. He’ll shoot till 12 at night, come home at 1 a.m., and work out till 3 a.m. They are all professional.”

Ram also shared a personal experience with an unprofessional actor early in his career. “When I started, there were actors who made people wait on set for two days—this happened in Switzerland. A crew of 80 people waited for him for two days. But now, this practice doesn’t exist,” he recalled.

Interestingly, Ram’s anecdote aligns with a previous statement made by producer Vashu Bhagnani. Bhagnani had revealed that Govinda once failed to show up on a film set in Switzerland for three days. However, when he finally arrived, he managed to complete most of his work in a single day.","Ram Kapoor praised the professionalism of today's actors, specifically Alia Bhatt, Varun Dhawan, and Akshay Kumar, highlighting their commitment and preparation on set.

“The commission has reached 60% in the Congress government. Even Congress workers admit to this. The commission is also being taken in allocation of houses. Earlier, PDOs used to take bribes, now ministers in Vidhana Soudha are taking commission,” he told reporters after visiting the Sri Chamundeshwari Temple.

Wondering if Chief Minister Siddaramaiah lives by Gandhi’s principle of Satyameva Jayate, Kumaraswamy said, “Let him answer to his own consciousness. Is there no limit to looting money? By facing harassment regularly, contractors who supported the Congress are saying that the previous BJP government was better. Siddaramaiah and the Congress government will have to pay the price for all this in the coming days,” he said.
He also blamed the Congress government of playing with the lives of people by increasing the bus fares.

“The state government is looking for an excuse to stop the guarantees at any cost. The government is taking money from the people with one hand and giving it back through schemes with the other hand. The state government is playing with the lives of the middle class,” he said.

This crucial route connects major destinations like Chikkaballapur, Ballari, Anantpur, Hyderabad and others and serves lakhs of commuters daily.

Anilkumar J, a regular traveller on the aforementioned route, highlighted critical issues such as non-functional lamp posts, faded lane markings, missing safety sign boards, and lack of hazard and speed-breaker signs. He also complained that there are traffic congestion at key intersections like Doddaballapur Cross and Devanahalli Cross.

He wrote to the PMO on November 24, 2024, detailing the urgent need for intervention. In his complaint, he proposed several measures to address the safety concerns on the NH44 stretch, including installing solar-powered lights along the median to improve nighttime visibility and placing reflectors along road boundaries and medians for better guidance.

He also suggested the installation of reflector-enhanced speed-breakers at critical points and the placement of hazard and signboards at strategic locations to alert drivers effectively.

Additionally, he recommended constructing subways at high-traffic zones like Doddaballapur Cross and Devanahalli Cross. Lastly, he emphasised the importance of biannual repainting of lane markings to ensure clarity and enhance road safety.

The PMO responded promptly, directing the NHAI to address the issue. NHAI has now initiated measures to enhance road safety, and improve infrastructure on NH 44.

The grievance was taken up by NHAI’s Project Implementation Unit, Bengaluru and the the authority said that overlay works are currently in progress, with plans to install safety furniture, including signboards, reflectors, and updated lane markings, upon completion.

As the bus fare hike came into effect from Saturday midnight, commuters on Sunday complained that autos are overcharging.

“Many autos operating in the city are not going by the metre and people are struggling to find autos. With the bus fare hike, this has come as another big blow. We get autos, only if we agree to pay whatever the drivers demand,” complained a regular auto user.

Voicing out their struggles, Prashanth, an auto driver said, “While the auto fares have remained the same, operational costs have increased year after year. Auto fares were revised in 2023 in Shivamogga, Mangaluru and Udupi, but Bengaluru, which has a much higher cost of living has not increased the fares. How are we supposed to operate our autos with the existing fares? Government must revise the fares soon.”

Meanwhile, auto unions like Autorickshaw Driver’s Union (ARDU), Adarsh Auto and Taxi Drivers’ Union and others have been urging the transport department to revise auto fares.

General Secretary of ARDU, Rudra Murthy agreeing that autos are demanding more money post the bus fare hike, said “Autos are struggling to operate under the current fare. We have been repeatedly requesting the government to revise the fare and make it an annual exercise. If this is done, a majority of the autos will be more than willing to go by the metre.”

The minimum metre fare should be revised from the existing Rs 30 per km to Rs 40 for the first two kilometres. Every subsequent kilometre should be revised from Rs 15 to Rs 20 per kilometre, he said.

They also urged that the State Government drop the idea of constructing big-ticket projects like tunnel roads and signal-free corridors and use the same money to strengthen the bus system. They demanded more buses, expanding bus services, creating exclusive bus lanes, and making travel by bus more affordable.

“The recent bus fare hike announced by Karnataka government is unfair and unjust. When the need of the hour is more buses and free public transport, the government is instead trying to discourage public transport by increasing bus fares. The fare hike will hit the working class hard. For the majority of the working class, the bus is their lifeline. It is unfair to penalise them for using public transport. We fear that those bus-users who own two-wheelers may move back to two-wheelers. Those bus users who are using premium services may also move back towards private vehicles,” BBPV stated in a press release on Sunday.

Mentioning that the government look at other ways to increase revenue as the increase in bus fare will make public transport more inaccessible, BBPV listed practical options to raise revenue for buses and public transport.

They suggested levying parking fees on all roads and levying congestion fee on private vehicle users, especially during peak hours. They also suggested instituting a traffic cess for private companies based on the extent of private transport use for office commutes by their employees.

“The State Government should stop all futile infrastructure projects like tunnel roads and flyovers as such projects have been proven to be ineffective in addressing traffic congestion. Solutions to Bengaluru’s traffic problems are bus priority lanes and more buses. Hence, we demand that the government fund more of these projects focused on prioritising bus-based public transport,” the forum added.","The Bengaluru Bus Prayanikara Vedike (BBPV) urged the Karnataka government to withdraw the 15% bus fare hike, advocating for alternative revenue sources like congestion and parking fees.

The department clarified that there is no cause for alarm as no cases of HMPV have been reported in Karnataka so far.

Health officials told The New Indian Express that an analysis of data on respiratory infections such as common cold, influenza-like illnesses, and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), revealed no significant increase in reported cases for December 2024 compared to the same period last year.

The state is prepared to handle any crisis, Dr Ansar Ahmed, Project Director, Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme, said.

Checklist

Do not self-medicate.

Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze.

Wash your hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.

Avoid crowded places and limit contact, specifically if you are unwell.

Do not frequently touch eyes, nose, and mouth.

The New Indian Express,2025-01-06 00:00:00,India reports three cases of HMPV; centre says well-equipped to handle respiratory illness,"India has reported three cases of globally circulating Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV), which is seeing an outbreak in China, causing worldwide panic as it comes five years after the COVID-19 virus, with three infants being detected in Bengaluru and Gujarat respectively.

The centre said on Monday that the virus is already in circulation globally, including in India, and is “well-equipped to handle any potential increase in respiratory illnesses.”

While two infants were detected with HMPV in Bengaluru, with no international travel history, one case was reported in Gujarat on Monday.

Earlier the Union Health Ministry said, “The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has detected two cases of Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) in Karnataka.

Both cases were identified through routine surveillance for multiple respiratory viral pathogens, as part of ICMR's ongoing efforts to monitor respiratory illnesses across the country,” a statement from the Union Health Ministry said, adding that they are monitoring the situation through all available surveillance channels.

It added that based on current data from ICMR and the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) network, there has been no unusual surge in Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) or severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) cases in the country.

The first case was reported in a three-month-old girl, who was diagnosed with HMPV after being admitted to Baptist Hospital, Bengaluru, with a history of bronchopneumonia. She has since been discharged.

The second case was of an eight-month-old boy who tested positive for HMPV on January 3 after being admitted to Baptist Hospital, Bengaluru, with a history of bronchopneumonia. The infant is now recovering, officials said.

“It is important to note that neither of the affected patients have any history of international travel,” the ministry added.

Gujarat Health Minister Rishikesh Patel confirmed that a two-month-old infant, from Dungarpur, Rajasthan, was detected with the virus in Ahmedabad and is undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Chandkheda.

According to unofficial information, “Doctors have placed the child on a ventilator for five days, during which tests confirmed the presence of HMPV.”

Despite the initial scare, the baby's health has stabilised, and authorities have urged residents to remain calm, emphasising there is no cause for panic. Health officials have assured the public of effective medical intervention while closely monitoring the case.

He added that patient will receive care based on their symptoms, and the government is taking swift action to make test kits available within the next two to three days.

Patel highlighted the government’s proactive approach: ""We are working on setting up a system to enable on-site testing for HMPV in hospitals, ensuring swift detection and response.""
HMPV, a respiratory virus that causes symptoms similar to the common cold and influenza, is seeing an outbreak in China. Photos and videos of overcrowded hospitals with people wearing masks have surfaced on social media.

The surge in infections of a respiratory virus has come as a reminder of COVID-19, which was detected in Wuhan, China, five years ago and which soon turned into a global pandemic, killing millions and crumbling economies.  

Most cases are mild, but young children, adults over 65 and people with weakened immune systems are at a higher risk for serious illness. HMPV is common and is most common among people before they turn five.

The health ministry emphasised that HMPV is already in circulation globally, including in India, and cases of respiratory illnesses associated with HMPV have been reported in various countries, including Japan and Malaysia.

“Union Health Ministry is monitoring the situation through all available surveillance channels. ICMR will continue to track trends in HMPV circulation throughout the year. The World Health Organization (WHO) is already providing timely updates regarding the situation in China to inform ongoing measures further,” it added.

Officials said that the recent preparedness drill conducted across the country has shown that India is well-equipped to handle any potential increase in respiratory illnesses. Public health interventions can be deployed promptly if needed.

Earlier, the Centre announced that it is monitoring the HMPV and other respiratory viruses following the surge of cases in China. To evaluate the situation, a Joint Monitoring Group (JMG) was held, which included representatives from the World Health Organisation (WHO), the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), and other health organisations.

HMPV, first discovered in 2001, is a part of the Pneumoviridae family and the Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

HMPV often causes upper respiratory infections but can sometimes cause lower respiratory infections like pneumonia and asthma flare-ups or worsen chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). HMPV infections are more common in the winter and early spring.

Researchers estimate that about 10 to 12 per cent of respiratory illnesses in children are caused by HMPV. Most cases are mild, but about five to 16 per cent of children will develop a lower respiratory tract infection like pneumonia.

HMPV spreads through direct contact with someone who has it or from touching things contaminated with the virus. The common symptoms are cough, fever, runny nose, sore throat, wheezing, shortness of breath, and rash.
On Saturday, the department released basic guidelines outlining do’s and don’ts and assured that the state is prepared for any emergency, if arises.

Do’s and don’ts - 

Do not self-medicate.

The New Indian Express,2025-01-06 00:00:00,"BJP plans to engineer defections in BRS, pave way for bypolls?","HYDERABAD: Speculations are rife in the Telangana political circles about possible by-elections to some Assembly constituencies in the state before the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) elections. The political circles are abuzz with questions as to which party is planning this, who is the mastermind behind the strategy, and the purpose of it.

Sources in the BJP, particularly from its Delhi circles, indicate that the party will turn its full attention to Telangana after Delhi Assembly elections and local body polls in Telangana.

The saffron party as part of its strategy to capture power in the state in the next Assembly elections is said to be making its moves. Its victory in eight Lok Sabha seats in the state has bolstered its confidence and now it has set its sights on wresting Telangana.

The sources stated that the Delhi BJP circles want to open doors to MLAs from the BRS in the event of party working president KT Rama Rao is arrested in connection with the Formula-E race case.

The BJP leaders plan to further strengthen the party base in the state by asking the pink party MLAs, particularly those from Hyderabad, to join their ranks and contest byelections. This, the sources said, will help the saffron party maintain momentum over the next four years.

Enhancing party’s image

Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Bandi Sanjay Kumar time and again said that the BJP would welcome into its fold MLAs either from BRS or Congress only if they resign from the Assembly before switching loyalty assumes significance in this contest.


The national BJP leadership, according to the sources, has come up with this idea after the Telangana leaders failed to improve the party’s image by aggressively taking up public issues. The high command wants to implement ‘Operation Akarsh’ with the help of party in-charges and Union ministers.

According to the sources, when the saffron party approached some rival party MLAs in Greater Hyderabad limits with its proposal, the latter expressed apprehension about their political future if they lose byelections.

To allay their fears, the BJP leadership is said to have offered them either nominated posts or any other position if the party comes to power in the next elections.

According to another talk doing the rounds, once a new BJP state president is appointed, efforts are likely to be intensified to woo BRS leaders, including its MLAs, into the saffron party.

Main opposition status

A senior BJP leader on condition of anonymity told TNIE that the plan is ready but the high command has put it on hold for now because of recent Assembly elections in some states and Delhi polls scheduled to be held soon. Once the Delhi elections are over, the high command will surely focus on Telangana to first secure the main opposition status and then move in for the kill, he said.

He also said that a few key leaders from Delhi may be in the forefront of its ‘Operation Akarsh’ campaign in Telangana. The BJP also will leave no stone unturned to gain control of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation in the coming elections.","Speculations of Telangana by-elections ahead of GHMC polls arise as BJP strategizes to strengthen its state base.

While a meeting was held by the temple committee members and other residents on Sunday, the meeting failed to conclude with any decision.

On Sunday, the temple committee alongside other leaders held an elaborate meeting at Maragodu VSSN hall to discuss the matter of allowing devotees’ entry into the temple wearing traditional attire, especially the devotees wearing the Kodava Kupya Chale. The meeting was held under tight police security.

Further, the meeting followed a peace committee held by the district administration over a week ago alongside leaders from Kodava and Gowda community.

Following a hint of communal unrest after a group of devotees wearing the traditional Kodava attire during the Mrityunjaya Temple festival were banned entry into the premises, the district administration called for a peace meeting even as the rituals inside the temple were being held under tight security.

The district administration had set a deadline as January 6 for the temple committee to arrive at an amicable decision. However, the meeting that was attended by Temple committee members alongside other local leaders failed to arrive at a decision.

The meeting was convened by the Temple Committee President Kattemane Shashi Janardhan, and a long discussion was held on the dress code and the developments that have taken place.

There were discussions for and against allowing Kodavas to come to the temple wearing kupya chale. After the meeting, the temple President Janardhan opined that the main demand of the Kodavas in the meeting was to allow them to wear Kupya chale. However, a decision could not be taken in the meeting.

Many people opposed the move of letting devotees in traditional attire to the temple. The opposition was in par with the temple bylaws that did not allow any section of the society to enter the temple in their traditional dress except the wearing Dhotis for the men devotees.

A report on the meeting is yet to be submitted to the district administration. “The temple committee has not yet submitted the report.

Goa Chronicle,2025-01-06 00:00:00,10 Guiding Points to Reflect When You Discover Your Boyfriend is Cheating,"Discovering infidelity is a deeply emotional and life-altering moment. While it’s easy to be consumed by anger and hurt, taking time to reflect can help you navigate the situation in a thoughtful, empowered, and psychologically healthy manner.

Allow Yourself to Feel Without Suppression
Why:

Suppressing emotions can lead to unresolved trauma later.
How:

Acknowledge your feelings—anger, sadness, betrayal—and allow yourself to process them without guilt.
Journaling, talking to a trusted friend, or seeking therapy can be helpful.
Avoid Making Impulsive Decisions
Why:

Acting in the heat of the moment (e.g., ending the relationship or retaliating) might lead to regret.
How:

Take time to cool down before deciding on your next steps. This gives you emotional clarity and prevents irrational actions.
Separate His Actions From Your Worth
Why:

Cheating often reflects his struggles or issues, not your inadequacy.
How:

Remind yourself that his choices are about him. Build affirmations around your strengths and value.
Examine the Relationship Objectively
Why:

Cheating can be a symptom of deeper issues within the relationship.
How:

Ask yourself:

Were there unresolved conflicts or unmet emotional needs?
Was the relationship healthy and fulfilling for both of you?
Consider His Motivations Without Justifying Them
Why:

Understanding why it happened can provide insight and closure.
How:

Reflect on whether his actions stemmed from:

Emotional disconnect
Situational factors (stress, vulnerability, etc.)
Personal insecurities or poor boundaries
Reflect on Your Emotional and Physical Needs
Why:


Cheating might indicate that the relationship isn’t meeting your needs either.
How:

Ask yourself:

Was I truly happy in this relationship?
Was I compromising too much or neglecting my emotional well-being?
Avoid Self-Blame
Why:

It’s easy to internalize the betrayal and question what you did wrong, but cheating is ultimately a choice your partner made.
How:

Challenge negative self-talk by focusing on the ways you contributed positively to the relationship.
Decide Whether to Stay or Leave With Clarity
Why:

Not all relationships can or should be salvaged after infidelity, but this is a deeply personal decision.
How:

Consider:

Can trust be rebuilt with effort from both sides?
Are you staying because you genuinely want to or because of fear (of loneliness, stigma, etc.)?
Seek Support to Gain Perspective
Why:

Infidelity can distort your thinking and amplify feelings of isolation.
How:

Talk to a therapist, counselor, or trusted friend who can provide unbiased perspectives and emotional support.
Focus on Personal Growth and Healing
Why:

Regardless of the relationship’s outcome, this is an opportunity to reflect, grow, and rebuild yourself.
How:

Invest in self-care and self-love practices.
Reflect on what you’ve learned about your needs and boundaries.
Use this experience to build resilience and emotional clarity for the future.
Discovering infidelity is heart-breaking, but it doesn’t have to define your future. By reflecting on the situation thoughtfully and prioritizing your emotional health, you can turn this painful experience into an opportunity for self-discovery, growth, and stronger relationships moving forward.","Discovering that your partner has been unfaithful is emotionally devastating. But instead of reacting on impulse, this guide encourages you to pause, reflect, and respond with clarity and self-respect. It begins by reminding you that your emotions are valid—whether it’s anger, grief, or confusion, allow yourself to feel them without shame.

The advice emphasizes not making rash decisions in the heat of the moment, instead encouraging calm, grounded thinking. Most importantly, it helps you remember that his betrayal is not a reflection of your worth—cheating is a personal failing, not your fault.

It invites you to explore your relationship honestly—were there unmet needs or emotional gaps? Understanding his motivations isn't about justifying them but gaining emotional closure. You’re also encouraged to reflect on your own needs and whether they were being fulfilled.

Throughout, the focus stays on self-compassion, healing, and clarity—not blame or revenge. Whether you choose to stay or walk away, the goal is to make that choice from a place of strength, not fear. Ultimately, this guide reframes betrayal as a potential turning point—an opportunity for deep self-discovery, growth, and empowerment.",Health and Wellness,183,481
the hindu,2025-01-06 00:00:00,Nothing alarming: on China’s HMPV cases,"Reports of many HMPV cases in China is reflection of heightened surveillance 
Five years after the SARS-CoV-2 virus overwhelmed hospitals in Wuhan, China, acute respiratory diseases caused by viruses including the human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in children and the elderly, and influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), are increasing in the country, especially in its northern provinces. However, the sharp rise in acute respiratory diseases is not unusual during this time of the year, and as per a Chinese official, the overall number of cases in 2024 would be “smaller” than in 2023. Surprisingly, while the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have not raised a red flag so far and there is almost nil reporting in the international media, the Indian media is awash with reports of an HMPV “outbreak” in China. A recent meeting of the Joint Monitoring Group under the aegis of the Union Health Ministry noted that the situation in China is “not unusual in view of the ongoing flu season”, and the “usual pathogens that are expected during the season” are causing the present surge in respiratory diseases. The HMPV virus was first identified in children in 2001 in the Netherlands. Infection with HMPV usually occurs by the age of five years with reinfection occurring throughout life as immune protection induced by the virus is too weak to prevent repeated infections. The virus causes upper and/or lower respiratory tract infections, with lower respiratory tract infections being among the most common. While the virus often causes only mild disease, it can lead to severe illness requiring hospitalisation in children, immunocompromised populations and the elderly.

Globally, 3%-10% of hospital admissions and 1% of acute lower respiratory infection-related deaths in children under age five in 2018 are attributed to HMPV, as per a 2021 paper. The study also found that children younger than six months, especially those in low- and lower-middle-income countries, are at greater risk of death caused by the HMPV virus. Detection of a large number of HMPV cases among children aged less than 14 years in China is a reflection of the heightened surveillance and testing for the virus. On the contrary, India does not have any approved inexpensive tests that are widely available for diagnosing the virus. When testing for HMPV in patients with acute respiratory disease should be routine, as the virus has been in circulation for years globally, including India, and fatality is 1% in young children, India is only now expanding the number of laboratories testing for HMPV beyond the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) network due to the spike in HMPV cases in China. What is also urgently needed is a regulatory framework that facilitates a rapid approval of diagnostic tests in the context of local and global outbreaks of novel and less known pathogens.

","The article discusses the recent increase in acute respiratory illnesses in China, particularly cases involving human metapneumovirus (HMPV), influenza, and RSV, especially among children and the elderly. Although Indian media has reported it as an “outbreak,” global health authorities like WHO and CDC have not raised alarms. Experts suggest the surge is typical for the flu season and reflects heightened surveillance and testing in China. HMPV, first discovered in 2001, is a common respiratory virus that can cause severe illness in vulnerable populations. While it accounts for 1% of deaths from lower respiratory infections in children under five globally, India lacks widespread, affordable testing for it.

The Pioneer,2025-01-06 00:00:00,Govt to launch another round of PLI scheme for steel sector,"he government will launch another round of production-linked incentive scheme for the steel sector on Monday.

The ‘PLI scheme 1.1’ will be launched by the steel minister H D Kumaraswamy.

“Union Minister of Steel and Heavy Industries...Will launch ‘PLI scheme 1.1’ for the steel industry and call for applications...On January 6,” the steel ministry said in a statement.

To encourage domestic production of specialty steel and lower imports by drawing in capital investments, the government had earlier introduced the PLI scheme for specialty steel.

The scheme has attracted investments worth Rs 27,106 crore, envisaging creation of 14,760 direct employment opportunities with an estimated production of 7.90 million tonnes of specialty steel.

As of November 2024, companies have already invested Rs 18,300 crore and generated over 8,660 in employment.

The government has been interacting regularly with the participating companies and based on feedback, it was felt that there was a scope to notify the scheme again to attract more participation, the statement said.

The concept of Production-Linked Incentives (PLI) was conceived during the Covid-induced global lockdowns of 2020, emphasising the need to boost domestic manufacturing.

Initially launched for three sectors, the PLI scheme was later extended to include steel in November 2020.

The government had earlier said that it is working on another round of the PLI scheme for speciality steel as the response for the first round of the initiative did not meet expectations.

Speciality steel is still one area where more is needed to be done. The government brought a PLI to incentivise the manufacturing of speciality steel but the offtake of the sops was not as expected, the government had earlier said.

Speciality steel is a high-grade product used in sectors like defence, automobile, and electrical, among others.'","The government is set to launch a new version of its Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for the steel industry, called 'PLI Scheme 1.1', on January 6. Led by Union Steel Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, the initiative aims to boost domestic production of specialty steel—an essential material used in defence, automobiles, and electronics—while reducing imports. The original PLI scheme, introduced in 2020, attracted investment pledges of over ₹27,000 crore and created thousands of jobs. However, actual participation fell short of expectations. So far, ₹18,300 crore has been invested and more than 8,600 jobs created. Based on industry feedback, the government believes there’s still untapped potential, prompting the relaunch to draw in more players and capital. This renewed push is part of India's broader strategy to strengthen self-reliance in critical sectors and support industrial growth through targeted incentives. With the global focus shifting toward resilient supply chains, the scheme could play a key role in positioning India as a hub for high-grade steel manufacturing.",Business and Finance,161,290
Goa Chronicle,2025-01-06 00:00:00,10 Guiding Points to Reflect When You Discover Your Boyfriend is Cheating,"Discovering infidelity is a deeply emotional and life-altering moment. While it’s easy to be consumed by anger and hurt, taking time to reflect can help you navigate the situation in a thoughtful, empowered, and psychologically healthy manner.

Allow Yourself to Feel Without Suppression
Why:

Suppressing emotions can lead to unresolved trauma later.
How:

Acknowledge your feelings—anger, sadness, betrayal—and allow yourself to process them without guilt.
Journaling, talking to a trusted friend, or seeking therapy can be helpful.
Avoid Making Impulsive Decisions
Why:

Acting in the heat of the moment (e.g., ending the relationship or retaliating) might lead to regret.
How:

Take time to cool down before deciding on your next steps. This gives you emotional clarity and prevents irrational actions.
Separate His Actions From Your Worth
Why:

Cheating often reflects his struggles or issues, not your inadequacy.
How:

Remind yourself that his choices are about him. Build affirmations around your strengths and value.
Examine the Relationship Objectively
Why:

Cheating can be a symptom of deeper issues within the relationship.
How:

Ask yourself:

Were there unresolved conflicts or unmet emotional needs?
Was the relationship healthy and fulfilling for both of you?
Consider His Motivations Without Justifying Them
Why:

Understanding why it happened can provide insight and closure.
How:

Reflect on whether his actions stemmed from:

Emotional disconnect
Situational factors (stress, vulnerability, etc.)
Personal insecurities or poor boundaries
Reflect on Your Emotional and Physical Needs
Why:


Cheating might indicate that the relationship isn’t meeting your needs either.
How:

Ask yourself:

Was I truly happy in this relationship?
Was I compromising too much or neglecting my emotional well-being?
Avoid Self-Blame
Why:

It’s easy to internalize the betrayal and question what you did wrong, but cheating is ultimately a choice your partner made.
How:

Challenge negative self-talk by focusing on the ways you contributed positively to the relationship.
Decide Whether to Stay or Leave With Clarity
Why:

Not all relationships can or should be salvaged after infidelity, but this is a deeply personal decision.
How:

Consider:

Can trust be rebuilt with effort from both sides?
Are you staying because you genuinely want to or because of fear (of loneliness, stigma, etc.)?
Seek Support to Gain Perspective
Why:

Infidelity can distort your thinking and amplify feelings of isolation.
How:

Talk to a therapist, counselor, or trusted friend who can provide unbiased perspectives and emotional support.
Focus on Personal Growth and Healing
Why:

Regardless of the relationship’s outcome, this is an opportunity to reflect, grow, and rebuild yourself.
How:

Invest in self-care and self-love practices.
Reflect on what you’ve learned about your needs and boundaries.
Use this experience to build resilience and emotional clarity for the future.
Discovering infidelity is heart-breaking, but it doesn’t have to define your future. By reflecting on the situation thoughtfully and prioritizing your emotional health, you can turn this painful experience into an opportunity for self-discovery, growth, and stronger relationships moving forward.

Remember to reach out for professional help if you find yourself feeling stuck.","Discovering infidelity is painful, but handling it thoughtfully can protect your emotional well-being. First, allow yourself to feel your anger and grief instead of suppressing them—journaling or therapy can help. Avoid impulsive decisions; give yourself time to reflect calmly. Remember that cheating is a reflection of your partner’s choices, not your worth. Try to look at the relationship objectively: were there unmet needs or deeper issues? Understanding his motivations may offer closure, but doesn’t excuse the betrayal. Resist blaming yourself—focus on how you contributed positively instead. Decide whether to stay or leave only after gaining clarity about trust, your true wishes, and fears. Seek support from friends, counselors, or therapists to gain perspective and avoid isolation. Finally, focus on your own growth: practice self-care, rebuild self-esteem, and reflect on your needs and boundaries. Though betrayal hurts deeply, this can become a chance to heal, grow, and build stronger, healthier relationships in the future.",Opinion and Editorial,153,494

This brings the total number of confirmed cases in the country to five. Union Health Minister JP Nadda reassured the public that health authorities are closely monitoring the situation, particularly in light of rising HMPV cases in China and other neighbouring countries.
On recent reports regarding the cases of HMPV in China, the Health Ministry, the ICMR (the Indian Council of Medical Research) and the National Centre for Disease Control are keeping a close watch on the situation in China as well as in the neighbouring countries, Nadda said.
India detected five cases of HMPV on Monday, January 6, itself. Two of the five cases were detected in Karnataka by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) through routine surveillance for multiple respiratory viral pathogens. Two more cases were later detected in Chennai. One case was detected in Ahmedabad.
Local Bengali news reports stated that a case was detected in Kolkata as well. A six-month old baby was admitted to a private hospital after being detected with HMPV virus. The child is now recovering, the report adds.
Minister Nadda stated that ""there is no reason to worry"", emphasising that India's health systems and surveillance networks remain vigilant and prepared to address any emerging health challenges.

Nadda clarified that HMPV is not a new virus; it was first identified in 2001 and has been circulating globally for many years. The virus spreads through respiratory droplets, primarily affecting individuals of all age groups, with increased transmission observed during winter and early spring months.
The Health Ministry, along with the Indian Council of Medical Research and the National Centre for Disease Control, is actively reviewing data on respiratory viruses and has reported no significant surge in common viral pathogens within India.
A joint monitoring group meeting was held on January 4 to assess the current health landscape, the Union health minister confirmed.

This milestone comes as the rivalry between Bezos and SpaceX founder Elon Musk intensifies.
According to a Federal Aviation Administration advisory, New Glenn is set to lift off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at 1:00 am (0600 GMT) on Wednesday, with Friday reserved as a backup launch window. While Blue Origin has yet to officially confirm the date, the excitement has been building since a successful ""hot-fire"" engine test on 27 December.
Sharing a video of the towering rocket's engines roaring to life, Bezos announced on social media platform X, ""Next stop launch.""
NG-1 Mission: A Defence PrototypeThe mission, dubbed NG-1, will carry a prototype of Blue Ring, a spacecraft funded by the US Department of Defense. Designed as a versatile satellite deployment platform, the spacecraft will remain aboard the rocket's second stage for a six-hour test flight.
This launch signifies Blue Origins long-awaited entry into the competitive orbital launch market, moving beyond its previous suborbital achievements with the smaller New Shepard rocket, which ferried passengers and payloads on brief trips to the edge of space.
Laura Forczyk, founder of space consultancy Astralytical, noted, ""The market is really orbital. Suborbital can only take you so far  there are limited payloads and customers for a quick ride to space.""
Rivalry Among Space BaronsThe milestone will escalate the rivalry between Bezos, the worlds second-richest individual, and Musk, who currently holds the top spot. Musks SpaceX has firmly established itself as the industry leader with its Falcon 9 rockets, which serve diverse clients, including NASA, the Pentagon, and commercial satellite operators.
New Glenn, named after astronaut John Glenn, is poised to challenge this dominance. Standing at 320 feet (98 metres), the rocket dwarfs the 230-foot Falcon 9 and is designed to carry larger payloads. Its reusable first stage will attempt a vertical sea landing, with the landing vessel whimsically named ""So Youre Telling Me Theres a Chance.""
Using liquid natural gas rather than kerosene, New Glenns engines offer cleaner combustion and require fewer engines overall. ""If I were still a senior executive at NASA, Id be thrilled to finally have some competition to the Falcon 9,"" remarked G. Scott Hubbard, a former NASA official now based at Stanford University.
Founded in 2000, Blue Origin predates SpaceX by two years but has advanced more cautiously. This deliberate approach has drawn criticism within the space community, as competitors like SpaceX have surged ahead.
Despite these challenges, analysts highlight the importance of competition. ""New Glenn provides the US government with dissimilar redundancy  vital for ensuring backup systems in case of failure,"" said space policy expert Scott Pace.
As SpaceX plans to phase out its Falcon 9 rockets in favour of the experimental Starship by the end of the decade, New Glenns debut could prove timely, offering alternatives in a rapidly evolving market.
For Bezos, who dreams of space colonies rather than Mars colonisation, New Glenn represents a significant step. If successful, it will not only secure Blue Origins place in the lucrative orbital market but also reignite its rivalry with SpaceX, setting the stage for the next chapter in the commercial space race.

Tajul Islam, the chief prosecutor of the ICT, emphasised the urgency of bringing Sheikh Hasina to justice, stating, ""We want to ensure the trial concludes as soon as possible,"" while affirming the importance of adhering to legal processes.
""We want to ensure the trial concludes as soon as possible, but that doesn't mean we will break the law or impose a verdict without due process,"" AFP quoted Islam as saying.
The interim government of Bangladesh, led by Nobel Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has prioritised Sheikh Hasina's extradition from India, having formally requested her return on December 23.
However, the Indian government has yet to respond to this request.
Shafiqul Alam, press secretary to the chief adviser, reiterated the government's determination to see Hasina face trial for her alleged crimes, indicating that ""pressure will build"" for her extradition.
Since Sheikh Hasina's departure from power, numerous Awami League allies have been detained for their roles in a violent crackdown that resulted in over 700 deaths among protesters.
Will Sheikh Hasina Be Deported?In common law jurisdictions, a trial cannot commence in absentia of an accused. To commence this trial, Sheikh Hasina must be present before the court and participate either physically or virtually.
While Bangladesh has asked India to extradite Sheikh Hasina via a diplomatic channel, the Indian government has not yet commented on this. Although there is an obligation on the state under customary international law under the aut dedere aut judicare principle to either extradite or prosecute any accused facing a grave international crime such as genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, enforced disappearance or torture, India is not obliged to extradite Hasina to Bangladesh.","Bangladesh has issued an arrest warrant for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. The warrant is related to alleged crimes against humanity during her time in office. India has asked Bangladesh to extradite Hasina, but the request has not yet been granted. Hasina was ousted from office in August after a violent crackdown on protesters.",National News,54,433

The acceleration of [Irans] nuclear program is leading us very close to the breaking point, Macron said during a speech to French ambassadors in Paris on Monday.
The country has sufficient material to fuel a handful of warheads, should its government take the political decision to move toward nuclear weapons.
Iran announced last month it would increase its nuclear fuel-making capacity in response to a rebuke from the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency over Tehrans failure to resolve a probe into uranium particles found at undeclared sites. Iran has maintained that its nuclear-development program is for energy purposes.
The IAEA is expected to produce a more comprehensive report as part of a broader western initiative to potentially reimpose or snap back UN sanctions on Iran before they expire in October 2025. That diplomatic mechanism was part of the now defunct nuclear deal that was abrogated in 2018 by then-president Donald Trump and which capped Iranian nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief.
The Iranian question is undoubtedly one of the main issues on which we will be re-engaging in dialogue with the new American administration, Macron said, referring to Trumps return to the White House later this month.
Iran operates thousands of centrifuges that spin at high speed to separate uranium isotopes. The machines typically produce low-level reactor fuel but can be programmed to make higher concentrations of uranium suitable for a weapon.
Citing Irans support to Russia against Ukraine, Macron described Iran as the biggest strategic and security challenge for Europe and its allies.

Mint,2025-01-06 00:00:00,BPSC paper leak: Fasting Prashant Kishor arrested from Gandhi Maidan by Bihar police. Here is why,"BPSC paper leak: Jan Suraaj party chief Prashant Kishor, who was sitting on an indefinite hunger strike at Gandhi Maidan in Patna, was arrested by Bihar Police early Monday morning, the party said.
A poll strategist-turned political leader, Kishor has been on a fast-unto-death since January 2 at Gandhi Maidan seeking cancellation of the integrated 70th combined (preliminary) competitive test conducted by the Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC) on December 13, due to an alleged a paper leak.
Kishor was 'forcibly' removed from Gandhi Maidan at 4 am and taken to AIIMS, Patna in an ambulance by the police, the party said. He was forcibly removed from the hunger strike site at 4 am. He has declined to take treatment and pledged to continue his hunger strike, the Jan Suraaj team said in a message on its WhatsApp channel.
A video shared by the news agency ANI showed senior officials of Patna police removing Kishor from the hunger strike site amid fierce opposition.
""Despite repeated requests by the officials concerned, they did not leave the place. They had also been served notice by the district administration to shift their dharna to Gardani Bagh, the dedicated place for holding protests, in the state capital, ""Patna District Magistrate Chandrashekhar Singh told the news agency PTI.
An FIR was also also filed earlier against Kishor and his supporters by the district administration. The administration deemed the protest at the site illegal. Kishor and others have been been accused of ""unauthorisedly"" gathering people, instigating them and creating a law and order problem.
Sitting under the icstatue of Mahatma Gandhi at Patnas Gandhi Maidan with scores of students, Kishor has been on a fast-unto-death since Thursday. Kishor is the first politician allowed to sit on dharna at the famous ground, instead of the designated protest site of Gardani Bagh.
Why is Prashant Kishor on hunger strike?Singh, the Patna DM said that, in accordance with a Patna High Court order, ""no dharna can be allowed at a spot other than the designated place in Gardani Bagh.'""
Kishor began the indefinite hunger strike demanding the cancellation of the BPSC examination due to an alleged paper leak. He started the hunger strike on January 2 after joining BPSC aspirants in their protest at Gandhi Maidan and criticised Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar for failing to meet with the students.
""This is against the egoistic government (of Bihar) whose leader CM Nitish Kumar did not consider meeting the students even when the students had agreed to withdraw the movement if the CM said that the exams couldn't be held... The students were beaten up by the authorities... There is only one way for people like us, Hence I am doing an indefinite hunger strike,"" he had said on Thursday.
Jan Suraaj, became a political party in October this year and is expected to contest in all seats of Bihar in the next year's assembly election.
The BPSC Exam rowNearly five lakh candidates had appeared at more than 900 centres across the state for the Combined Competitive Exams. Controversy arose after hundreds of candidates boycotted an exam centre in Patna, alleging a 'paper leak'.
The Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC) has denied the allegation and deemed it a conspiracy to get the exams cancelleddespite re-examination being ordered for more than 10,000 candidates, who had been assigned the Bapu Pariksha Parisar at the centre of the controversy.
The protesters have sought a cancellation of the entire examination and argue that retests for a small group of candidates will create an unfair advantage.","Jan Suraaj party chief Prashant Kishor was arrested by Bihar Police early Monday morning.

The Orissa Post,2025-01-06 00:00:00,Trump’s lawyers ask judge to halt Friday’s hush money case sentencing while they appeal to block it,"New York: President-elect Donald Trump asked a judge Monday to halt this week’s sentencing in his hush-money case while they appeal his recent rulings upholding the verdict.

Trump’s lawyers said they plan to ask a state appeals court to reverse Judge Juan M Merchan’s decision last week, which set the case for sentencing Friday — little over a week before he’s sworn in for his second term.

In a pair of rulings in recent weeks, Merchan rejected Trump’s bid to throw out the verdict and dismiss the indictment on presidential immunity grounds and because of his impending return to the White House.

In a decision last week, the judge signalled he is not likely to sentence Trump, a Republican, to any punishment for his historic conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. Acknowledging the demands of the transition process, he had given Trump the option to attend in person or appear virtually by video.

Trump’s lawyers argued in court papers Monday that their planned appeal to the Appellate Division of the state’s trial court triggers what’s known as an automatic stay, or pause, in the proceedings. If that doesn’t happen, they argued, Merchan should then grant a pause and prevent sentencing from happening on Friday as scheduled.

“Today, President Trump’s legal team moved to stop the unlawful sentencing in the Manhattan D A’s Witch Hunt,” Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung said. “The Supreme Court’s historic decision on Immunity, the state constitution of New York, and other established legal precedent mandate that this meritless hoax be immediately dismissed.”

A message seeking comment was left for the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which prosecuted the case.

While Trump asserted that presidential immunity and his looming second term necessitated nixing the verdict, Merchan wrote in his Jan 3 ruling that only “bringing finality to this matter” by sentencing Trump would serve the interests of justice.

The judge wrote that sentencing Trump to what’s known as an unconditional discharge — closing the case without jail time, a fine or probation — “appears to be the most viable solution”.

Trump will have an opportunity to speak at his sentencing, as will his lawyers and prosecutors. Once he is sentenced, he can appeal the verdict, as he has vowed to do.

Trump is on course to be the first president to take office convicted of felony crimes. In a social media post, he said it “would be the end of the Presidency as we know it” if the judge’s ruling upholding the May 30 verdict is allowed to stand.

The charges involved an alleged scheme to hide a hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the last weeks of Trump’s 2016 campaign to keep her from publicising claims she’d had sex with him years earlier. He says that her story is false and that he did nothing wrong.

The case centred on how Trump accounted for reimbursing his then-personal lawyer Michael Cohen, who had made the payment to Daniels. The conviction carried the possibility of punishment ranging from a fine or probation to up to four years in prison.

Cohen, a key prosecution witness who had previously called for Trump to be put in prison, said that “based upon all of the intervening circumstances” Merchan’s decision to sentence Trump without punishment “is both judicious and appropriate.”

Trump’s sentencing initially was set for last July 11, then postponed twice at the defence’s request. After Trump’s Nov 5 election, Merchan delayed the sentencing again so the defence and prosecution could weigh in on the future of the case.","President-elect Donald Trump has requested a judge to halt his sentencing in the hush-money case while his legal team appeals recent rulings that upheld the verdict. Trump's lawyers plan to appeal the decision by Judge Juan M. Merchan, who set the sentencing for this Friday, just before Trump’s second term inauguration. The case involves 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to a payment made to porn actress Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election campaign. Trump argues that presidential immunity should nullify the verdict, but Merchan has indicated that sentencing Trump without punishment could be the most viable option.

The Orissa Post,2025-01-06 00:00:00," Eight DRG jawans, driver killed as Naxals blow up SUV with IED in Bijapur district"," Bijapur: Eight jawans of the District Reserve Guard (DRG) and a civilian driver were killed after Naxals blew up their vehicle with a powerful improvised explosive device (IED) in Chhattisgarh’s Bijapur district Monday, police said. This was the biggest strike by Maoists on security forces in the state in the last two years and the first assault in 2025. Maoists detonated the IED near Ambeli village under Kutru police station area at around 2.15 pm when DRG personnel from Dantewada district were returning in their Scorpio vehicle after an anti-Naxalite operation, Inspector General of Police (Bastar Range) Sundarraj P said. All eight DRG jawans travelling in the SUV and the driver of the vehicle were killed on the spot, the official added. The DRG is a unit of the state police and its personnel are mostly recruited from local tribal population and also from surrendered Naxalites. Reinforcement was rushed to the spot and the bodies of the deceased were being evacuated, he said. A search operation has been launched in the area by security forces, the IPS officer informed. These DRG personnel were involved in an anti-Naxalite operation carried out for three days on the borders of Narayanpur, Dantewada and Bijapur districts by joint teams of security personnel, the IG said. Five Naxalites were killed in the three-day-long operation and one DRG head constable also lost his life, he said. After the operation, DRG personnel from Dantewada were returning to their base in the vehicle when the attack occurred in Kutru area, Sundarraj added. The last site is around 400 km from state capital Raipur. Visuals from the spot showed a huge crater, more than 10-feet deep, splitting the concrete road after the blast. The vehicle was completely destroyed in the explosion while dismembered bodies were seen placed on plastic sheets. A part of the vehicle was seen hanging on a nearby tree. Expressing grief over the death of DRG personnel and the civilian driver, Chief Minister Vishnu Deo Sai said Naxalites are frustrated with the ongoing counter-insurgency operation in the Bastar region and therefore, have resorted to such cowardly acts. Martyrdom of jawans will not go in vain, he asserted. “The news of the martyrdom of 8 jawans and a driver in an IED blast carried out by Naxalites in Kutru of Bijapur district is extremely sad. My condolences are with the families of the martyrs. I pray to God to rest the souls of the martyred soldiers in peace and provide strength to the bereaved families,” Sai said in a statement. “Naxalites are frustrated with the ongoing anti-Naxal operation in Bastar and have committed such cowardly act out of frustration. The martyrdom of the soldiers will not go in vain. Our fight to end the menace will continue strongly,” he added. In the past, numerous attacks have taken place on security forces in the Bastar region of Chhattisgarh, comprising seven districts including Dantewada, using IEDs. In the last major assault, ten police personnel and a civilian driver were killed after Naxals blew up their vehicle, part of a convoy carrying security personnel in neighbouring Dantewada district, April 26, 2023.

On Oct. 31, Shamsud-Din Jabbar recorded video with the glasses as he cycled through the French Quarter and plotted the attack, said Lyonel Myrthil, FBI special agent in charge of the New Orleans field office. Jabbar also wore the glasses, which are capable of livestreaming, during the attack, but did not activate them. A spokesperson for Meta, the parent company of Facebook, declined to comment. Here’s what the glasses are capable of: What are Meta glasses? Meta glasses, made in partnership with Ray-Ban, are frames with a built-in camera, speakers and artificial intelligence that can be controlled with your voice, buttons and some simple gestures. Some functions, such as listening to music or interacting with Meta’s AI assistant, require the device to be either paired with a phone or able to access the internet. The wearable does not have a display built into the lens, unlike some past industry attempts at building augmented-reality smart glasses. However, Meta has said it is working on a pair of glasses that will give users a fully holographic experience. What the glasses can do One of the glasses’ main selling points is the ability to capture images and video using the onboard camera, then upload those files to Instagram or Facebook. You can also livestream, but only to Meta’s compatible social platforms. You can also use the glasses to make audio and video calls, message people or listen to music. The camera also allows Meta’s AI assistant to see what you’re seeing, allowing it to translate text into multiple languages (spoken back to you, or shown on a paired phone app), and answer simple questions, such as searching the nearest landmark to your location. The glasses are largely a hands-free experience so you will be talking to your device — and it will reply. What the glasses can’t do The glasses currently cannot perform complex tasks that other digital assistants might be able to, like booking you a reservation at a restaurant or giving you turn-by-turn directions while you’re on the move. And there’s no display in the lens, so there isn’t a viewfinder for framing photos or video. There are also visual indicators built into the system that allow bystanders to know when you’re shooting video or taking photos. This LED privacy indicator stays on while you use the camera functions. According to Meta, you can’t disable this light to be more discreet in your actions.

The Orissa Post,2025-01-06 00:00:00,SC-panel meets Jagjit Dallewal post hearing on farmers’ protests,"New Delhi/Chandigarh: After the Punjab government informed the Supreme Court about a scheduled meeting with septuagenarian farmer leader Jagjit Singh Dallewal, a SC-appointed panel met him at around 3.30 pm Monday. A bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh was informed by senior advocate Kapil Sibal, representing the Punjab government, that the protesting farmers had been persuaded to meet Justice (retd) Nawab Singh, who chairs the apex court-appointed committee. “Some of us have been able to persuade those people under protest to meet Justice (retd) Nawab Singh led committee today at 3 pm. We are hopeful that there will be a breakthrough. Kindly take it up after a couple of days,” Sibal said. On hearing this, the bench said, “Let us hope and pray that better sense prevails on everyone.” The apex court asked Sibal to prepare a brief note of the deliberations and posted the hearing January 10. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, said the committee would file a brief note on the meeting’s outcome. During its meeting, the committee requested the ailing farmer leader to avail medical aid. Dallewal, who is the convener of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (non-political), has been on an indefinite hunger strike since November 26, 2024, pressing the farmers’ various demands, including a legal guarantee on the minimum support price for crops. He refused medical aid offered by the Punjab government and his condition deteriorated as he developed some health complications. On December 20, the apex court put the onus on Punjab government officials and doctors to decide on his hospitalisation. The top court said Dallewal could be moved to the makeshift hospital set up within 700 metres of the protest site at Khanauri border. In September, 2024, the SC formed the committee with the aim to amicably resolve the grievances of protesting farmers. The panel in its initial report flagged various reasons for agrarian distress and listed reasons including stagnant yield, rising costs, debts and inadequate marketing system. Aside from Justice (retd) Nawab Singh, the committee comprises retired IPS officer B S Sandhu, agriculture expert Devinder Sharma, professor Ranjit Singh Ghuman and Dr Sukhpal Singh, agricultural economist from the Punjab Agricultural University. Addressing the media after meeting Dallewal, Justice (retd) Nawab Singh said, “We pray to ‘Waheguru’ that he should be healthy.” On being asked whether Dallewal agreed to avail medical aid, Nawab Singh said, “We all repeatedly requested him for medical (help). We want his health to be good.” “I came here today not to say that the agitation should end,” the former judge said, “but to tell him his health should be good. I also told him that we are here whenever he says so.” Dallewal told the panel for him farming came first, his health later, said the former judge. Supreme Court judge Justice Surya Kant formed the committee with some confidence, he said. The committee reached the Khanauri protest site at around 3.30 pm and met Dallewal after the apex court hearing earlier in the day. The farmers under the banner of Samyukta Kisan Morcha (non-political) and Kisan Mazdoor Morcha have been camping at Shambhu and Khanauri border points between Punjab and Haryana since February 13, 2024, after their march to Delhi was stopped by the security forces.

Mint,2025-01-06 00:00:00,"Justin Trudeau resigns, asks Governor General to prorogue Parliament: What is it? Why did Canada PM do it?","Justin Trudeau Resigns as Canada PM: Justin Trudeau, a three-term prime Minister of Canada, on Monday, 6 January, announced that he was resigning from his post. He announced that he would resign as the leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. The prime minister also asked Governor General Mary Simon to prorogue Parliament until March 24.
Catch LIVE updates on Justin Trudeau resignation
Once Canada Parliament has been prorogued, all current bills will die, and the federal government will not pass any legislation until after Parliament has reconvened, reports CIC.
What it means to prorogue  and why Justin Trudeau is doing it.
What does it mean to prorogue Parliament?Prorogation is a formal political process that marks the end of a parliamentary session, effectively pausing all parliamentary activities for a predetermined period. During prorogation, Members of Parliament (MPs) are sent home, and no committees can convene.
Any bills that have not received assent are set aside and must be reintroduced in the next session.
This process allows a government to reset its agenda and prepare for a new legislative session, often accompanied by a fresh throne speech and budget. Following prorogation, Parliament will reconvene for the State Opening, where a new session begins.
Prorogation vs Dissolution: It is important to distinguish prorogation from dissolution, which terminates Parliament entirely and leads to an election. While prorogation halts parliamentary business, MPs continue to hold their seats and can engage in constituency work.
Why did Justin Trudeau prorogue Canada Parliament?By suspending parliamentary activities until March 24, Justin Trudeau aims to buy time for a leadership race within his party while also seeking to ""calm the waters"" after a tumultuous 2024, reports Toronto Star.
Trudeau, on Monday, also acknowledged that Parliament has been ""paralysed for months,"" following what has been the longest session of a minority government in Canadian history.
However, political analysts, including Kathy Brock, told Toronto Star that this strategy could backfire. Brock remarked, ""Is it a wise decision? Its a very risky one,"" highlighting that Canadians are growing weary of political manoeuvring and are eager for resolution.
When will Canada Parliament return?Justin Trudeaus prorogation will end March 24 after a break of about two and a half months.
Why did Justin Trudeau resign?In his resignation speech, a teary-eyed Justin Trudeau said it had become clear to him that he could not ""be the leader during the next elections due to internal battles. He plans to stay on as prime minister until a new leader of the Liberal Party is chosen.
I dont easily back down faced with a fight, especially a very important one for our party and the country. But I do this job because the interests of Canadians and the well being of democracy is something that I hold dear,"" he said.
Was Canadian Parliament prorogued before?According to Toronto Star, prorogation has been used as a political tool since confederation. In 1873, Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald requested the Governor General to prorogue Parliament to avoid a committee investigation into allegations of corruption against him.
Justin Trudeau prorogued Parliament for a month in August 2020 during the WE charity scandal, which then-Conservative leader Andrew Scheer called spineless and a disgusting attempt to make Canadians forget about his corruption.
In December 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper requested the Governor General to prorogue as his government teetered on the brink and the Liberals and NDPs had proposed a coalition government supported by the Bloc.

He added that he will continue as the PM until the party names a replacement through a “robust, nationwide, competitive process.”

Announcing his plans of stepping down at a press conference in Ottawa, Trudeau said, “I intend to resign as party leader as prime minister after the party selects its next leader through a robust, nationwide competitive process. This country deserves a real choice in the next election, and it has become clear to me that if I’m having to fight internal battles, I cannot be the best option in that election.”

Trudeau, 53, took office in November 2015, making him one of Canada’s longest-serving prime ministers. However, his popularity has been on the decline for the last two years, in large part due to public anger over inflation and a housing crisis. According to news agency AP, recent polls have shown the Liberals suffering a bad electoral loss to the official opposition Conservatives in the next election, slated to be held by late October this year.","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced his resignation as the leader of the ruling Liberal Party after more than nine years in office.

Indian Express,2025-01-07 00:00:00,Rajinikanth refuses to answer question on women’s safety in Tamil Nadu: ‘Don’t ask political questions’. Watch,"Once just inches away from launching his own political party, superstar Rajinikanth now appears to have distanced himself from politics entirely. Incidentally, his current stance is such that he even refrains from addressing sociopolitical topics, including women’s safety. Now, a video of him, popularly referred to by his fans as “Thalaivar” (leader), declining to respond to a reporter’s question about women’s safety in Tamil Nadu has gone viral on social media and grabbed much attention since it follows closely on the heels of a recent case where a student was sexually assaulted at Anna University in Chennai.

When Rajinikanth was spotted at the Chennai airport recently, he was quickly surrounded by fans and journalists. Speaking about the progress of his upcoming film Coolie, which is currently in production, the actor revealed that 70 per cent of the shoot is complete, with a new schedule planned from January 13 to 28. However, when a journalist raised the subject of women’s safety in Tamil Nadu, Rajinikanth interrupted, saying, “I have already said not to ask me political questions, ok?” He then walked away, avoiding further questions.

Rajinikanth’s potential political entry had been a subject of national fascination for decades before he ultimately decided against venturing into the arena.

In 2020, Rajinikanth had announced plans to launch his political party in January 2021, coinciding with the impending Tamil Nadu Assembly elections. However, just days before he was expected to reveal further details, he declared that he would not be entering politics due to health concerns, thus ending years of speculation.

Alia Bhatt made her acting debut with Student Of The Year (SOTY) in 2012, along with newcomers Varun Dhawan and Sidharth Malhotra. The actor, who was only 19 years old when she entered the industry, was considered childlike by many. In a recent interview with Siddharth Kannan, actor Ram Kapoor, who played a pivotal role in SOTY, shared his thoughts on how people’s perception of Alia Bhatt has evolved over the years.

During the conversation, Ram revealed that everyone was looking at the Gangubai Kathiawadi actor with a sense of doubt. He said, “Everyone was so young. The industry is so hard that everybody was looking at her with doubt. Alia was the youngest. At that point, if you told anyone that Alia would achieve what she has achieved today, nobody would believe.”
He added that many people thought that Alia Bhatt’s Student of the Year co-stars Varun Dhawan and Sidharth Malhotra stood a better chance in the film industry. “She was a small little baby, literally. She still had baby cheeks. She is not the Alia of today. For Varun and Siddharth, people thought that maybe they have a chance, but Alia was such a baby.

The two met through family members soon after Govinda finished his graduation and was yet to make a name for himself in the movies. In an earlier interview, Sunita said that when she was told about Govinda by her sister’s husband, who was related to Govinda, she was given the impression that he doesn’t talk to women. In fact, she was told that he had been violent with two women. Shockingly, this intrigued Sunita and she showed an interest in meeting him.

During an appearance on Jeena Isi Ka Naam Hai in the early 200s, Sunita shared that she first heard about Govinda through her Jeejaji (brother-in-law) as he would often praise his good looking nephew. When Sunita asked more about him, she was told that he doesn’t talk to women. “My brother-in-law said that he hits girls. He said you don’t talk to him. He said Govinda had actually hit two girls in his college. One of them, he hit with an umbrella. And the other girl, he threw hot milk on her face. So he doesn’t talk to girls at all,” she recalled as the couple laughed at the story.
Sunita then continued, “So I was wondering who is this boy who doesn’t talk to girls. I told my Jeejaji you call him, I will talk to him. That’s when I met him.” The two got married soon after. Sunita was just 18 when they tied the knot and in a recent interview with Hauterrfly, she revealed that her father did not attend the wedding as he did not approve of their union.

In an 1990 interview to Stardust, Govinda said that he contemplated breaking up with Sunita as he fell in love with actor Neelam Kothari. “I couldn’t stop praising her (Neelam). To my friends, to my family. Even to Sunita, to whom I was committed. I would tell Sunita to change herself and become like Neelam. I would tell her to learn from her. I was merciless. Sunita would get irritated. She would tell me, ‘You fell in love with me because of what I am, don’t ever try to change me.’ But I was so confused. I didn’t know what to own.” In the same interview, the actor confessed that he “never meant to get so seriously involved with Sunita. I was looking for a girl to go around with.” Govinda said that he had to perform a romantic scene on-screen but was quite uncomfortable with the idea of it, so his brother suggested that he should go out with someone to “get some experience of romance.”","Govinda and his wife Sunita Ahuja, married since 1987, met through family connections when Govinda was still struggling in his acting career.

A couple of entrepreneurs, Karan and Advita, appeared on the premiere episode to pitch their concierge service called Indulge. They said that they are targetting the 12,000 ‘ultra-high net worth’ individuals currently residing in India, and that their service will offer everything that the clients need in terms of ‘travel, retail, dining, experiences, and special requests.” The panel of ‘sharks’, including Anupam Mittal, Peyush Bansal, Namita Thapar, Vineeta Singh and Aman Gupta, were divided over the need and scalability of the business. They asked for Rs 50 lakh in exchange of 1% equity.

The pitchers said that they currently have 183 paying customers, whom they charge either Rs 40,000 per month or Rs 4 lakh per year, plus expenses. Anupam was sure that they also earn a commission from their partners, and the entrepreneurs confessed that they make 5% on every deal they strike with their  brand partners. Anupam wasn’t convinced by the ethics of the operation, and wanted to know if they are fully transparent with their clients about this back-room deal-making. They said that their clients don’t need to know.

Anupam said that he, and several ‘UHNW’ individuals like him, already have ‘executive assistants’ to look after their personal needs. Aman, on the other hand, said that he’s the kind of person who counts every rupee that he spends, and that he can’t resonate with the model at all. Peyush joked that Namita is the perfect candidate for such a service, as she ‘travels with an entourage’. He was also interested in knowing what some of the weirdest requests that the entrepreneurs have received from their clients. They narrated a story about supplying a Diet Coke can for a client in a village in the Himalayas. They said that it cost them Rs 4,000. Aman was stunned. “Rs 4,000 for a can of Coke?” he remarked.

The entrepreneurs said that they also have an app, through which clients can purchase anything from a ‘villa, yacht, and art’. Anupam posed piercing questions about their revenue, and wasn’t too happy with what he heard. “My biggest problem is credibility, I don’t believe what you’re saying, your numbers simply don’t match up with the picture you’re painting. You need a lot more clarity before you raise capital from an investor,” he said.

Aman, Namita and Vineeta also backed out of the deal. Peyush showed some interest, but just as he asked the entrepreneurs to explain their equity breakup, he discovered a previously undiscussed detail that made him change his mind. The entrepreneurs said that the billionaire Nikhil Kamath gave them Rs 75 lakh in seed funding at the very beginning of their journey, but has since exited the business. Peyush said that because of this lack of confusing detail, he wanted to back out. In the post-pitch piece to camera, the pitchers appeared to be sour about the experience.

On the late actor’s birth anniversary, we go back in time when the film’s producer Nikkhil Advani revealed that he was reluctant to cast the Khiladi actor and wanted to star Irrfan instead. However, the latter believed that the producer might get a bigger budget to make the film if Akshay featured in it.

While talking to Galatta Plus in an interview, Nikkhil recalled the instance and said, “Airlift’s director Raja Menon wanted Irrfan, which was fine for us because he was working on D-Day. I told them I would set up the meeting with Irrfan, and Irrfan overheard me. He told me, ‘Boss, mere sath mat kar ye picture (Don’t do this film with me).

Indian Express,2025-01-07 00:00:00,Pushpa 2 Worldwide Box Office Collection Day 33: Allu Arjun’s film trails Dangal by Rs 192 crore; can it catch up?,"Pushpa 2 Worldwide Box Office Collection Day 33: The unprecedented success of Allu Arjun, Rashmika Mandanna and Fahadh Faasil’s Pushpa 2: The Rule, directed by Sukumar, may be starting to wane as the film completes over a month at the box office. Having already achieved the distinction of becoming the biggest hit in Indian cinema, with a staggering collection of Rs 1,206 crore nett, the film has displaced SS Rajamouli and Prabhas’ Baahubali 2: The Conclusion from the top spot. The latter had collected Rs 1,030 crore back in 2016. Pushpa 2 has also made history by becoming the first film from the South of India to cross the Rs 500 crore mark in Hindi, with its current earnings standing at Rs 791.65 nett crore in Hindi, as per Sacnilk. However, according to the film’s banner — Mythri Movie Makers — the film’s overall gross collection stands at Rs 1,832 crore in 32 days.

What’s notable is that Pushpa 2 was looking to break the box office record of Aamir Khan’s Dangal (2016), which grossed Rs 2,024 crore. With Pushpa 2 still running in theatres, it will be interesting to see if it can indeed break Dangal’s record. As of now, Pushpa 2 is still short of Dangal’s record by Rs 192 crore. However, according to early estimates by Sacnilk, the film’s box office performance has slowed down significantly, with its day 33 collections standing at Rs 2.5 crore, a drastic drop from its Sunday collections of Rs 7 crore. The trade is anticipating a further decline in ticket sales, as the New Year festivities have come to an end and the work week has begun. Nevertheless, the film is expected to experience a resurgence in its collections over the weekend, as no major films are releasing this week, except for Sonu Sood’s Fateh, which has generated minimal buzz.

Despite facing competition from films like Mufasa: The Lion King and Varun Dhawan’s Baby John, Pushpa 2 has demonstrated remarkable resilience at the box office. However, trade experts are cautious about the challenges that lie ahead in January, with the upcoming releases of Akshay Kumar’s Sky Force and Shahid Kapoor-Pooja Hegde’s Deva. The underwhelming performance of Varun Dhawan’s Baby John, which failed to breach the Rs 40 crore mark despite its festive release, has raised eyebrows in the industry. Interestingly, Baby John’s poor showing has had an unintended benefit, allowing Pushpa 2 to maintain its momentum in cinemas, with Unni Mukundan’s Marco also reaping the rewards. As Pushpa 2 continues its run, fans are eagerly anticipating the next installment of the franchise.","*Pushpa 2: The Rule* has made history by becoming the highest-grossing Indian film with Rs 1,206 crore nett, surpassing *Baahubali 2*'s record. The film also achieved the milestone of crossing Rs 500 crore in Hindi earnings. However, its box office collections have started to slow down after over a month of release, with Day 33 earnings of Rs 2.5 crore, significantly lower than its previous Sunday collection. Despite this decline, the film still has the potential to break the global box office record of *Dangal* (Rs 2,024 crore) if it picks up during the weekend. The film faces competition from upcoming releases like *Sky Force* and *Deva*, but its resilience has been notable amidst other films' underperformance. Fans eagerly await the next installment of the franchise.",Entertainment,126,451
Indian Express,2025-01-07 00:00:00,"Even Govinda’s kids ignore his advice; negative influence ruined his bond with David Dhawan, says Sunita Ahuja: ‘He’s stuck in the 90s’","Govinda was one of the most bankable actors of the 90s, with his collaborations with filmmaker David Dhawan resulting in numerous iconic hits like Saajan Chale Sasural, Bade Miyan Chote Miyan, Hero No 1, Raja Babu, and many more. However, their successful partnership eventually fell apart after working together in 18 films. In a recent interaction, Govinda’s wife, Sunita Ahuja, blamed negative influences around the actor for ruining his relationship with David. She also revealed that Govinda is still stuck in the 90s, so much so that even their children don’t take his advice seriously.

Speaking on the YouTube channel Hindi Rush, Sunita said, “I always say David is like my father. Back then, actors used to have a lot of ‘chamchas’, and they would create misunderstandings. People became jealous seeing the partnership between David and Govinda. When you surround yourself with negative people, you’re bound to absorb their negativity.”
Sunita defended David Dhawan and said the filmmaker had never said anything wrong to Govinda but only advised him to adapt to changing times. “David didn’t say anything wrong. He said that in the 90s, solo-hero films worked, but that’s no longer the case. Rarely do they succeed today. David suggested that Govinda take up second-lead roles, but not insignificant ones. After all, he played a second lead in Bade Miyan Chote Miyan, and that wasn’t a bad choice. But people around Govinda would provoke him, saying, ‘You’re the hero.’ It makes me angry to see how these things happened. The people in Govinda’s circle weren’t good; they instigated him against.”

Addressing Govinda’s recent announcement about making a comeback, which he revealed on The Great Indian Kapil Show, Sunita shared her mixed feelings. “I think he has made some announcement about doing three films,” she said uncertainly. However, she added that she prefers to withhold her opinion until she hears more about the projects. “I say it on the face good or bad, I am not going to do chamchagiri whether you are my husband or Govinda. I am not ‘Waah waah’ production, I’m ‘sahi sahi’ production,” she said.

Sunita also opened up about their son Yashvardan Ahuja, who is set to make his Bollywood debut in 2025, and how he doesn’t follow Govinda’s career advice. “Nobody listens to Govinda’s advice because it’s stuck in the 90s. I give advice suited to 2024. We keep telling Govinda to move on from the 90s.”","Govinda's wife, Sunita Ahuja, recently discussed the decline of the actor's successful partnership with filmmaker David Dhawan, blaming negative influences around Govinda for the rift. She defended Dhawan, stating that his advice to adapt to changing times was misunderstood.

Indian Express,2025-01-07 00:00:00,"Chandrachur Singh refused to back out when he heard Salman Khan was replacing him in Kya Kehna, recalls Ramesh Taurani","Kya Kehna (2000) was a significant film in Preity Zinta’s career as it established her as one of the most promising leading ladies of her time but the movie faced many hurdles when it was being made. In a recent interview, producer Ramesh Taurani revealed that distributors were not keen on buying the film as it had relatively smaller stars – Saif Ali Khan and Chandrachur Singh. Ramesh said that at one point, he requested Chandrachur to leave the movie so he could cast Salman in his place. Salman agreed even without hearing the script, but then Chandrachur refused to leave the project.

Talking to Radio Nasha Official, Ramesh said that they initially cast Mukul Dev and Chandrachur Singh but Mukul did not show up on the first day of the shoot, so casting Saif Ali Khan was a last minute decision. He said that this film was being made shortly after the assassination of Gulshan Kumar so they had to get the distributors in place to sell the film in an unpredictable market. At this point, Ramesh asked Chandrachur to drop out of the movie so they could cast Salman instead. “I spoke to Chandrachur and I told him that we can’t sell the film. We asked him to drop out of this film so we can sell it. We were in a dire situation and we had never done something like this,” he recalled.
Chandrachur agreed and subsequently, Taurani spoke to Salman Khan, who instantly agreed to be a part of the movie. “He said I don’t even want to listen to the plot. I will do it just because you have asked me to. But you have to get a letter of consent from Chandrachur. I don’t want to take something that belongs to someone else, something that’s cursed,” he said.

Ramesh Taurani said that soon after this conversation, the news somehow got leaked to the press and by this time, Chandrachur Singh decided that he did not want to back out of this project as he believed that it would be foolish to back out of a Tips production. Salman then asked Taurani to finish the project with Chandrachur.

Indian Express,2025-01-07 00:00:00,"Angry Shark Tank India pitcher tells Anupam Mittal to stop making ‘befaltu excuses’ if he doesn’t want to invest, advises Peyush Bansal","The fourth season of the reality show Shark Tank India began with some dramatic new pitches. The first episode saw entrepreneur Gauri Varma from Delhi pitch her confectionary brand, Confect, to the panel of ‘sharks’, which included Peyush Bansal, Anupam Mittal, Namita Thapar, Vineeta Singh and Aman Gupta. Gauri asked for Rs 1 crore in exchange of 1% equity, putting the valuation of her brand at Rs 100 crore. The pitch ended in an argument between Anupam and Namita, who were divided over Gauri’s honesty.

Gauri said that she first got the idea to enter the cakes business after eloping with her husband and getting married in Las Vegas. She said that they spent Rs 36,000 on their wedding cake, which turned out to be an eyesore. Over the next few years, she learned everything that she could about food technology, and started creating fondants and sprinkles. She expanded her business further, and her range of products eventually grew to 800. “This is a big mistake, by the way,” said Peyush, advising Gauri to focus on perfecting fondants before spreading herself too thin. Gauri didn’t seem to appreciate the feedback.

Anupam, on the other hand, was struck by something she said in the pitch. Gauri had admitted that she begins to feel restless every few years, after which she develops an itch to start something new. Anupam said that it is her ‘fitrat (nature)’ to get restless, and this makes him uneasy about betting on her. His biggest point of contention was Gauri’s decision to abandon her business in India and pivot to the United States. She said that in just 18 months, her US sales have hit Rs 8.5 crore, and that she intends to branch out in new countries with a round of investment.

Aman was also uncertain. He said that she quickly moved away from the Indian market at the first sign of trouble. “Where will you run away to when you sense trouble in the US?” he asked. Because Gauri was so keen to focus on the US market, Namita said that she would make her an offer on the condition that she balance her business, and devote equal attention to India. She offered Gauri Rs 1 crore for 2% equity, and asked for royalty until she makes her Rs 1 crore back. Despite her initial valuation being halved, Gauri gladly accepted the offer.

Anupam was stunned. He pointed out how easily she flipped on everything that she had said in her pitch. But Namita defended her, and said that she needn’t pay attention to him, especially since she had cracked a deal. “Your superpower has a dark side that doesn’t let you learn from failures, and that can hold you back,” Vineeta told Gauri as she left. In her post-pitch piece-to-camera, Gauri didn’t seem pleased with how she was treated, especially by Peyush and Anupam. “Ab ho rahi hai na FOMO?” she said about Anupam. “Felt like telling Peyush he should sell just one design at Lenskart,” she said. “They don’t understand the first thing about cakes, befaltu ke excuses mat do,” she added, noting that the ‘sharks’ should’ve simply said that they are not interested in making a deal, instead of giving her worthless advice.","In *Shark Tank India* Season 4, Gauri Varma pitched her confectionary brand Confect, seeking Rs 1 crore for 1% equity. Despite concerns from the sharks about her quick pivots and focus on the US market, Namita Thapar offered Rs 1 crore for 2% equity, which Gauri accepted. The pitch ended with tension as Gauri felt the sharks' advice was unhelpful and criticized them for not directly rejecting her offer.",Entertainment,69,570
Indian Express,2025-01-07 00:00:00,Ram Kapoor had to ‘become Prachi Desai’s legal guardian’ during Kasamh Se shoot to enter Dubai: ‘I had a 17-year-old heroine opposite me’,"After making headlines for his stunning body transformation, Ram Kapoor has, for the first time, opened up about his experience of working with Prachi Desai in the Zee TV show Kasamh Se (2006), where he played the lead role opposite a 17-year-old Prachi. Ram was in his 30s then. In a recent conversation, Ram revealed his thoughts on the significant age gap between him and his co-star, and whether he felt awkward about it.

“I was the main lead, I was the hero and I had a 17-year-old opposite me, what is the problem? The story was such! She was 17 when she started working. When we went to Dubai for shooting I had to sign a form and become her legal guardian to enter the country. But the story was such and I trusted Ekta (Kapoor, the maker of the show). I trusted her casting. At that time she (Prachi) was totally new but look at how fantastic she was in Kasamh Se,” he said in an interview with Siddharth Kannan.
Ram also shared his thoughts on the apprehensions that come with being an actor. “How can you have apprehensions if you want to be an actor? Otherwise you become a dhobi and wash clothes! You want to be an actor! That means you want to do anything and everything. You want to do roles 20 years older, you want to do roles younger… you want to work with children… How can you have (apprehensions)? Are you an actor or not?” he exclaimed.

Ram revealed that he is still in touch with Prachi, affectionately referring to her as “Bacchi hai meri (She is like my child)”. He shared, “Bilkool. Bacchi hai meri. Recently, about a year or so back, we met up and also shared a picture on Instagram.”

When questioned about Prachi’s career trajectory, which seemed to stall despite her promising start as a TV actress, Ram offered his insights. “I don’t know. She is another person who left television for films. But she left it for the right film because she left Kasamh Se for Rock On (2008) opposite Farhan Akhtar. Rock On became a hit. Nobody at that time… I could not point a finger at her and ask, ‘Prachi, what are you doing?’ Yes we had a superhit show but Rock On is a Farhan Akhtar film and she is playing his wife, opposite him. So it wasn’t a secondary role. So technically she didn’t do anything wrong. After that I don’t know what she did or didn’t do. You have to make the right choices. If you are lucky enough to get work then you have to make the right choices. If you make one wrong choice, maybe you are lucky enough to get a second chance. Make two wrong choices, ‘bye bye.’”","Ram Kapoor recently discussed his experience working with a 17-year-old Prachi Desai on the TV show *Kasamh Se* (2006), where he was in his 30s. He shared that despite the significant age gap, there was no awkwardness, as the story justified the casting. Ram also praised Prachi's acting talent and revealed they are still in touch. He reflected on her career choices, supporting her decision to leave television for the successful film *Rock On* (2008), but noted that career success relies on making the right choices.",Entertainment,86,469

As a result, even in his mid-50s, he remains as fit as ever. Recently, Rohit shared a personal anecdote that reaffirmed his pride in his disciplined lifestyle, recalling an experience in Ahmedabad where he encountered some old friends who were drunk, despite Gujarat being a dry state.

“My daughter told me, ‘Baba, you should be proud of how you look and tell them your real age. I used to hide it before,” he shared during a recent appearance on the Cyrus Says podcast. “I went for a reunion in Ahmedabad recently. I walked in not knowing what I was going to see: it had been 25-30 years. I stepped into a basement (at a friend’s place) with a half-km-long bar, in Ahmedabad where daaru (alcohol) is not allowed! I noticed that they all looked 70: somebody was bald, and somebody was fat. I love you guys, but still… Then we took a picture which I have at home and that keeps inspiring me,” he added.

During the chat, host and comedian Cyrus Broacha also shared how he embraced sobriety and his journey since then. “I don’t know anyone who is as obsessed as me with weight training. I don’t touch alcohol anymore either,” he said, prompting Rohit to ask about the decision. Cyrus revealed he quit alcohol on December 24, 2015.

“I got smashed on Christmas eve and ended up dancing with some stranger woman. My daughter was growing up and she said ‘Dad, stop it now. You coming drunk and mom locking you out of the room.’ What was charming in my 20s and 30s became ugly in my 40s and 50s,” he mentioned.

Cyrus then went one step further and made some distasteful remarks, almost suggesting that violence against women is a matter of pride as long as they are good-looking. Joking about the ‘consequences’ of drinking at an older age, he said, “You also end up chasing ugly women. I am not against chasing women, but don’t chase ugly women. People would say, ‘he’s in jail for molesting a really ugly woman.’ It’s horrible,” he ‘quipped’, drawing laughter from Rohit.

Sharing the reaction he often gets from his wife, actor Manasi Joshi Roy, Rohit said, “It has never happened that I have come back home after a nice happy evening with my boys and not get dagger looks from Manasi. I ask her, ‘What is it? Is it my health concern or are you just unhappy that I am happy?’ It has to be the latter because my health is fine. I drink once in a while.

He also recalled how his decision to pursue acting strained his relationship with his father, leading to a rift that lasted nearly a decade.

“I was a rich man’s only son and I grew up with a lot of privileges. But after school, I told him I didn’t want to run his company and that I wanted to make it on my own. So, I walked away from all those privileges to create my own path, which took me almost 10 years before I started getting regular work,” Kapoor said during a chat with Siddharth Kannan.

Kapoor shared that his interest in acting began during his teenage years, but his father did not take him seriously. “When I was 13-14, I told him I wanted to become an actor. He didn’t take me seriously, particularly since I was a little kid and he was a very big man. For him, his company was his legacy and everything and he wanted his only son to take it forward. So, when I said I didn’t want to take over his company, I understood what he must have gone through. Then I fled to America and joined the acting school of my choice. I graduated somehow, returned to India and started meeting people (for work). I had to prove, not only to my father but, to my entire family that I was going to do this. I knew everyone was waiting for me to fail because they thought that would bring me back to the ‘right track’,” he said.

Kapoor revealed that his father finally recognised his success when his employees began approaching him for photographs with the actor. “It took 10 years… Then the time came when people in his own office started approaching him asking their boss for photographs with his son. That’s when dad realised I had become something and that I wouldn’t return (to run the company). For 10 years, we didn’t speak much and then he slowly developed a respect for me. After he passed away, four years ago, I got to know from his partners, friends etc how much he respected me.”

Emphasising that accomplishments earned through struggle and hard work hold greater value, Kapoor also shared a personal anecdote about how his father initially believed he had fled to the US for only a few weeks. “He stopped talking to me and sending me money. I was in America on my own, making money for food and rent. I worked at Starbucks, sold second-hand vehicles etc. But, had that not happened, I wouldn’t have been the man I am today,” he added.","Ram Kapoor recently opened up about his early struggles, recalling how he grew up privileged as the son of the late Anil Kapoor, a successful ad guru and businessman.

Indian Express,2025-01-07 00:00:00,"‘Phenk mat’: Abhijeet claims he suggested Shah Rukh Khan’s singing portion in ‘I Am The Best’ song, Lalit Pandit declares it was SRK’s idea","Shah Rukh Khan has had many memorable songs in his nearly 33 year long film career and many of his songs in the 1990s were crooned by singer Abhijeet Bhattacharya. During a recent episode of Indian Idol, singer Abhijeet claimed that while recording the song “I Am The Best” for Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani, he came up with the idea that Shah Rukh should himself record the last bit of the song where he sings “Oh yes yes, sing it again.” As soon as Abhijeet claimed this as his idea, composer Lalit Pandit, who was also present on the show, said that this was actually Shah Rukh’s idea as he was present during the recording.

During the episode, Abhijeet performed the song with one of the contestants and then shared, “When we were recording it, I did a portion on top of the chorus where I said ‘Oh yeah, I am the best.’ Then I suggested to Lalit that Shah Rukh should do it. And within one hour, Shah Rukh was there and he did it.” Lalit laughed as soon as he heard this and said, “He has reversed the story now.”
Lalit Pandit, who composed the song with his brother Jatin Pandit, said that Shah Rukh Khan was present at the recording and insisted that he remembered each and every bit about recording his songs. Abhijeet was mildly offended by this and asked, “Maine phenka? (Did I lie?)” Lalit said that he was sharing the conversation that Shah Rukh had with him during the recording and Abhijeet, meanwhile, kept repeating, “It’s very embarrassing.”

Lalit then recalled that Shah Rukh wanted something extra in the last bit and after multiple attempts by Abhijeet, he offered to do it himself and did it in one take. “Shah Rukh kept saying ask him to do it in a certain way. Do you remember we had some problem in ‘I am the best’ portion? We kept rehearsing it more and more. Then Shah Rukh said ‘I will only do this last bit.’ So I said, ‘Yes please, go and do it’ and he did it in one take. He knew the style he wanted it in so it was simple for him. I guess, so he did it in one take,” he recalled.

He recalled reading in a book by Amitabh’s father, Harivansh Rai Bachchan, about the actor braving contaminated water during the shoot of his 1979 film Kaala Patthar. Kaushalendra also spoke about the senior Bachchan’s heartfelt wish for his son’s long life.

Kaushalendra, who hails from Dhanbad, Jharkhand, and works in the coal-buying sector, referenced the Chasnala mining disaster that inspired Kaala Patthar. He shared, “I remember that you shot for Kaala Patthar after the Jharia Chasnala disaster. The disaster happened due to a dam burst, and during the shoot, contaminated water was sprayed on you to recreate the scene.

However, the film, also starring Tabu, failed at the box office. Although his next movie, Raja, was scheduled for release three weeks later, due to the poor performance of his debut film, many believed his career was over even before it started. Raja director Indra Kumar believed that his career as a filmmaker too was over, now that his film was going to flop due to Sanjay Kapoor. However, it turned out to be a huge success.

Recalling the incident, Indra Kumar, who had delivered two successful films before Raja, told Siddharth Kannan, “After giving two successful films, I reshot Raja. When I watched the original film, I quiet didn’t understand certain scenes. I realised my mistake, so I rewrote the script and shot it again. That picture too went on to become a super hit.”

After this, let’s go to Haridwar.'” Explaining his state of mind, Indra Kumar who had just directed the third film of his career, shared, “Now my hero was Sanjay Kapoor, whose previous film flopped so everybody was talking about him. It could have had a bad impact on my film. I lost hope. But, thanks to my stars, and Madhuri Dixit, and Saroj Khan, and my writers, they all saved this film for me.”

Sharing his success moment, the filmmaker said, “When I was watching the movie in Novelty (theatre), the same people who were ridiculing Sanjay Kapoor for his previous film, were clapping for him on the scene where he slaps Madhuri Dixit.” The filmmaker smiled as he shared the incident. He proudly explained, “There is a scene where Madhuri Dixit accuses Sanjay Kapoor’s brother of harassing her, but he slaps her instead and takes his brother’s side. He refuses to believe her.

I say this to my son too, ‘It doesn’t matter how good you are as an actor, it all depends on your fate and stars. There is a reason certain actors are termed stars. It is because their stars favour them and make them successful. Sanjay Kapoor’s stars were not as powerful. According to me, he did great in movies like Raja. But, it didn’t work for him.”

Indian Express,2025-01-07 00:00:00,"5 political trends to watch out for in 2025: Future of Sangh-BJP ties, women voters to the Priyanka Gandhi factor","To foretell something in a rustic like India is a dangerous proposition. Nonetheless, final yr’s developments level to sure traits — I want to level to 5 — which will affect the nation’s trajectory in 2025.

In Delhi, each the Aam Aadmi Celebration (AAP) and the Congress have promised month-to-month allowances for ladies — the Arvind Kejriwal-led social gathering Rs 2,100 beneath the Mahila Samman Yojana and the grand previous social gathering Rs 2,500 beneath the Pyaari Didi Yojana — if they arrive to energy.

For a lot of ladies, receiving cash is empowering, rising their financial price and strengthening their sense of autonomy. Because of this, these ladies are able to vote even otherwise from their spouses. Political events view ladies as “labharthis (beneficiaries)” however even this has its limits.Girls are among the many few constituencies right now that lower throughout faith and caste affiliations. (Categorical file photograph by Pavan Khengre)

More and more, ladies will demand their due place beneath the solar and never simply be glad with “revdis”. Within the speedy run, ladies will likely be decisive in each the Delhi elections and in Bihar in direction of the tip of the yr. Girls performed a decisive function within the victories of each Arvind Kejriwal and Nitish Kumar in the previous couple of elections. They’re among the many few constituencies right now that lower throughout faith and caste affiliations.

2. The ‘D’ issue
Dalits have been a longtime vote financial institution of various events at varied instances. Of late, events, all the time fast to scent the course of the wind, have realised the rising, not diminishing, import of Babasaheb Ambedkar. BJP and Congress MPs even had a scuffle in Parliament over Ambedkar through the current Winter Session.

Each Modi and Chief of Opposition Rahul Gandhi will likely be anticipated to sharpen their pitch this yr to win over Dalits. The pace with which the group reacted within the Lok Sabha polls to the potential for the “400 paar” narrative ending reservation confirmed how well-networked younger and educated Dalits are right now. They had been instrumental in robbing the BJP of a transparent majority.

3. The Sangh-BJP relationship
The “S (Sangh)” issue will likely be watched with nice curiosity because the RSS centenary celebrations get underway and the powerplay within the bigger Hindutva household resets the BJP-RSS agenda.

A recalibration of the connection between the Sangh and the BJP might be on the playing cards in 2025 as they could face new challenges from inside the bigger Hindu ecosystem. Regardless of the Sangh’s reservation about “vyaktivaad (character cult)” — an allusion to the help Modi enjoys — it isn’t more likely to rock the Modi boat and do something that strengthens Gandhi.

However it want to make sure that personality-oriented politics doesn’t develop within the BJP anymore and the social gathering goes again to “collective management”. The number of the following BJP president will point out how a lot of the Sangh’s considerations the social gathering brass has been taken on board. Some have clearly been addressed because the RSS cadre put their finest foot ahead to make sure the BJP’s victory in Haryana and Maharashtra.

Mohan Bhagwat’s current assertion that the time had come to cease on the lookout for mandirs beneath each masjid took many unexpectedly. With Yogi Adityanath seeming to be fashioning a political line, and following, unbiased of the BJP and the Sangh, the sarsanghchalak was seen to be sending a sign to the Uttar Pradesh CM.

When PM Modi lately despatched a chadar for the shrine at Ajmer Sharif, he underlined a sentiment just like the one Bhagwat expressed. And each had been in sync with the Supreme Court docket’s course barring civil courts from registering recent fits difficult the possession and title of anywhere of worship or ordering surveys of disputed non secular locations till additional orders.

Nonetheless, Adityanath has saved citing the difficulty and the Akhil Bharatiya Sant Samiti, a physique of sants, has criticised Bhagwat for “interfering” in what was the dharmacharyas’ (non secular leaders) area. It’s unlikely that these sants or others within the Hindu Proper would communicate so forthrightly with out some political backing and that sign appears to be coming from Adityanath. The UP CM might need to leverage the unbiased following he has within the 2027 Meeting elections. As is well-known, he doesn’t come from the RSS stream however heads the well-known Gorakhnath Math in Gorakhpur.

4. What is going to regional events do?
Will or not it’s a yr of the regional events, of the “R” issue? A lot will depend upon how Kejriwal fares within the Delhi elections and what Nitish decides to do.

A fourth time period will make Kejriwal a severe nationwide participant who can’t be simply dismissed. That’s the reason each the BJP and the Congress need him to lose and each see him as enemy primary. His victory will increase Mamata Banerjee’s declare for the management of the INDIA bloc, placing the Congress at a drawback. Sharad Pawar and Lalu Prasad have additionally welcomed the thought of Banerjee within the lead function.

Once more, a lot will depend upon what Pawar’s Nationalist Congress Celebration (Sharadchandra Pawar) decides to do. Will it reunite with Ajit Pawar’s NCP? Talks are afoot to convey this about and it’ll naturally have implications for nationwide politics.

5. Will Priyanka have an effect?
Untimely although it’s to speak about this, the “P or Priyanka” issue will even be at play in 2025. Will there be a face-off with Modi? Going by her debut speech in Parliament and her potential to catch eyeballs, a lot will depend upon the function the Congress management assigns her.

Understanding her potential, the BJP has already initiated its counterattack. Its Wayanad candidate Navya Haridas has filed an election petition difficult Priyanka’s election and the matter is more likely to be taken up in January.

The yr guarantees to be removed from uneventful. However then once more, Indian politics is never boring. The Census is because of be held this yr and the federal government must take a name on whether or not to go forward with Rahul Gandhi’s demand for a caste census, bringing the controversial “C” issue to the centre stage.","Predicting India’s political future is challenging, yet recent trends suggest five key factors will shape 2025. First, women voters are emerging as a powerful constituency, with parties like AAP and Congress offering monthly allowances to woo them. However, women are demanding more than just benefits and are voting independently, influencing outcomes in Delhi and Bihar. Second, Dalits remain crucial to electoral success. Their strong response against the BJP's ""400 paar"" narrative highlights their growing political awareness and importance in upcoming campaigns by both BJP and Congress.

Third, the BJP-RSS relationship is under scrutiny as the RSS approaches its centenary. While the Sangh prefers collective leadership over personality-driven politics, it’s unlikely to directly challenge Modi. Recent statements by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and PM Modi suggest a more inclusive tone, potentially clashing with hardline elements like Yogi Adityanath. Fourth, regional parties could reshape the political landscape, depending on leaders like Kejriwal, Nitish Kumar, and Mamata Banerjee. AAP’s success may elevate Kejriwal’s national standing and impact the INDIA bloc’s leadership dynamics. Lastly, Priyanka Gandhi’s rise is being closely watched following her parliamentary debut. Her role in Congress and BJP’s response, including legal challenges, suggest she may become a significant player in the coming year.

Since the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan in 2021, female participation in sports has been effectively stopped, a move that directly puts the Afghanistan Cricket Board in contravention of International Cricket Council (ICC) rules.

The statement, addressed to ECB chief executive Richard Gould, concludes: “We strongly urge the England men's team players and officials to speak out against the horrific treatment of women and girls in Afghanistan under the Taliban.

“We also urge the ECB to consider a boycott of the upcoming match against Afghanistan... to send a clear signal that such grotesque abuses will not be tolerated.

Mint,2025-01-07 00:00:00,From Pierre to Justin: The Trudeaus troubled legacy in Indo-Canadian relations amidst Canada PMs resignation,"Justin Trudeau announced his desicion to resign as Prime Minister of Canada on 6 January, 2024. He asked Governor General of Canada to prorogue the Parliament till March 24. News reports have speculated that Justin Trudeau's diplomatic battle with India over Khalistan issue, that triggered with Hardeep Singh Nijjar killing, may have led to his declining popularity, which ultimately led to the resignation of the three term PM.
Catch LIVE Updates on Justin Trudeau resignation
On Monday, Trudeau said it had become clear to him that he cannot ""be the leader during the next elections due to internal battles. He planned to stay on as prime minister until a new leader of the Liberal Party is chosen.
I dont easily back down faced with a fight, especially a very important one for our party and the country. But I do this job because the interests of Canadians and the well being of democracy is something that I hold dear,"" he said.
Before Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, there was his father, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, who served as Canadas 15th Prime Minister.
In January 1971, Pierre Trudeau spent five days touring India. During his visit, he rode a camel, stroked a bullock, sailed on the Ganges, explored a locomotive factory, and admired the Taj Mahal. This account was shared by Gar Pardy, a Canadian Foreign Service officer who served in New Delhi at the time.
The bad blood in Indo-Canada ties, in fact, began with Pierre Trudeau, says a report by India Today.
The Khalistan Row: From Pierre to JustinThe diplomatic tensions between Canada and India regarding the Khalistan movement have deep roots, dating back to Pierre Trudeau's era. During the early 1980s, Canada government under Pierre Trudeau faced criticism for its handling of Khalistani separatists in Canada, with accusations of inaction despite rising militancy.
Pierre Trudeau's reluctance to confront these issues laid the groundwork for ongoing tensions. This issue resurfaced under Justin Trudeaus leadership, culminating in accusations against India regarding the assassination of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, further straining relations between the two nations.
The Kanishka Bombing: A Tragic LegacyOne of the most devastating consequences of the Pierre Trudeau government's handling of Khalistani extremism was the bombing of Air India Flight 182 in 1985.
Orchestrated by pro-Khalistan militants, the Kanishka tragedy resulted in the deaths of 329 passengers. Air India Flight 182 was a passenger flight operating on the MontrealLondonDelhiMumbai route, that on 23 June 1985, disintegrated over the Atlantic Ocean as a result of an explosion from a bomb allegedly planted by the militants.
The Nuclear Reactor Row: A Complicated HistoryAnother significant factor contributing to strained relations is the historical context surrounding nuclear cooperation. In 1974, India conducted its first nuclear test using plutonium from a reactor supplied by Canada.
This event prompted Pierre Trudeau's government to withdraw support for India's nuclear energy programme, leading to decades of strained ties over nuclear issues.
Although attempts at reconciliation were made with a Nuclear Cooperation Agreement in 2010, the legacy of mistrust remains a critical element in understanding the complexities of Indo-Canadian relations today.
Quebec: A Parallel ChallengeThe complexities of managing separatist sentiments are not unique to Canada-India relations; they also resonate within Canada itself, particularly regarding Quebec.
Historically, Pierre Trudeau's government grappled with the Quebec sovereignty movement, which sought greater autonomy or independence from Canada.
Pierre Trudeau's administration took a firm stance against Quebec separatism, especially during the October Crisis of 1970 when civil liberties were suspended to quell violent protests. Notably, Trudeau senior's this stance on separatists came in complete contrast to their handling of pro-Khalistan separatists.","Justin Trudeau announced his desicion to resign as Prime Minister of Canada on 6 January, 2024.

Indian Express,2025-01-07 00:00:00,Sivakarthikeyan reveals why he once considered quitting cinema; opens up about the hostility he faced from some quarters: ‘Only Ajith sir and Vikram sir…’,"While basking in the massive success of director Rajkumar Periasamy’s biographical war actioner Amaran, Sivakarthikeyan is equally thrilled about the promising projects on his horizon, including one each with directors AR Murugadoss and Sudha Kongara. An outsider who entered the world of cinema through television shows, Sivakarthikeyan initially played supporting roles before transitioning into lead characters and eventually becoming a crowd-puller. Today, he stands as one of the most promising actors in Tamil cinema, commanding a massive fan base. However, did you know that Sivakarthikeyan once considered quitting the industry altogether? Yes, you heard that right. The actor recently opened up about why he reached this decision three years ago and the reasons that ultimately made him stay.

“I never complain about this industry, even though a lot happens around me. I only have complaints about the people. I am still passionate and want to continue here, but I didn’t want my struggles to affect my family. They are living a normal, regular life. My pressures and financial struggles, why should they bother my wife, mom, in-laws or my kids? In that perspective, I said ‘Enough. For my passion, you all are adjusting. Let me live for you.’ I wasn’t sure what we would do next, but I trusted we’d figure it out. After all, I hold an MBA,” Sivakarthikeyan shared during a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter India.

Reflecting on how his wife Aarthi encouraged him to persevere, Sivakarthikeyan said, “She told me, ‘You didn’t have anything and you have come so far. In the last 20 years, after Ajith sir and Vikram sir, no outsider became big in this industry and you have achieved it. It’s not an easy thing. Don’t leave this.’ She said since they are enjoying the benefits (of his stardom), they can manage this (the negative aspects) too.”

The actor also opened up about the challenges he faced due to his success, including instances where people were openly hostile toward him. Reflecting on his experiences, he admitted that surviving in the industry has been incredibly difficult, particularly in the last five years. “Few in this industry were very much welcoming, seeing a common man entering and rising through the ranks, but a few other groups weren’t ok with it. They were like, ‘Why is he getting it? Who is he to get that?’ Many have asked me such questions to my face: ‘Who are you in this industry? what are you doing here?’ I faced that so many times. I just smile and move on, without even replying. I don’t even say ‘My success is the answer to them.’ No, my success is not for that. It is for my films’ teams who work 100 per cent, my fans who celebrate me irrespective of my movies’ results and those people who wish to become like me.”","Sivakarthikeyan, a self-made star in Tamil cinema, recently revealed he once considered quitting the industry three years ago due to financial struggles and its impact on his family.

The Hindu,2025-01-07 00:00:00,Contrived grievance: On the Tamil Nadu Governor,"It is regrettable that the customary address to the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly by the Governor in the beginning of a new year’s session is turning into an unsavoury event year after year. For the third consecutive year, Governor R.N. Ravi’s penchant for raking up a controversy has come to the fore. He left the Assembly without reading out the address, claiming that the national anthem and the Constitution of India had been insulted because the anthem was not played prior to the delivery of his speech. The State government maintains that the practice in the Assembly was to play the State’s invocation to Tamil before the address and the national anthem at the end of the Governor’s speech and that this had been conveyed to the Governor’s office. As in the previous years, Mr. Ravi has to bear much of the blame for the flagrant politicisation of the event. If he had such prior knowledge about the practice followed in the Assembly, his grievance comes across as a ruse to create a controversy and avoid performing his constitutional duty of propounding the government’s policy statement on the floor of the House. In 2023, Mr. Ravi had skipped portions of the address prepared by the State government, including a reference to the ‘Dravidian model of governance’ and some praise for the law and order situation in the State. Last year, he expressed his inability to read out the address, citing what he termed “misleading claims and facts” in it.","The controversy surrounding Governor R.N. Ravi's address to the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly has indeed become a recurring issue. For the third consecutive year, Governor Ravi has sparked controversy by leaving the Assembly without delivering his address, citing the absence of the national anthem before his speech as an insult to the Constitution and the national anthem2.

The State government maintains that the practice in the Assembly is to play the State’s invocation to Tamil before the address and the national anthem at the end of the Governor’s speech, a practice that was communicated to the Governor's office. This disagreement has led to accusations that Governor Ravi is politicizing the event and avoiding his constitutional duty to present the government's policy statement1.

While Kohli scored a hundred, Rohit endured a tough time with an average of just above six and had to drop himself from the final Test.

Baring his 100 not out in the first Test in Perth, Kohli was dismissed while chasing deliveries outside off-stump in his rest of eight innings on the tour. Rohit, after having missed the first Test, managed just 31 runs in the next three games. He himself stood down from the Sydney Test.

Due to the lack of sewage channels, residents have constructed soak pits to discharge sewage and wastewater. Several soak pits have become full and sewage is now flowing onto the road, which poses a health hazard.

There are 15 houses in two streets in Ramalingapuram. People complain that basic facilities including UGD, stormwater drains, and even roads have not been provided in the last three decades. The residents mainly demand UGD saying they are facing troubles in discharging waste water.

“Ramalingapuram has not had basic facilities like sewage channel for the last 30 years. Due to this, we have set up sewage tanks (soak pits) in front of every house to discharge sewage. However, since it is clay soil, the water absorption capacity of the soil is too low, due to which choke pits often fill up and the sewage flows onto the road. Hence we have to spend our own money up to Rs 4000 per month to clear the pits twice a month,” said M John Paul, who has been residing there for the last three years.


“Initially, I constructed the choke pit for six feet, but it overflowed within eight months. Hence I altered it with 12 feet. The individual houses manage the situation with a single soak pit. However, apartments or houses with multiple portions need to have additional choke pits and they must be cleared once in 15 days. Though there is a sewage channel within 100 metres of our area, neither the CCMC officials nor councillor G Gheetha of the DMK has taken action to address the issue,” said another resident requesting anonymity.

Gheetha said “We have tried several times to fix this problem. Engineers from CCMC and consultancies examined the area and declared there is no slope to drain the sewage. They also warned that setting up open sewer channels will result in stagnation. UGD is the only option.”

She added that there is not enough space to set up a common collection point to collect and discharge sewage. “I know that if this problem is not fixed, it will create a bad name for me. But the people there know we have been constantly trying to fix it. We will find a solution soon.”

When asked, the Commissioner of Coimbatore City Municipal Corporation M Sivaguru Prabakaran assured us to take action on the issue and collected the details about the location from TNIE.","Residents of Ramalingapuram, Coimbatore, demand a refund of 30 years' tax payments due to the lack of basic amenities like underground drainage (UGD).

Prominent names like Hansal Mehta and Sanjay Gupta openly criticised his remarks on X (formerly Twitter). Vamsi made the comment during a producers’ roundtable discussion with Boney Kapoor. In light of the backlash, Vamsi has now responded, apologizing for his words and clarifying his stance, while also calling filmmaker and producer Karan Johar his inspiration.

In an interview with Telugu36, Vamsi expressed regret, saying, “If they really believe I disrespected Boney, I am sorry. I never wanted to disrespect anyone, especially Bollywood. As a south Indian, I was just proud of the kind of work we have done post-COVID.”
Sharing how Karan Johar has inspired him to become a filmmaker, he said, “I adore Shah Rukh Khan, Ranbir Kapoor, and even Deepika Padukone. Karan Johar is my inspiration for coming to films, not any Telugu director. Ever since I watched Kuch Kuch Hota Hain, I knew I wanted to make a rich-looking film like that someday.”

Vamsi also explained that his original comments stemmed from the impressive success of South Indian films in recent years, which he is particularly proud of. He cited examples of SS Rajamouli’s RRR and Baahubali, Prashanth Neel’s KGF, Rishab Shetty’s Kantara, Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s Animal and Atlee’s Jawan. “Because south Indians made all these films, as a south Indian talking to someone from the north, I just pointed out how well we performed.”

He also confirmed that him and Boney were cordial after interview. “Boney Kapoor and I were fine after the interview. Now, Pushpa 2 generated records no Hindi film did to date, of course, I will be proud of it. It’s not arrogance,” he shared.

At the Galatta Plus roundtable, while speaking to Boney Kapoor, Vamsi had commented, “We, South Indians, have changed the way you (Bollywood) look at cinema.

The New Indian Express,2025-01-07 00:00:00,"Tiruchy corporation lost about Rs 7 crore clearing airport waste, shows RTI data","TIRUCHY: The Airports Authority of India recently spent roughly Rs 1,200 crore for the construction of the new terminal of Tiruchy International Airport. But even while spending such a huge amount, it was passing the buck of its garbage burden to the Tiruchy airport without paying a single penny.

The RTI filed by The New Indian Express also confirmed that the airport was violating the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, (SWM 2016) of the Government of India, over these years and had not paid any money for disposal of its waste. Highly placed sources said the Tiruchy Corporation over the years lost (from 2017 onwards) about Rs 7 crore due to this mismanagement.

According to SWM 2016, an entity generating over 100 kg of waste per day must establish its own recycling facility. Responding to the RTI filed by TNIE, Airport Director and Public Information Officer G Gopalakrishnan said, ""Tiruchy airport roughly generates about 750 kg of waste per day. As a stopgap arrangement, the waste is presently being cleared by the Tiruchy Corporation."" The director added that the airport would soon start the operation of a solid waste plant that can handle 1 tonne of waste per day.

To the RTI query, ""If the Tiruchy Airport is giving waste to Tiruchy City Corporation, how much money is it paying per month or year,"" the airport director simply said 'NIL.' Although TNIE asked in its RTI whether the airport got any exception under SWM 2016 for passing the waste to Tiruchy Corporation, the airport director was unable to point out any such exceptions.

Highly placed sources in the corporation said that the Tiruchy Corporation, from 2017 onwards, insisted the airport establish a solid waste management system, and the airport keeps on pushing this matter, citing various excuses. ""It is a major transport location and an iconic spot in the city. Thus, the corporation avoided taking action on the airport,"" a source said. This broad-mindedness of the local body compelled it to take the waste burden of the airport at a heavy loss.

All these are happening when the city civic body ensures that even a small tea stall pays the tax for solid waste management or Street Waste Management User (SUC) charges. Ironically, the Tiruchy airport is one of the most profitable airports in the country, recording a profit of about Rs 50 crore in the 2023-24 financial year. But instead of levying tax on such profit-making entities, the local body condoned its solid waste management violations.

When TNIE raised this issue with Tiruchy Corporation Commissioner V Saravanan, he said, ""I have considered this issue and decided to impose over Rs 1 crore per annum for collecting waste from Tiruchy airport.""","Tiruchy International Airport, generating 750 kg of waste daily, has violated Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, by offloading its waste burden onto Tiruchy Corporation without payment since 2017, causing a ₹7 crore loss.

Entrepreneur Karishma Kewalramani’s pitch for her inclusive beauty brand FAE Beauty fell in the latter category. Each of the five ‘sharks’ on the panel – Anupam Mittal, Aman Gupta, Namita Thapar, Vineeta Singh and Peyush Bansal – were impressed with Karishma’s tenacity and values as an entrepreneur. Aman even seemed to flirt with her, when she mentioned that she worked as a makeup artist on film and TV sets after returning from the US. “You didn’t work at Shark Tank?” he asked with a smile.

Karishma asked for Rs 1 crore in funding in exchange of 1% equity, valuing her company at Rs 100 crore. But, she revealed that because of previous rounds of funding, she had diluted her equity to 38%. Karishma’s dedication to keeping her company running at the cost of further dilution impressed Peyush. But Namita wanted to know how she would compete with foreign brands such as Estée Lauder, which is launching a more affordable range of products for the Indian market. “Pehle toh main darti nahi hoon (Firstly, I am not scared),” Karishma said, leaving the ‘sharks’ impressed. Vineeta, who operates a successful cosmetics brand herself, said that she is aware of Karishma’s company, and is impressed by their packaging and branding.

But she was the only ‘shark’ to not make her an offer, saying that it doesn’t make sense for her to invest in the company for such low equity. But that didn’t stop the remaining four ‘sharks’ from engaging in a bidding war. Aman and Namita joined hands, and offered Karishma Rs 1 crore for 3% equity, which Peyush matched. Anupam, on the other hand, offered Rs 1 crore in exchange of 3.3% equity. Karishma was torn, because all three offers were similar. But she countered by asking for Rs 1 crore in exchange of 1.3%, because she didn’t want to dilute herself further. Karishma said that four four years, she suffered immense losses, but things turned around last year, when she became profitable for the first time. She took FAE from registering losses as high as Rs 2.5 crore in one year to generating Rs 1.2 crore in profits.

After some further negotiations, Karishma agreed to Aman and Namita’s offer, and the deal was finalised at Rs 1 crore in exchange of 1.5% equity. In her post-pitch interview, Karishma spoke about the massive losses that she was bearing, and said that for the first time, she is in profit.

His rise from a comedy show contestant to a TV host to a hero’s sidekick to a hero, and now a bonafide superstar is a journey that many would appreciate, and many more would love to emulate. But what really stands him apart is his clarity on the kind of films he wants to do, and the measured moves he takes to achieve the vision in his head. Understanding the various stakeholders of cinema has been one of his strengths that has endeared him to not just the masses but many cinema insiders too. Probably why, when Prince, his 2023 film with director Anudeep, didn’t perform as expected in Tamil Nadu, he paid money to distributors who incurred losses.

“I have to take responsibility for my failures. It is important to understand what went wrong,” said Sivakarthikeyan, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter.

Calling success as a combined effort but a failure as a lone burden to bear, Sivakarthikeyan said, “I haven’t done remakes in my career. So, I personally listen to every script before doing the film. We believe it would do well, but sometimes, it doesn’t. So, I am responsible for those choices.” Drilling home the point that it is important for an actor to understand the results of their films, Sivakarthikeyan also added that it doesn’t mean he wants to be comfortable with the results. “If that’s the case, I’d opt for remakes, right? They are films that worked somewhere else, and it becomes an exercise in replicating success. But I prefer learning the process of saying yes to a script, understanding what works or didn’t, and then seeing how it pans out.”

Even in the case of Prince, which was director Anudeep’s followup to his super successful debut, Jathi Rathnalu, Sivakarthikeyan asserted that the film’s biggest problem was the hero. “Prince was not Anudeep’s mistake. It would have done really well with another hero. In fact, it did really well in Telugu too. Of course, there are some flaws in the script, but the decision and responsibility is completely mine. That is why I gave an amount to the producer to pay back the distributors. Some might say it isn’t the right working practice, but I feel responsible,” said Sivakarthikeyan.

However, this magnanimity doesn’t come at the cost of not enjoying the success of his planning and hard work. “While I do understand that success is a collective effort, I don’t stop myself from enjoying my success. I accept responsibility for my failures, right? So, I have all the rights to enjoy success,” said the Doctor actor, who pointed out how many on social media have no qualms hating on him for the failures, but refrain from crediting him for his film’s success. ‘I am not okay with it,” said Sivakarthikeyan, pointing out this to be one of the reasons for him staying away from social media. “It was affecting me. It gives the illusion that everyone is against you. I just switched it off, did my work, and I’m seeing the result. Also, information reaches us even if we are not on social media, so why should I use it more often?”

The New Indian Express,2025-01-07 00:00:00,"Seven months on, Dharmapuri Railway junction makeover on slow track","DHARMAPURI: Seven months have passed since the South Western Railway announced that Dharmapuri Junction would be developed under the Amrit Bharat Sagar Scheme at the cost of `23 crore. But there has been no progress in the work since then.

The Dharmapuri railway junction is one of the most crucial transit points in the South Western railway divisions in Tamil Nadu with over 40 trains passing through it. However, the last time the Dharmapuri railway junction received an upgrade was two decades ago in 2004.

So, last year when the SW railway announced the ABSS scheme for Dharmapuri, passengers received it cheerful unmindful of the inconvenience it would pose in the short term. However. Six months after the foundation work was undertaken, no other progress has been made to date.

S Mathialagan, district secretary of the railway passenger social welfare association, said, “ The South Western Railway has ignored development works in Tamil Nadu for a long period. Be it the Morappur - Dharmapuri railway line or tracks doubling between Royakottai and Omalur, all schemes are being delayed. The ABSS was crucial to improve amenities in 13 aspects of the Dharmapuri junction but funds have not been allocated due to which works are delayed.”

S Kumaresan, a resident of Elakkiyampatti, said, “ Now there is no parking space available, with Pongal round the corner, families would arrive to depart for their native places. So a large number of vehicles will come here in the upcoming days. But there is only a huge pit. It has been the case for the past 6 months. The SW railway was supposed to construct a parking and reception area. The delay is causing inconvenience.”

When TNIE spoke to officials in the Dharmapuri junction, they said, “ Many developmental works are being undertaken by the SW railway including the construction of the Morappur Railway junction. Further, tracks are being replaced between Royakottai and Omalur. The SW railway is taking steps to improve the experiences of passengers. Similarly, the Dharmapuri junction will also be constructed, funds will be allocated soon.”","Development of Dharmapuri Junction under the ₹23 crore Amrit Bharat Sagar Scheme remains stalled seven months after its announcement. Passengers face inconvenience due to incomplete amenities like parking. Officials cite concurrent projects, such as Morappur junction construction and track replacement, but delays persist as funds for Dharmapuri are yet to be allocated.",Local News,52,344

S Muthukumar, an advocate from Madurai, stated in his petition that there are 15 government law colleges functioning under the control of Tamil Nadu Dr Ambedkar Law University. The said university, located in Chennai, also established the above law school in its campus in 2002. The SOEL has been modelled on the national law schools in the country and has expert faculty of international quality, Muthukumar said.

However, the students from southern districts of Tamil Nadu are finding it difficult to study in SOEL due to its location in the state capital, as they would have to spend a considerable amount of money towards travel expenses, he claimed, and requested the court to direct the government to establish a similar law school in Madurai.

A bench comprising Justices MS Ramesh and AD Maria Clete directed the authorities to file a counter affidavit and adjourned the case.","The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court sought the state government's response to a PIL seeking the establishment of a law school in Madurai, akin to Chennai's School of Excellence in Law (SOEL).

The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 3% in January 2025 compared to the same month last year, slightly up from 2.9% in December 2024. This signals that inflation remains a concern for policymakers and consumers alike. The rise in prices is affecting daily expenses, from groceries to gas, making it crucial to understand what’s driving this trend and how it impacts the broader economy.Energy costs played a major role in pushing inflation higher, with gas and fuel prices accounting for 40% of the overall monthly increase. Rising global oil prices and supply chain disruptions have driven up costs.Essential food items such as meat and eggs remained expensive due to ongoing supply issues, including adverse weather conditions and disease outbreaks in livestock. Food inflation continues to put pressure on household budgets.The U.S. government has imposed new tariffs on imported goods, particularly from China, raising concerns about further inflation. These tariffs increase production costs for businesses, which then pass the burden onto consumers.The housing sector remains under pressure, with rental costs increasing by 5.2% year-over-year. Higher interest rates have slowed down new housing construction, leading to a supply-demand gap.The Federal Reserve had recently lowered its benchmark interest rate to 4.3%, aiming to balance economic growth and inflation control. However, with inflation still above the Fed’s 2% target, further rate cuts may be delayed.: The stock market responded negatively to the CPI data. Dow Jones Futures dropped by 425 points (1%), while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 fell by 1.1% and 1.2%, respectively. Investors are now uncertain about future monetary policies.With prices continuing to rise, consumers are cutting back on discretionary spending. Retail sales have shown slower growth, and many households are prioritizing essential goods over luxury purchases.Economists are closely watching upcoming economic data to gauge whether inflation will slow down in the coming months. The combination of higher energy costs, food prices, and new tariffs could keep inflation elevated for longer than expected. If inflation doesn’t ease, the Federal Reserve may have to reconsider its interest rate strategy to stabilize the economy.Due to higher energy prices, food costs, and new import tariffs.The Dow Jones fell 425 points, and S&P 500 and Nasdaq also declined.","US inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), climbed to 3% in January 2025, a slight increase from December, signaling persistent price concerns. This rise is largely attributed to a 40% jump in energy costs due to global oil prices and supply chain issues. Essential food items like meat and eggs also remain expensive because of ongoing supply problems. New government tariffs on imported goods, especially from China, are further contributing to production costs. Additionally, housing rental costs have increased significantly.

The New Indian Express,2025-01-07 00:00:00,"Delhi Election 2025: Voting in single phase on February 5, counting on 8th","The Election Commission on Tuesday announced the dates for Delhi Assembly elections.

The elections are scheduled to happen in single phase on February 5. Votes will be counted and the results declared on February 8.

The election process will be completed before February 10, the Commission said.

The last date to submit nominations will be January 17 and the scrutiny of nominations will be done by January 18. Candidates will be able to withdraw their nominations till January 20.

With the announcement of the date of elections, Model Code of Conduct has come into force in the national capital.

The term of Delhi's 70-member Assembly ends on February 23. Delhi has traditionally seen assembly polls in a single phase.

""It is a single-phase election. We have deliberately kept polling on a Wednesday so more people come out to vote, like we did in Maharashtra,"" Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar said at a press conference.

Of the 70 seats in Delhi, 58 are general and 12 reserved.

According to the electoral roll, Delhi has 1. 55 crore voters -- 83. 49 lakh men, 71. 74 lakh women and 1,261 transgender persons.

There are 25. 89 lakh young voters, 2. 08 lakh first-time voters, and 830 above the age of 100.

More than 13,000 polling stations will be set up in Delhi, the CEC informed.

Bypolls to two assembly constituencies -- Milkipur in Uttar Pradesh and Erode in Tamil Nadu -- will also be held according to the same schedule.

In the 2020 polls, AAP won 62 seats and the BJP eight while the Congress drew a blank.

The ruling Aam Admi Party (AAP) headed by former chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is pushing for a third consecutive term in power while the BJP, which managed to make a mark in the Lok Sabha elections, is all set to nab the capital city.

The Congress is also another key player in the game. The grand old party is contesting alone in the upcoming elections, taking on both BJP and AAP, its alliance partner in the Lok Sabha polls.

Asserting that his party will form government in Delhi, AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said the Delhi Assembly polls will be a contest between the ""politics of work and politics of abuse.""

""This election will be between the politics of work and the politics of abuse. The people of Delhi will have faith in our politics of work. We will definitely win,"" Kejriwal said on X.

Kejriwal and AAP leaders have been accusing the BJP of hurling abuses and trying to win the elections without having any chief ministerial candidate and issues.

In an apparent blow to the BJP-led NDA government, the Election Commission informed that no Delhi-specific provision can be made in the Union Budget that can disturb the level-playing field.

Responding to a query about the the Union Budget, scheduled days ahead of the polls, Kumar said, ""We will write to the cabinet secretary that no Delhi-specific provision can be made in the Union Budget that can disturb the level-playing field.""

Urging political parties to maintain decorum during elections, CEC said that the commission would conduct checks to ensure free and fair polls.

""We will check everyone for ensuring money-free elections. During recent polls, there was a hue and cry that some helicopters were checked. People even come down to threatening polling officers but we control ourselves because it disturbs the level playing field,"" Kumar said.

""The star campaigners and those in political campaigns are duty-bound to ensure that etiquette is followed... We will be very harsh. Star campaigners should not act in a way that discourages common voters,"" he said.

District magistrates and returning officers will ensure fair play and a level playing field for every candidate, he added.

""We will also request the political parties not to create undue pressure on the officials,"" Kumar said and added that the parties could ask for any explanation in writing.

Kumar also cautioned the political parties not to cross certain lines while campaigning, stating that polarisation during poll campaigns can leave scars that may last forever.

""World over, if you look at democracies, words like 'democratic backsliding', 'democratic recession' are being used. Country after country, you can see what is happening,"" he said.

The campaign period is becoming so polarised in one country after another that the scars created during that time do not fade even during non-campaign periods, he added.

""Therefore, it is extremely necessary that campaigns are regulated, political parties also become sensitive and responsive, not cross lines which are being crossed the world over,"" Kumar said.","The Delhi Assembly elections will be held on February 5, with results announced on February 8. The Model Code of Conduct is in effect. AAP seeks a third term, BJP targets the capital, and Congress contests solo.

The New Indian Express,2025-01-07 00:00:00,Boost your Colon health after festive feasts: Essential foods for better digestion,"The festive season brings joy, celebrations, and indulgent meals. While this is delightful, many people feel sluggish and uncomfortable afterward. The reason? Overloading the gut, especially the colon, with foods that slow digestion and increase toxicity. The colon, or the large intestine, plays a crucial role in processing waste and preparing it for elimination.

It’s also responsible for absorbing electrolytes, and some vitamins from the leftover food material. The colon houses billions of bacteria, collectively known as the gut microbiome, which aid digestion, produce certain vitamins, and protect against harmful pathogens. A healthy colon ensures smooth digestion and overall well-being.

Festive eating often involves low-fiber, high-fat, and heavily processed foods, which can harm your colon in several ways. Processed and fatty foods slow down digestion, increasing the time food stays in the colon. This can lead to decay, fermentation, and toxin buildup. Over time, these issues can compromise colon health, causing inflammation, toxicity, and even chronic conditions. Incorporate these into your diet to counteract the effects of festive indulgence:

Fiber also called the natural broom is essential for a healthy colon because it helps in sweeping away waste and toxins. It also absorbs water, softening stools and promoting regular bowel movements. There are 2 types of fibre: Soluble fibre found in oats, flaxseeds, psyllium husks, beans, rice, barley, apples etc dissolves in water, forming a gel-like substance that promotes healthy digestion.

It feeds beneficial gut bacteria, reducing inflammation and supporting colon health. Soluble fiber also softens stools, easing their passage and preventing constipation. And the insoluble fibre found in whole wheat, rye, brown rice, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts etc adds bulk to stool, promoting regular bowel movements, and preventing constipation.
Probiotics are the gut’s best friend, these are live bacteria that keep your colon healthy, they help improve digestion, prevent harmful bacteria from growing, and support your immune system. Foods like yogurt, kefir, miso, sauerkraut, and kombucha etc are rich in probiotics. Prebiotics too are important for good health because they are food for the good bacteria in your gut. Foods like garlic, onions, bananas, and oats are rich in prebiotics and essential for gut health.

Leafy greens like spinach, kale, wheatgrass, barley grass, etc are good for your gut. They are rich in chlorophyll, which help cleanse the colon by removing toxins and promoting healthy digestion. Chlorophyll improves oxygen flow in the gut, reduces harmful bacteria, and supports the growth of good bacteria. These greens also provide fiber, which aids in bowel movements and prevents waste build-up.

Avocado is rich in omega-3 fatty acids that lubricates the colon walls, preventing toxins from sticking and aiding smooth elimination. The fiber promotes smooth digestion and regular bowel movements. Enjoy sourdough toast with guacamole or add avocado in the salad to get maximum benefits.

Include ginger and garlic in everyday meals because garlic’s antibacterial, antiviral, and antiparasitic properties help remove toxins, pathogens, and parasites from the digestive tract. Garlic also supports the growth of good gut bacteria, reduces inflammation, and prevents toxin build-up. Ginger, on the other hand, contains gingerol, which kills harmful bacteria and parasites.

Water is essential for keeping the colon healthy because it helps soften stool, making it easier to pass. It also aids in flushing out waste and toxins from the body. When you stay hydrated, your colon can absorb the right amount of water, preventing constipation and promoting regular bowel movements.","Festive indulgence can harm colon health by slowing digestion and increasing toxin buildup. To counteract this, include fiber-rich foods, probiotics, prebiotics, leafy greens, avocado, ginger, garlic, and water in your diet. These support digestion, promote regular bowel movements, reduce inflammation, and cleanse the colon, ensuring overall gut health and well-being.",Lifestyle and Features,50,566
