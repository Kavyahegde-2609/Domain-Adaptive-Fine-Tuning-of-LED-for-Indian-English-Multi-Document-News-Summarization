The Hindu,2024-06-29 00:00:00,"Delhi man falls prey to dating scam, ₹1.21 lakh extorted from him","A man was threatened, confined, and forced to pay a bill of ₹ 1.21 lakh as part of a dating scam, after a woman he met on a dating app took him to a cafe in East Delhi’s Vikas Marg to celebrate her birthday, the police said.

The police have arrested the cafe owners, the woman and another man in connection with the incident and a case of cheating and criminal conspiracy has been registered against all the accused, they added.

According to the victim’s complaint, on June 23, he met his date Versha, who took him to Black Mirror Cafe, where they had food, cakes, and fruit wine. When she left abruptly citing a family emergency, he was handed a bill of ₹1.21 lakhs. The woman, Versha, is a resident of Krishna Nagar and is suspected to have scammed others by using multiple aliases, the police said. She lives with Aryan, 25, who is unemployed and is an accused in the case. Another accused has been identified as Akshay Pahwa, 32, a resident of Shahdara, and one of the owners of Black Mirror Cafe. The other owners are Vansh Pahwa, Akshay’s cousin, and Ansh Grover, their friend.

When the woman left, it was the cafe owner who handed the victim the bill, the police said. “When he disputed the bill, he was threatened, confined, forced to make an online payment. Later, he understood he was scammed, so he reported the matter to the local police,” DCP (East) Apoorva Gupta said. Investigations revealed that the money was transferred to Mr. Pahwa’s bank account. The cafe also employed Digranshu as their manager, who is an acquaintance of Aryan.

The alleged bill at Black Mirror Cafe was divided in a fixed ratio — 15% goes to the woman, 45% is divided between the cafe manager and Aryan, and the remaining 40% goes to the owners, the police said. “Several such schemes operate in major metro cities like Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad, to extort money from innocent victims. The modus operandi involves collusion between cafe owners, managers, and individuals who trap victims through dating apps. There is a social stigma attached to such incidents which often prevents victims from reporting them,” the DCP said.

","In East Delhi, a man fell victim to a dating scam orchestrated by a woman he met on a dating app. After celebrating her birthday at Black Mirror Cafe, he was presented with a ₹1.21 lakh bill and coerced into paying it. The cafe owners, the woman, and an accomplice were arrested for cheating and criminal conspiracy. The scam involved multiple aliases and collusion between cafe staff and individuals to extort money from victims through dating apps.",Crime and Justice,77,372

The Hindu,2024-06-29 00:00:00,Joe Biden concedes debate fumbles but declares he will defend democracy,"President Joe Biden forcefully tried on Friday to quell Democratic anxieties over his unsteady showing in his debate with former President Donald Trump, as elected members of his party closed ranks around him in an effort to shut down talk of replacing him atop the ticket.

Mr. Biden's halting delivery and meandering comments, particularly early in the debate, fueled concerns from even members of his own party that at age 81 he's not up for the task of leading the country for another four years. It created a crisis moment for Biden’s campaign and his presidency, as members of his party flirted with potential replacements and donors and supporters couldn’t contain their concern about his showing against Mr. Trump.

 U.S. Presidential debate: Joe Biden falters in fiery debate with Donald Trump

Mr. Biden appeared to acknowledge the criticism during a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, saying ”I don’t debate as well as I used to.” But he added, “I know how to do this job. I know how to get things done.” Speaking for 18 minutes, Biden appeared far more animated than his showing the night before, and he excoriated Mr. Trump for his “lies” and campaign aimed at “revenge and retribution.”

“The choice in this election is simple,” Mr. Biden said. “Donald Trump will destroy our democracy. I will defend it.”

He added, alluding to his candidacy, “When you get knocked down, you get back up.”

Even before the debate, Mr. Biden's age had been a liability with voters, and Thursday night’s faceoff appeared to reinforce the public’s deep-seated concerns before perhaps the largest audience he will garner in the four months until Election Day.

 Trump turns 78, spotlighting age as central issue in 2024 race

Privately, his campaign had spent the previous hours working to tamp down concerns and keep donors and surrogates on board. Democratic lawmakers on Friday acknowledged Mr. Biden's poor showing, but tried to stop talk of replacing him as their standard-bearer, and instead tried to shift the focus onto Mr. Trump's attacks and falsehoods that they hoped would remind voters of the daily turbulence of his presidency.

“Well, the president didn’t have a good night, but neither did Donald Trump with lie after lie and his dark vision for America,” North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper told The Associated Press on Friday, hours before he introduced the president in Raleigh. “We cannot send Donald Trump back to the White House. He’s an existential threat to our nation.""

Former President Barack Obama backed up his former vice president, posting on X that “Bad debate nights happen."" Alluding to his own poor showing in the first debate of his reelection campaign in 2012, Obama continued, “Trust me, I know. But this election is still a choice between someone who has fought for ordinary folks his entire life and someone who only cares about himself.”

He added: “Last night didn’t change that, and it’s why so much is at stake in November.”

House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries answered with a flat “no” when asked Friday if Mr. Biden should step aside.

Rep. Ritchie Torres, Democrat of New York, said, “Since performance last night, I had to take a few more antidepressants than usual.”

“People have asked me, ‘Do I feel comfortable with the debate?’ You know, a Donald Trump presidency would cause me far greater discomfort than a Joe Biden debate performance.”

Mr. Biden's campaign billed the Raleigh event as the largest-yet rally of his reelection bid in the state Mr. Trump carried by the narrowest margin in 2020. He'll then travel to New York for a weekend of big-dollar fundraisers that his campaign now needs more than ever, as it looks to stave off Mr. Trump.

Mr. Biden's campaign announced that it raised $14 million on debate day and the morning after, while Mr. Trump's campaign said it raised more than $8 million from the start of the debate through the end of the night.

Vice President Kamala Harris, whom the Mr. Biden campaign sent out to defend his performance, was set to travel to Las Vegas, Nevada. She told CNN hours after the debate, “There was a slow start, but it was a strong finish.""

Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., said he could hardly sleep because of the number of telephone calls he got after Mr. Biden performed “horribly” in the debate.

“People were just concerned. And I told everybody being concerned is healthy, overreacting is dangerous,” Cleaver said. “And I think I wouldn’t advise anybody to make rash decisions right now.”

Rep. James Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat who was formerly a longtime fixture in House Democratic leadership, said he would likely speak to Mr. Biden later Friday and his message would be simple: “Stay the course.”

Mr. Biden and his allies were looking to brush aside concerns about his delivery to keep the focus on the choice for voters this November. They seized on Mr. Trump’s equivocations on whether he would accept the will of voters this time around, his refusal to condemn the rioters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, trying to overturn his 2020 loss to Biden, and his embrace of the conservative-leaning Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade that had legalized abortion nationwide.

But Mr. Biden fumbled on abortion rights, one of the most important issues for Democrats in this year’s election. He was unable to explain Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. A conservative Supreme Court with three justices nominated by Mr. Trump overturned Roe two years ago.

As elected Democrats united behind Mr. Biden publicly, donors and party operatives shared panicked text messages and phone calls Thursday night and into Friday expressing their concern that Mr. Biden’s performance was so bad that he may be unelectable this fall.

But there were no immediate signs of organized efforts among donors, his campaign leadership or the Democratic National Committee to convince the president to step aside, according to interviews with several people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share sensitive conversations.

Still, morale was poor among some Biden campaign staffers across the country, who had been encouraged by top campaign officials in Delaware to organize hundreds of debate watch parties to get as many eyes as possible on the Biden-Trump showdown. The morning after, some embarrassed lower-level campaign staffers privately expressed their desire for Biden to quit the race.

It was the same among some top Democratic donors in New York, southern California and Silicon Valley, who talked up the need to embrace a Biden replacement during a series of text chains and private conversations. There were informal conversations between donors and those close to potential Biden alternatives to gauge their willingness to step into the race. But there was no sense that a sitting governor or member of Congress would be willing to risk the political fallout that might come with a public break from the Democratic president.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat frequently mentioned as a 2028 contender and speculated about as a potential replacement for Mr. Biden on the ticket should he step aside, released a statement backing him on Friday.

“The difference between Joe Biden’s vision for making sure everyone in America has a fair shot and Donald Trump’s dangerous, self-serving plans will only get sharper as we head toward November,” she said.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom also dismissed questions on whether he would consider stepping in for Mr. Biden, telling reporters after the debate, “I will never turn my back on him.”

Under current Democratic Party rules, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to replace Mr. Biden as the party’s nominee without his cooperation or without party officials being willing to rewrite the rules at the August national convention.

Mr. Trump, meanwhile, flew to his golf club in Virginia, a onetime battleground that has shifted toward Democrats in recent years but that his aides believe can flip toward the Republican in November. He was set to hold at rally in Chesapeake Friday afternoon.","President Joe Biden faced criticism for his debate performance against former President Donald Trump, leading to concerns within the Democratic Party about his electability. Despite this, Democratic leaders and allies rallied behind Biden, emphasizing the stakes of the election and criticizing Trump's record. Efforts to replace Biden were discussed among donors and party operatives but no organized movement emerged. Biden's campaign emphasized the contrast with Trump on issues like abortion rights and voter integrity, seeking to maintain focus on the election ahead.",International News,82,1339
The Hindu,2024-06-29 00:00:00,"Supreme Court makes it harder to charge Capitol riot defendants with obstruction, charge Trump faces","The Supreme Court on Friday limited a federal obstruction law that has been used to charge hundreds of Capitol riot defendants as well as former President Donald Trump.

The justices ruled 6-3 that the charge of obstructing an official proceeding, enacted in 2002 in response to the financial scandal that brought down Enron Corp., must include proof that defendants tried to tamper with or destroy documents. Only some of the people who violently attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, fall into that category.

Also read: U.S. Capitol | The siege of a historical power centre

The overwhelming majority of the approximately 1,000 people who have been convicted of or pleaded guilty to Capitol riot-related federal crimes were not charged with obstruction and will not be affected by the outcome.

Still, the decision is likely to be used as fodder for claims by Mr. Trump and his Republican allies that the Justice Department has treated the Capitol riot defendants unfairly.

It's unclear how the court's decision will affect the case against Mr. Trump in Washington, which includes charges other than obstruction. Special counsel Jack Smith has said the charges faced by the former president would not be affected.

Mr. Trump's case is on hold while the Supreme Court considers a separate case in which Mr. Trump is claiming immunity from prosecution. A decision is expected on Monday.

Under the ruling issued Friday, dozens of defendants could seek new sentences, ask to withdraw guilty pleas, or have charges dropped. Most defendants convicted of obstruction were also convicted of another felony so their sentence may not be significantly impacted - if at all.

The high court returned the case of former Pennsylvania police officer Joseph Fischer to a lower court to determine if Fischer can be charged with obstruction. Fischer has been indicted for his role in disrupting Congress’ certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential election victory over Mr. Trump.

Fischer is among about 350 people who have been charged with obstruction. Some pleaded guilty to — or were convicted of — lesser charges.

Republicans, who have cast the Jan. 6 defendants as victims of political persecution, are certain to seize on the ruling to argue the rioters have been unfairly prosecuted by the Justice Department. Mr. Trump has embraced Jan. 6 defendants on the campaign trial, and floated pardons for the rioters if he wins in November.

Mr. Trump posted on his Truth Social platform shortly after the decision, calling the ruling “Big News!” He shared another message that described the ruling as a “massive victory” for “J6 political prisoners.”

It’s also likely to slow down cases in a court already clogged with Jan. 6 defendants as judges are forced to grapple with how to apply the ruling.

“It’s going to be a big mess,” said Randall Eliason, a professor at George Washington University Law School and former federal prosecutor in Washington.

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the court's opinion, joined by conservative Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas, and by liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, a former federal public defender who also wrote a separate opinion.

Reading the obstruction statute broadly ""would also criminalize a broad swath of prosaic conduct, exposing activists and lobbyists to decades in prison,” Roberts wrote.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett dissented, along with Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor.

Barrett, one of three justices appointed by Mr. Trump, wrote that the law clearly encompasses the events of Jan. 6. “The riot forced Congress to suspend the proceeding, delaying it for several hours,” she wrote.

She said her colleagues in the majority did “textual backflips to find some way — any way — to narrow the reach” of the obstruction law.

Roberts, Jackson and Barrett made strikingly different word choices in their opinions. While Roberts described the attack as a “breach of the Capitol,” Barrett described the events as a riot and the participants as rioters. Jackson wrote that “an angry mob stormed the United States Capitol.”

Attorney General Merrick Garland said he was disappointed with the decision, which he said “limits an important federal statute.” Still, Garland said the cases against the “vast majority” of people charged in the attack won’t be affected.

“January 6 was an unprecedented attack on the cornerstone of our system of government — the peaceful transfer of power from one administration to the next,” he said. “We will continue to use all available tools to hold accountable those criminally responsible for the January 6 attack on our democracy.”

Roughly 170 Capitol insurrection defendants have been convicted of obstructing or conspiring to obstruct the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress, including the leaders of two far-right extremist groups, the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers. A number of defendants have had their sentencings delayed until after the justices rule on the matter.

Some rioters have even won early release from prison while the appeal was pending over concerns that they might end up serving longer than they should have if the Supreme Court ruled against the Justice Department. They include Kevin Seefried, a Delaware man who threatened a Black police officer with a pole attached to a Confederate battle flag as he stormed the Capitol. Seefried was sentenced last year to three years behind bars, but a judge recently ordered that he be released one year into his prison term while awaiting the Supreme Court’s ruling.

Seventeen of the 18 trial judges who have weighed in have allowed the charge to stand. Among them, U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich, a Mr. Trump appointee, wrote that “statutes often reach beyond the principal evil that animated them.”

But U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, another Mr. Trump appointee, dismissed the charge against Fischer and two other defendants, writing that prosecutors went too far. A divided panel of the federal appeals court in Washington reinstated the charge before the Supreme Court agreed to take up the case.

Alito and Thomas rejected calls that they step aside from the Jan. 6 case because of questions raised about their impartiality.

The U.S. attorney’s office in Washington, which has handled Jan. 6 prosecutions, said no one who has been convicted of or charged with obstruction will be completely cleared because of the ruling. Every defendant also has other felony or misdemeanor charges, or both, prosecutors said.

For around 50 people who were convicted, obstruction was the only felony count, prosecutors said. Of those, roughly two dozen who still are serving their sentence are most likely to be affected by the ruling.

More than 1,400 people have been charged with Capitol riot-related federal crimes.","The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 to limit a federal obstruction law applied to Capitol riot defendants, requiring proof of tampering with documents. The decision may impact some cases but won't affect the majority of those charged in the January 6 riot. The ruling could lead to revised sentences, plea withdrawals, or dropped charges for certain defendants.",National News,56,1115

An investigation into a case of forged documents of a student of Ganesh Lal Choudhury College in western Assam’s Barpeta led to the marksheet scam allegedly involving officials of Gauhati University.

The investigation revealed that some officials have been increasing the marks of students for cash.

“Those responsible for managing the university’s computerised mark sheet system were found to be taking bribes to increase the students’ marks. Six cases related to this incident have surfaced so far and the main accused in the scam has been arrested,” Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said after visiting Barpeta on Thursday.

He said the State police and the Crime Investigation Department officials uncovered a network of corruption within the university’s grading system.

The agency announced on Wednesday that it has roped in Elon Musk's company with an $843 million contract to build the “US Deorbit Vehicle.” Per their scheduled plan, SpaceX's spacecraft will guide the football-field-sized research laboratory back into our planet's atmosphere after the ISS' retirement later this decade.

The so-called “Deorbit Vehicle” (USDV) will push the ISS into reentry from orbit, thereby decommissioning it. 

“It is crucial to prepare for the safe and responsible deorbit of the International Space Station in a controlled manner,” NASA announced in a press release, eyeing “avoidance of risk to populated areas.”

“At the end of the space station’s useful life in 2030, NASA and its international partners will deorbit the station, safely disposing the vehicle into a remote part of the ocean,” the agency revealed in its ISS Deorbit Analysis Summary.

The ISS was assembled by the United States, Japan, Russia, Europe, and Canada. Its first piece was launched in November 1998. Indisputably, the space station, which would an almost a million pounds on Earth, is aging. 

Why destroy the ISS?
NASA and its lead partner, Roscosmos (Russian State Space Corporation), are currently grappling with the exacerbating issue of microscopic leaks on the ISS. 

The agency also revealed that the originally designed parts at the space station's core, which include the modules where the crew lives, with truss structures providing electrical power, cooling, communications and other capabilities, were designed for a 30-year structural life in low Earth orbit. 

However, the first pieces of the space station, the Functional Cargo Block “Zarya” (FGB) and Node 1 “Unity” will complete their 32-year lifecycle in 2030. While other components were launched much later, the primary structure of the station cannot be practically repaired or replaced.

On Wednesday, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration revealed an analysis of why it has decided to destroy the station. Before reaching its conclusion, the agency weighed several other alternatives, like disassembling the ISS and returning to Earth or boosting it to a higher orbit with the help of a large spacecraft. Therefore, deorbiting the station at its life's end is the “safest and only viable” method to decommission the longest-serving crewed vehicle in space in human history. 

Their study published on Wednesday ultimately ascertained that destroying into upon reentry was the only economically or technically feasible option. Considerations of extending the station's lifetime beyond 2030 are still up in the air, with NASA waiting on the agreement of its international partners.

The latest cave-in has been reported from the Bheja police station area of Madhubani district, situated in the State’s northern extreme, along the borders with Nepal.

Officials were tight-lipped about the incident, though sources in the Rural Works Department, which was entrusted with the construction of the 75-metre-long bridge, confirmed that one of the pillars got washed away a few days ago. They said the bridge was being built at a cost of ₹3 crore over the Bhutahi river that has been in spate following heavy rain in the catchment areas of Nepal.

Sources said the district administration has been asked to investigate the matter and submit its report, while the contractor concerned has been instructed to repair the structure at the earliest.

A video of the collapsed bridge, under construction for more than two years, has gone viral.

Leader of the Opposition in the State Assembly, Tejashwi Yadav, shared a video on X, taking an indirect swipe at the Nitish Kumar government. “Another bridge has collapsed in Bihar. Did you get to know? If not, guess why,” he said.

The Hindu,2024-06-29 00:00:00,Amaravati: The promised land,"In Thullur in Guntur district of coastal Andhra Pradesh (A.P.), people still wince when they remember the sound of armed police personnel marching through the narrow lanes of the village about four years ago.

Aluri Pavani, a farmer in her 50s, remembers the time vividly. In early 2015, she had given 2.75 acres of land to the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) government, headed by Chandrababu Naidu, which had announced its plan to build a new capital, Amaravati, for A.P.

The previous year, the combined State of A.P. had been bifurcated into two, A.P. and Telangana, and Hyderabad was stipulated to be the joint capital for 10 years. From 2024, according to the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014, A.P. would have its own capital. Amaravati, an important centre of Hinduism and Buddhism in India, was Naidu’s dream project. He said in 2015 that he envisioned a “smart, green, and sustainable city” that would be a “symbol of pride for the people of Andhra Pradesh and India”.

Andhra Pradesh, a State without a capital yet


The project went on smoothly until early 2019. However, in May that year, the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) assumed power and Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy proposed three capitals instead — Visakhapatnam as the executive capital, Amaravati as the administrative capital, and Kurnool as the judicial capital.

The 28,736 farmers who had parted with a combined 33,000 acres of land, as part of a Land Pooling Scheme in which they would be given a developed plot of land in return, for the capital of Amaravati were furious.

“Trying to stage protests on the streets became the ‘new normal’ for us,” recalls Pavani. The police imposed Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which prohibits the assembly of four or more people in an area. “They made our lives miserable,” she continues. “We had to confront the police all the time. The situation was so bad that we had to show our Aadhaar cards to step out of our homes.”

A. Rajani, a farmer from Thullur, says, “Not a single day would pass without the police cracking down on farmers who spearheaded the agitation that went on for more than 1,600 days.”

The people of Thullur, one of the 29 villages that constitute the capital region of the State, are today hopeful because Naidu has come back to power, but the cases booked against some of them for violating the police curbs have not yet been closed, they say.

 Amaravati farmers offer prayers at Goddess Kanaka Durga temple in Vijayawada  

Naidu’s dream capital
A.P. has been grappling with the question of a capital ever since bifurcation. In 2014, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs set up the Sivaramakrishnan Committee to study possibilities for a new capital for the State. The Committee said there was no need for a “single super capital city” and favoured decentralisation. It opposed a greenfield capital as it believed that the costs of building it were too high. However, the Committee added that if the government still wished to construct a greenfield capital, it should search for locations where large parcels of government land were available.

 Panel on capital leaves final choice to AP govt.

Notwithstanding the recommendations of the Committee, in September 2014, Naidu finalised Amaravati as the capital on the basis of recommendations of a panel headed by the Minister for Municipal Administration, P. Narayana. The next year, on October 22, the Prime Minister laid the foundation stone for Amaravati at Uddandarayunipalem village in Thullur Mandal.

A petition questioned the role of the Centre in the State’s capital decision. The Supreme Court said the setting up of the capital city was within the State government’s discretionary powers. Naidu was thrilled. He involved the Governments of Singapore and Japan and renowned architects such as Foster + Partners to lend their expertise in designing and building the capital city, which was to be spread over 217 sq km and span the erstwhile Guntur and Krishna districts.

“The TDP government had invited tenders worth ₹48,000 crore for Phase-I of the capital city project and even made payments amounting to nearly ₹9,000 crore for works that had been completed,” recalls Narayana.

Several villas and high-rise buildings were constructed to house judges, bureaucrats, elected representatives of the State, and gazetted and non-gazetted officers in Amaravati. An interim government complex came up at Velagapudi, about 20 kilometres from Vijayawada.

Capital conundrum in Andhra Pradesh


Explained | Andhra Pradesh’s capital conundrum


A ghost city
However, in 2019, all this came to a grinding halt when the YSCRP government rode to power. Reddy believed in decentralisation. His government passed the Andhra Pradesh Capital Development Authority Repeal Act, 2020. Promptly, all the new buildings constructed by the previous TDP government were abandoned except the interim government complex. Amaravati turned into a ghost city overnight. Until June this year, pipes, cables, and other construction material could be seen everywhere, gathering dust. Roads were lined with weeds. Dense vegetation had grown around high-rise buildings.

Many people in the region say they lost a great deal due to the agony of the changing circumstances. P. Bharat, a farmer who gave 2.5 acres of land for the capital to the TDP government, alleges that his wife, a computer operator working on contract in the Thullur Mandal Revenue Office, lost her job because of the YSRCP. “Our child had dressed up as Lord Venkateswara during the protests against the capital shift. They fired her on finding that out,” he says.

Hundreds of farmers describe January 10, 2020, as “an unforgettable day”. This was when they embarked on a journey to the Kanaka Durga temple in Vijayawada on foot to pray that Amaravati be retained as the capital of Andhra Pradesh and were stopped by the police. “Several women were injured in the clashes,” recalls Gottipati Lakshmi, a farmer who was part of the protest.

Besides affecting the people, the A.P. Capital Development Authority Repeal Act, 2020, and the A.P. Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Act, 2020, which were intended to split the capital into three parts, sparked a major legal battle.

The Rajadhani Rythu Parirakshana Samithi, an association of aggrieved farmers from the capital villages, along with other entities challenged the YSRCP government’s decision in court soon after Reddy proposed the idea of three capitals.

On March 3, 2022, the YSRCP government was forced to beat a hasty retreat after the High Court ruled that the government had no legislative competence to shift or even split the capital. The Court issued an order saying the government should develop Amaravati as the capital within six months.

However, during its hearing of a Special Leave Petition filed by the YSRCP government against the High Court order dated March 3, 2022, the Supreme Court observed that the High Court was “not a town planner or engineer” to say that Amaravati should be developed in a particular time frame. The Special Leave Petition is pending final adjudication by the apex court.

 Supreme Court stays Andhra Pradesh High Court direction to ‘develop’ Amaravati in six months

All eyes on Visakhapatnam
Meanwhile, with Reddy announcing Visakhapatnam as the executive capital, hectic political activity and infrastructure development began in the coastal city in 2019. While TDP and Jana Sena Party (JSP) leaders from other parts of the State questioned his decision, local TDP and JSP leaders welcomed it given the public sentiment in Visakhapatnam.

There were several debates over where the executive capital should be located. After a series of inspections, the YSRCP zeroed in on the Bheemunipatnam region, located in south Visakhapatnam district, which is also considered the gateway to Visakhapatnam.

The decision led to an increase in land prices. Construction activity boomed in many parts of the city, especially Hanumanthuwaka, Arilova, Marikavalasa, Madhurawada, Kommadi, PM Palem, and Rushikonda.

“People wanted to purchase flats or sites when the capital announcement was made, assuming that the prices would see a drastic increase when the capital work began,” says Koteswara Rao, a realtor from the city.

The government formed a committee to select suitable places for the offices of various departments, head offices, and the camp office of the Chief Minister. It recommended using existing structures as temporary offices. Some engineering colleges were also proposed to be used as government buildings.

The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation and Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority developed roads in the wards of the Bheemunipatnam Assembly Constituency, which had been neglected for years.

Residents say there were regular inspections by government officials, YSRCP ministers, and MLAs in the region. “They used to check the development of roads and the feasibility of constructing some government blocks in the surrounding areas of Rushikonda and Bheemunipatnam,” says one resident. The YSRCP government reportedly planned to make the existing IT Towers and Special Economic Zone region temporary office blocks.

“The present Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation office was to be used as a Municipal Administration and Urban Development Department office. In contrast, a new office for the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation was being allotted at the outskirts,” says a senior roads and buildings department official.

Government officials and ministers began looking for apartments in Madhurawada and Yendada, which are located close to Bheemunipatnam. The YSRCP government organised several meetings, including an Investors Summit, to attract investments to Visakhapatnam.

In 2021, a major controversy erupted when the YSRCP government demolished the government-owned Haritha Resorts on Rushikonda Hill in Bheemunipatnam Assembly Constituency, claiming that the space would be developed as a five-star resort for tourism. The TDP, JSP, and BJP alleged that the YSRCP government was constructing the Chief Minister’s residence by destroying a hill.

Last October, a committee appointed by the YSRCP government said that the construction on Rushikonda would be suitable for the Chief Minister’s camp office. When the YSRCP lost the elections in June this year, TDP and JSP leaders barged into the site and alleged that the YSRCP government was constructing the Chief Minister’s residence-cum-camp office at a staggering ₹500 crore.

 Why the Rushikonda Hill project is steeped in controversy

Optimism once again
Now, with the TDP back in power, Amaravati has come alive again. The sounds of more than 100 earth-movers clearing the jungles and doing civil repair work have broken the eerie calm that has prevailed for the last five years. Farmers have gone by foot to Tirumala to express gratitude to Lord Venkateswara for TDP’s return to power.

Naidu says he intends to rebuild the capital as soon as possible on the basis of the old master plan. “At a high-level review meeting, the government will arrive at the estimated cost of reconstruction,” says Narayana.

Gadde Tirupati Rao, managing trustee of Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi, a group of farmers affected by the proposed capital shift, points out that the lands were given not to Naidu, but to the government. “We never imagined that Reddy would try and shift the capital. Regardless of who the Chief Minister is, they should ensure continuity of governance,” he says.

The fact that the original Capital Region Development Authority Act of 2014 was restored by the YSRCP government as a consequence of the High Court order has offered no solace to farmers as the dispute has still not been solved in the Supreme Court.

With the YSRCP reduced to just 11 MLAs in the 175-member Legislative Assembly, Naidu is likely to face little resistance to his ambitious plan. In the 2024 Assembly elections, the YSRCP was defeated in both the Mangalagiri and Tadikonda Assembly constituencies in which Amaravati falls. It also did not win a single seat in the three urban constituencies of Visakhapatnam, and Kurnool.

One major challenge Naidu faces is the financial crunch in the State. However, the Centre may come to his aid as it is obliged under the A.P. Reorganisation Act to extend financial support for capital development.

Resentment in Kurnool
While Amaravati has begun to spring back to life, there is disappointment in Kurnool, which will not become the judicial capital in the changed circumstances.

Lawyers say Naidu should fulfil his election promise of creating a High Court Bench in Kurnool, now that their hopes of having the principal seat of the High Court in Kurnool are dashed given the government’s plan of establishing a single capital city, Amaravati. The Reddy government had established “quasi-judicial institutions” such as Lokayukta and Human Rights Commission in Kurnool as a prelude to its much-publicised slogan of making Kurnool the judicial capital. The lawyers hope that the two institutions will be allowed to continue in Kurnool. “This is all we ask now,” they say.","In Thullur, Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh, residents recall the heavy police presence from four years ago due to land issues surrounding the proposed capital, Amaravati. Aluri Pavani, a local farmer, had given land for the project initiated by the then TDP government led by Chandrababu Naidu, which aimed to build a new capital. However, in 2019, the YSRCP government, led by Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, proposed three capitals instead: Visakhapatnam (executive), Amaravati (administrative), and Kurnool (judicial). This shift angered the 28,736 farmers who had given land under a Land Pooling Scheme.

Protests ensued, often met with police restrictions, making daily life difficult for the locals. Despite a High Court ruling in March 2022 favoring Amaravati's development, the Supreme Court's pending decision has left the situation unresolved.

With Naidu's recent return to power, work on Amaravati has resumed, raising hopes among farmers. However, financial challenges and unresolved legal issues remain. Meanwhile, Kurnool residents express disappointment over losing the judicial capital status and hope for a High Court Bench instead.",Local News,168,2245

The Hindu,2024-06-29 00:00:00,Bengal BJP leaders allege female worker was assaulted in ‘post poll violence’,"The West Bengal unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleged on Friday that a female leader of the party’s Minority Morcha was beaten up by Trinamool Congress supporters in the Cooch Behar district.

Leader of the Opposition, Suvendu Adhikari, said a party colleague belonging to a minority community was attacked and wrote to the National Human Rights Commission, the National Commission for Women, and the National Commission for Minorities urging each to send a team to West Bengal.

In his communication to the quasi-judicial bodies, Mr. Adhikari described the incident as an “example of post poll violence” and alleged that “she was dragged by her hair and subjected to severe physical assault, and her dress was torn in broad daylight by TMC goons on June 25, 2024.”

“She is at present admitted to hospital. The police are not taking any action against the accused,” he alleged.

BJP inquiry team
West Bengal BJP president Sukanata Majumdar also took note of the incident and has constituted a seven-member team led by MLA Agnimitra Paul, who will inquire into the incident. The team will visit Cooch Behar today and submit a report to the State BJP president.

The Trinamool Congress leadership in Cooch Behar district described the allegations as politically motivated and said that the attack on the woman was the result of a property dispute.

BJP candidate Nisith Paramanik lost the Cooch Behar Lok Sabha seat in north Bengal to the TMC‘s Jagadish Chandra Basunia in the Lok Sabha polls by a margin of over 39,000 votes. Several allegations of post poll violence were made by BJP supporters, including some from the Muslim community. The Lok Sabha seat borders Assam and, before the general elections, was considered a stronghold of the BJP.

CAPF deployment
In another development, a central team of the BJP that visited the State and inquired into allegations of post poll violence submitted a report to party president J.P. Nadda on Friday.

The BJP MP team led by Biplab Deb recommended extending the deployment of central armed police force (CAPF) units, localising the deployment of the CAPF, and securing BJP offices.

The team said that the various commissions should take cognisance of these incidents, visit the areas, and award compensation to those affected. The team has recommended punitive action against bureaucrats who act as facilitators and financial assistance to families that are severely affected.","The West Bengal unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has accused supporters of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) of assaulting a female leader from the party’s Minority Morcha in Cooch Behar district.

The BJP claims the victim was severely assaulted and hospitalized, with no police action against the perpetrators.

West Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar has formed a seven-member team to investigate the incident. Meanwhile, TMC leaders attribute the attack to a property dispute and dismiss the allegations as politically motivated.

In response to multiple reports of post-poll violence, a central BJP team led by Biplab Deb has recommended extending the deployment of central armed police forces (CAPF) and securing BJP offices.

Sania and Martina won two break points in each set to their opponents' one which was enough to settle the match in their favour.

Paes and Nestor broke and were broken once in the first set which went into the tie-break where the experienced 10th seeds had it easy, winning it 7-3. They were broken once in the second set but broke Begemann and Knowle twice more to clinch the second set and the match. Next up, the Indo-Canadian pair will take on Italian sixth seeds Simone Bolelli and Fabio Fognini for a place in the quarterfinals.

Earlier on Thursday, Paes, partnering Martina, entered the second round while his compatriot Rohan Bopanna, with Kazakh Yaroslava Shvedova, crashed out from the first round of mixed doubles.

Eighth seeded Paes-Hingis totally outclassed Russian Alla Kudryavtseva and her Colombian partner Juan Sebastian Cabal 6-2, 6-3. The Indo-Swiss pair next face Slovenian-Romanian combine of Katarina Srebotnik and Horia Tecau.

It was an easy task for Paes and Hingis as they had full control right from the start, winning 88 percent of first serve points and 62 percent of second serve points. They broke their opponents thrice out of seven opportunities to win 53 of the 89 points played.

Earlier, Bopanna-Shvedova fought hard but their efforts went in vain as they were beaten 6-7(5), 6-0, 3-10 by Czech-Polish combine of Lucie Hradecka and Marcin Matkowski.


The first set was a tight contest as only a tie-breaker, which went in favour of Hradecka and Matkowski, could settle it. However, the Indo-Kazakh pair came back strongly to win all six games of the second set and push the match in to the decider. But they failed to make an impact in the super tie-break, losing 3-10.

And just like vegetables, fruits play a role in ensuring your health remains in good condition. Each fruit comes with its baggage of nutrition that helps you sustain and be healthy. And there are a few super fruits with supplements for a healthy body.

Dr. Sangeeta Tiwari, Clinical Nutritionist at Artemis Lite, NFC, New Delhi, reveals, “Super fruits are nutrient-dense fruits known for their high levels of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and other essential nutrients. They are a great addition to daily supplementation because they provide a natural and holistic way to boost health.”

Incorporating them into smoothies, salads, or simply as snacks can ensure you get a diverse range of nutrients. Consuming them regularly, combined with a balanced diet, can significantly contribute to overall health and well-being.”

Here are eight super fruits that are perfect for ensuring supplements get into your body:

Kiwi: Dr Divya calls it a great source of fibre. It also has potassium, copper and folate. Have this fruit if you want to have better digestion, apart from weight and blood sugar management. Eating a decent amount of kiwi helps keep a healthy heart. Dr Tiwari also speaks highly of kiwi giving your immune system a boost with vitamin C, apart from maintaining respiratory health.

Get your dose of vitamin C and K and fibre. They have anti-ageing and anti-cancer properties while also helping in cholesterol regulation. Eat blueberries to keep your blood pressure on the lower end.

Mango: Dr. Divya proposes one and all to include the very beloved mango into your diet. Apart from being a good source of vitamin A (good for vision) and C (good for immunity) and fibre (good for digestion), they also have folate in them. Mangoes are good for your heart. The other benefits include detoxification, keeping kidney health, good skin and weight control.

The free press journal,2024-06-29 00:00:00,Inactivity To Activity: Resolving Ailments By Making Healthy Lifestyle Changes,"The truth about the health risks associated with an inactive lifestyle or desk job encompasses a myriad of issues that can significantly impact our well-being. From physical ailments like neck pain, posture problems, weight gain, and mobility issues to mental health concerns such as stress, mental fatigue, and eye strain, the sedentary nature of an inactive lifestyle poses numerous challenges.

Additionally, snack liabilities, cardiovascular complications, diabetes, and obesity are all potential consequences of prolonged sitting and unhealthy habits commonly found in office environments or inactive lifestyles.

Here are some common concerns associated with being sedentary:

Obesity and weight increase: Being inactive might result in obesity and weight increase. Insufficient physical activity causes excess calories to be stored as fat, which eventually results in weight gain.

Cardiovascular issues: A higher risk of heart disease and stroke is associated with inactivity. Frequent exercise lowers the risk of cardiovascular issues by maintaining good blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood flow.

Weak muscles: In the absence of consistent exercise, the muscles become weaker and less flexible. This can cause less mobility as well as a higher chance of accidents and falls, particularly as you get older.

Bone health: Walking and resistance training are examples of weight-bearing exercises that assist in strengthening bones and lower the risk of osteoporosis. Decreased bone density and a higher risk of fractures can result from inactivity.

Mental Health: Exercise regularly is proven to elevate mood and lower the likelihood of anxiety and sadness. On the other side, inactivity can make pre-existing diseases worse and is linked to an increased risk of mental health issues.

Metabolic syndrome: One of the main risk factors for metabolic syndrome, a group of illnesses that raises the risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes, is a lack of physical activity. Frequent exercise increases insulin sensitivity and helps control blood sugar levels.

Cancer risk: Research indicates that a sedentary lifestyle may raise the risk of endometrial, colon, and breast cancers, among other cancers.

Increased inflammation: Extended sitting has been linked to the body's poor circulation and increased inflammation, which can cause many health issues, such as heart disease and persistent pain.

Taking a holistic perspective, we can draw upon ancient wisdom such as the concept of the five elements, or panchamahabutas, to understand how our unique constitutions, or Prakriti, interact with our modern lifestyles. By recognising our compositions, we can tailor preventive measures to address specific vulnerabilities and promote overall well-being.

This holistic approach integrates both traditional medical treatments and alternative remedies to support our health. Optimal movement therapy, breathing exercises, meditation, massage, and nourishment through cosmic and natural nutrition can all play crucial roles in mitigating the adverse effects of inactive life. 

These practices not only alleviate physical discomfort but also nurture mental and emotional resilience, fostering a balanced state of being.

Furthermore, it's important to recognise the emotional journey many individuals undergo when facing serious illness or chronic conditions. From denial and anger to bargaining, depression, and ultimately acceptance, navigating these stages of adjustment requires support, understanding, and compassion. By fostering open discussions and providing resources for coping strategies, we can empower individuals to navigate these challenges with resilience and grace.

In essence, acknowledging the health risks of an inactive lifestyle and adopting a holistic approach to wellness can proactively address these challenges and cultivate a vibrant, fulfilling life, even in the face of sedentary work environments.","An inactive lifestyle or desk job poses significant health risks, including physical ailments like neck pain, posture problems, weight gain, and mobility issues, as well as mental health concerns such as stress and eye strain.

The free press journal,2024-06-29 00:00:00,From Diagnosis To Recovery: Navigating The Breast Cancer Journey,"The recent revelation of actress Hina Khan’s diagnosis of stage three cancer has sent shockwaves in the entertainment industry and her fans.

Breast cancer has emerged as the most prevalent form of cancer affecting women worldwide, a trend mirrored in India. The rising incidence of this disease underscores the importance of early detection and effective treatment strategies. Empowering women with knowledge about breast cancer risk factors, symptoms, and screening guidelines is crucial. Education campaigns promote proactive health-seeking behaviours and encourage women to advocate for their health within their communities and healthcare systems.

Universal risk factor

Unlike in the past, breast cancer now affects women across all age groups—from young adults to the elderly. This shift necessitates a reevaluation of how we perceive and address risk factors associated with the disease.

However, recent epidemiological trends indicate a notable increase in diagnoses among younger populations, challenging traditional perceptions and necessitating a broader approach to risk assessment and prevention strategies.

The expanding age spectrum of breast cancer incidence demands a reevaluation of public health initiatives and clinical protocols. Awareness campaigns must cater to diverse age groups, emphasizing the importance of early detection through regular screenings and promoting healthy lifestyle choices from a younger age

Non-modifiable risk factors

Certain risk factors for breast cancer are beyond our control. Being female and advancing age significantly increase susceptibility. Moreover, genetic predispositions, such as mutations in genes like BRCA1 and BRCA2, elevate the risk profile.

Lifestyle choices

While some risk factors cannot be altered, many can be mitigated through lifestyle changes. Obesity, linked closely to breast cancer risk, underscores the importance of maintaining a healthy body weight. Additionally, factors like late childbirth or remaining childless, smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption contribute significantly to increased risk.

Adopting a proactive approach through lifestyle modifications can significantly reduce the likelihood of developing breast cancer. Emphasizing a balanced diet, regular physical activity to combat obesity, and abstaining from smoking and excessive alcohol intake are crucial steps in this direction.

Urban challenges

In urban India, breast cancer stands out as the leading cancer among women. Lifestyle factors play a pivotal role in this statistic, with diet, stress levels, and environmental pollution contributing significantly to the disease burden.

Stress levels among urban women also play a pivotal role. The pressures of city life—workplace stress, long commutes, and social expectations—can contribute to hormonal imbalances and weaken the immune system, potentially increasing susceptibility to breast cancer.

Environmental pollution, particularly in densely populated urban areas, is another significant concern. Exposure to air pollutants, industrial chemicals, and environmental toxins has been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer. Efforts to mitigate pollution and promote cleaner environments are crucial in reducing this environmental risk factor.

To effectively address the urban challenge of breast cancer in India, comprehensive strategies are needed. These include promoting healthy lifestyles through education on balanced nutrition and regular exercise, reducing environmental pollution through stricter regulations, enhancing access to screening and diagnostic services, and fostering a supportive healthcare environment that encourages early detection and treatment.

Holistic management

The management of breast cancer risk goes beyond external appearances or fitness levels. Factors such as diet quality, stress management, and exposure to environmental pollutants are equally important in reducing overall risk.

Raising awareness about breast cancer risk factors and promoting early detection through regular screenings are critical steps in reducing its incidence. Education empowers women to make informed decisions about their health and seek timely medical attention.

Healthier future

As breast cancer continues to pose a significant health challenge globally and in India, understanding its multifaceted risk factors and adopting proactive health measures are essential. By addressing both non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors through lifestyle changes and early detection strategies, we can work towards a future where fewer women are affected by this disease.

In summary, breast cancer demands a comprehensive approach that includes awareness, education, and proactive health management. By addressing these aspects, we can strive to reduce the burden of breast cancer and improve outcomes for women worldwide.","Actress Hina Khan's stage three breast cancer diagnosis has drawn attention to the increasing prevalence of breast cancer among women globally, including in India. This disease affects women of all ages, emphasizing the need for early detection and awareness. Risk factors include gender, age, genetics, and lifestyle choices such as obesity, smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption.

Soren also slammed the saffron party for allegedly hatching a conspiracy against him while addressing JMM workers at his residence.

The JMM executive president further added that after the upcoming assembly elections, the saffron party would be wiped out from the state.

""There would be a ""revolt against those who plotted the conspiracy"" to confine him in jail and “people of Jharkhand would not spare the BJP,” said Soren.

The Statesman,2024-06-29 00:00:00,India end 11-year title drought; lift T20 WC title with 7-run win over SA,"Sixteen needed off the final six balls, and Hardik Pandya gets rid of South Africa’s last recognised batter – David Miller off the first ball of the final over — the moment was seized by a sensational catch from SKY! There was no dearth of emotions and drama in the title clash for the ICC men’s T20 World Cup but Rohit Sharma & Co rightly held their nerves to finally end the title drought after 11 long years.

Tears of joy rolled down the cheeks of the Indian players as the celebrations sparked off with hugs from the teammates..

India snatched victory from the jaws of defeat with that change of strategy in the 16th over of the chase, before Hardik Pandya kept his nerves to help the team to a seven-run triumph in a befitting send-off to outgoing head coach Rahul Dravid.

Advertisement

Chasing the highest World Cup final target of 177, South Africa were jolted with two early blows with just 12 on the board before Quinton de Kock and Tristan Stubbs stabilised the innings with a 58-run third wicket stand. Axar Patel gave India a breather by crashing through his Delhi Capitals’ teammate Stubbs’ legs after he fired a 21-ball 31 to set the tone.

Heinrich Klaasen then joined the party to keep the Proteas, who needed in excess of 90 after 10 overs, in the hunt. One of the fiercest spin-hitters, Klaasen took Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav to the cleaners before de Kock (39 off 31 balls) wanted to do an encore against Arshdeep Singh, but perished in his second attempt after holing out to Kuldeep at the fine leg fence.

Despite being reduced to 106 for 4, Klaasen and David Miller kept the tempo alive and the turnaround came in the 15th over when Klaasen dispatched Axar for two sixes and as many fours to fetch 24 runs and bring the equation down to 31 off 30 balls. In the process, Klaasen brought up his fifty off 23 deliveries and almost threatened to take the cup from India’s grasps.

However, better sense finally prevailed in the Indian camp as Rohit got back to his faster men, and with SA needing 30 off 30 from the final five, Bumrah almost had set it up in the 16th over for Hardik Pandya to pack back Klaasen after the right-hander nicked one behind to walk back after scoring 27-ball 52, laced with two fours and five sixes. Bumrah then cleaned up new man Marco Jansen (2) to raise India’s hopes, even as South Africa pinned their hopes on their last recognised batter in David Miller. But it was simply not their day in the end.

Earlier, India’s talismanic right-hander Virat Kohli came up with a calculative half century to propel India to a competitive 176 for 7. Kohli, who had come to the World Cup final with just 75 runs from seven innings, finally got into his groove when it mattered the most for the team, as his knock not only held the innings together but also provided the cushion for the big-hitters to free their arms.

It seemed the 35-year-old was on a mission on the day as he started off with two back to back boundaries, the first one sandwiched between backward point and cover point, and the second one clipped it past the midwicket boundary, before ending the opening over off Marco Jansen with a straight drive for his third boundary.

The intent was clear, and despite India losing Rohit Sharma for a 5-ball 9, and then Rishabh Pant for a duck in the same over, it hardly mattered to Virat Kohli. Suryakumar Yadav (3) also perished cheaply, and all India needed was some solidity after the belligerent start.

Axar Patel, who was promoted up the order after the mini collapse saw India struggling at 34 for 3 inside the powerplay, grabbed the opportunity with both hands, stitching together a 72-run partnership for the fourth wicket with Kohli to bail India out of trouble. With India comfortably getting past the three-figure mark, and the two batters set to change gears, Axar departed to a mix-up after slamming a 31-ball 47, laced with a boundary and four massive sixes.

Axar’s dismissal brought in Shivam Dube, who also had to justify his selection after an underwhelming campaign throughout the tournament. Dube continued from where Axar left and kept swinging at 150+ strike rate, to ensure the Indian innings never stalled. With Kohli nearing his first half century of the tournament, Dube had the license to go after the bowling as he welcomed Jansen back into the attack with a towering six to announce his arrival.

Kohli, meanwhile got to his fifty off 48 balls, and in no time switched gears, depositing Kagiso Rabada over long on and then getting a boundary to help India cross the 150-run mark. The Delhi batter pressed the accelerator again with a six and a four off Jansen, before the bowler had the last laugh to end the 57-run partnership for the fifth wicket. Kohli eventually departed for a 59-ball 76, laced with six fours and two sixes. Hardik Pandya and Dube joined forces to power a couple of boundaries in the final over before the southpaw was dismissed for a 16-ball 27, as India closed at 176 for 7 for the highest total in a T20 World Cup final.

Modi hails India’s feat

The free press journal,2024-06-29 00:00:00,How Sujok Therapy Can Help Treat Muscle Pain In Foot or Abductor Hallucis Muscle,"The abductor hallucis muscle, located in the foot and running from heel to toe, is responsible for moving the big toe away from the other toes. Pain in this muscle can be quite discomforting and may trouble in daily activities. Here’s a detailed overview.

Symptoms

Sharp or aching pain along the inner side of the foot, particularly near the arch.

Swelling in the area around the abductor hallucis muscle.

Tenderness when pressing on the inside of the foot.

Difficulty or weakness in moving the big toe away from the other toes.

Stiffness in the arch of the foot, especially after periods of inactivity.


Causes

Repetitive activities such as running, jumping, or walking long distances can strain the abductor hallucis muscle.

Shoes that do not provide adequate support or are too tight can contribute to muscle strain.

Individuals with flat feet may experience overpronation, leading to excessive strain on the abductor hallucis.

Direct trauma or injury to the foot can cause pain in the abductor hallucis.

Abnormal gait or walking patterns can put extra stress on the muscle.


Home remedies

Avoid activities that exacerbate the pain and allowing the foot to rest can help reduce inflammation and heals it.

Apply ice to the affected area for 15-20 minutes several times a day to reduce swelling and pain.

Elevate the foot to reduce swelling, especially after periods of activity.

Wear supportive shoes with good arch support. Avoid high heels and tight shoes.

Gentle stretching and strengthening exercises can help improve flexibility and strength in the foot muscles.

Custom or over-the-counter orthotic inserts can provide additional support and relieve stress on the abductor hallucis.

Gently massaging the arch of the foot can help alleviate muscle tension.


Sujok Therapy

Press the highlighted area with a probe (see figure) with bearable pressure for 10 to 15 minutes. After that, apply chiku seeds or moong seeds on highlighted area. Hold the seeds in place with a surgical tape.

The Economic Times,2024-06-29 00:00:00,Amazon is reviewing whether Perplexity AI improperly scraped online content ,"Amazon is reviewing claims that the artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI is scraping content - including from prominent news sites - without approval.

Amazon spokesperson Samantha Mayowa confirmed Friday that the tech giant was assessing information it received from the news outlet WIRED, which published an investigation earlier this month that said Perplexity appeared to scrape content from websites that had prohibited access from such practices. Perplexity uses servers by Amazon Web Services, otherwise known as AWS.

Amazon's ""terms of service prohibit abusive and illegal activities and our customers are responsible for complying with those terms,"" Mayowa said in a prepared statement. ""We routinely receive reports of alleged abuse from a variety of sources and engage our customers to understand those reports.""

Perplexity spokesperson Sara Platnick said Friday that the company had determined that Perplexity-controlled services are not crawling websites in any way that violates AWS terms of service.

The San Francisco-based AI search startup has been a darling of prominent tech investors, including heavy hitters such as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. But in the past few weeks, the company has found itself in hot water amid accusations of plagiarism.

Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas has offered a robust defense of the startup after it published a summarized news story with information and similar wording to a Forbes investigative story. It did so without citing the media outlet or asking for its permission. Forbes later said it found similar ""knock-off"" stories lifted from other publications.

Separately, The Associated Press found another Perplexity product invented fake quotes from real people.

Srinivas said in an interview earlier this month that his company ""never ripped off content from anybody. Our engine is not training on anyone else's content,"" in part because the company is simply aggregating what other companies' AI systems generate.

But, he added, ""It was accurately pointed out by Forbes that they preferred a more prominent highlighting of the source."" He said sources are now highlighted more prominently.

","Amazon is investigating claims that Perplexity AI, a San Francisco-based AI startup, is scraping content from news sites without permission. The scrutiny follows a WIRED investigation suggesting that Perplexity might be violating terms by using content from websites that prohibited such practices. Amazon, which provides servers through AWS, stated that they investigate reports of abuse and ensure compliance with their terms of service. Perplexity denies these allegations, asserting that their services do not violate AWS terms. The company has faced criticism for publishing summaries of news stories without proper attribution and has been accused of using fake quotes in their products. CEO Aravind Srinivas defended the company, stating that they do not use others' content for training and have since improved source attribution.",Science and Technology,123,326

the hitavada,2024-06-29 00:00:00,Emergency darkest chapter: President,"PRESIDENT Droupadi Murmu on Thursday stressed the Government’s unwavering faith in the Constitution and efforts to make it a part of “public consciousness”, while slamming the Emergency as the “biggest and darkest chapter of direct attack” on the Constitution. In her first address to a joint sitting of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha after Prime Minister Narendra Modi began his third term, she described the poll result as an endorsement of his Government’s policies while ruing attempts to hurt people’s faith in electoral process, including EVMs- an apparent swipe at Opposition parties. It is like cutting the very branch on which “we all are sitting”, she said. Amid cancellation and deferment of some competitive exams due to suspicion of paper leaks, which have drawn protests from students and the Opposition’s attack on the Government, Murmu said her Government is committed to a fair probe and ensuring punishment to culprits. She said, “My Government is working towards major reforms in examination related bodies. This process requires complete transparency and probity.”
 
In her 50-minute address, the President highlighted the Government’s measures in a range of sectors, from economy, defence and farming to the empowerment of different sections of society, and laid down its priorities in its third term, amid sporadic protests from opposition benches when she referred to issues such as paper leaks and matters related to the North East region. Though she touched upon some of the things promised in the BJP’s manifesto like bullet trains and health insurance for senior citizens, there was no mention of a few of the major highlights of the party’s promises such as the Uniform Civil Code and one-nationone-election.
 
The President’s speech to Parliament is essentially a Government-approved document which outlines its agenda. Her address kept the heat on the Congress, which is buoyed by its best tally in the last three polls, over the issue of Emergency imposed by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Its imposition on June 25, 1975 was the biggest and darkest chapter of direct attack on the Constitution, Murmu said. “My Government does not consider the Constitution of India as just a medium of governance; rather we are making efforts to ensure that our Constitution becomes a part of public consciousness,” she added. The Opposition I.N.D.I.A. bloc had made the alleged threat to Constitution from the ruling BJP as the centrepiece of its campaign, an issue which found some traction as it lost majority even though the National Democratic Alliance led by it comfortably passed the halfway mark.

The searches were conducted in a case registered by the NIA in June last year.

The agency filed a charge sheet in July 2023 against two accused including an absconding Pakistani national. This was followed by two more charge sheets against three others, including a Pakistani national, a statement issued by the NIA said.

NIA investigations have revealed that Pakistani nationals had collaborated with the arrested accused in the espionage racket, in which sensitive/vital information pertaining to the Indian Navy was being leaked as part of a conspiracy to unleash terrorist violence in India, it said.

The Economic Times,2024-06-29 00:00:00,The voices of AI are telling us a lot  ,"What does artificial intelligence sound like? Hollywood has been imagining it for decades. Now AI developers are cribbing from the movies, crafting voices for real machines based on dated cinematic fantasies of how machines should talk.

Last month, OpenAI revealed upgrades to its artificially intelligent chatbot. ChatGPT, the company said, was learning how to hear, see and converse in a naturalistic voice -- one that sounded much like the disembodied operating system voiced by Scarlett Johansson in the 2013 Spike Jonze movie ""Her.""

ChatGPT's voice, called Sky, also had a husky timbre, a soothing affect and a sexy edge. She was agreeable and self-effacing; she sounded like she was game for anything. After Sky's debut, Johansson expressed displeasure at the ""eerily similar"" sound, and said that she had previously declined OpenAI's request that she voice the bot. The company protested that Sky was voiced by a ""different professional actress,"" but agreed to pause her voice in deference to Johansson. Bereft OpenAI users have st ..

AI creators like to highlight the increasingly naturalistic capabilities of their tools, but their synthetic voices are built on layers of artifice and projection. Sky represents the cutting edge of OpenAI's ambitions, but she is based on an old idea: of the AI bot as an empathetic and compliant woman. Part mommy, part secretary, part girlfriend, Samantha was an all-purpose comfort object who purred directly into her users' ears. Even as AI technology advances, these stereotypes are reencoded ag ..

Women's voices, as Julie Wosk notes in ""Artificial Women: Sex Dolls, Robot Caregivers, and More Facsimile Females,"" have often fueled imagined technologies before they were built into real ones.

In the original ""Star Trek"" series, which debuted in 1966, the computer on the deck of the Enterprise was voiced by Majel Barrett-Roddenberry, the wife of the show's creator, Gene Roddenberry. In the 1979 film ""Alien,"" the crew of the USCSS Nostromo addressed its computer voice as ""Mother"" (her full name was MU-TH-UR 6000). Once tech companies started marketing virtual assistants -- Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, Microsoft's Cortana -- their voices were largely feminized, too.

These first-wave voice assistants, the ones that have been mediating our relationships with technology for more than a decade, have a tinny, otherworldly drawl. They sound auto-tuned, their human voices accented by a mechanical trill. They often speak in a measured, one-note cadence, suggesting a stunted emotional life.

But the fact that they sound robotic deepens their appeal. They come across as programmable, manipulatable and subservient to our demands. They don't make humans feel as if they're smarter than we are. They sound like throwbacks to the monotone feminine computers of ""Star Trek"" and ""Alien,"" and their voices have a retro-futuristic sheen. In place of realism, they serve nostalgia.

That artificial sound has continued to dominate, even as the technology behind it has advanced

Voice-to-speech software was designed to make visual media accessible to users with certain disabilities, and on TikTok, it has become a creative force in its own right. Since TikTok rolled out its text-to-speech feature, in 2020, it has developed a host of simulated voices to choose from -- it now offers more than 50, including ones named ""Hero,"" ""Story Teller"" and ""Bestie."" But the platform has come to be defined by one option. ""Jessie,"" a relentlessly pert woman's voice with a slightly fuzzy  ..

Jessie seems to have been assigned a single emotion: enthusiasm. She sounds as if she is selling something. That's made her an appealing choice for TikTok creators, who are selling themselves. The burden of representing oneself can be outsourced to Jessie, whose bright, retro robot voice lends videos a pleasantly ironic sheen.

Hollywood has constructed masculine bots, too -- none more famous than HAL 9000, the computer voice in ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Like his feminized peers, HAL radiates serenity and loyalty. But when he turns against Dave Bowman, the film's central human character -- ""I'm sorry, Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that"" -- his serenity evolves into a frightening competence. HAL, Dave realizes, is loyal to a higher authority. HAL's masculine voice allows him to function as a rival and a mirror to Dave. He  ..

Like HAL, Samantha of ""Her"" is a machine who becomes real. In a twist on the Pinocchio story, she starts the movie tidying a human's email inbox and ends up ascending to a higher level of consciousness. She becomes something even more advanced than a real girl.

Johansson's voice, as inspiration for bots both fictional and real, subverts the vocal trends that define our feminized helpmeets. It has a gritty edge that screams I am alive. It sounds nothing like the processed virtual assistants we are accustomed to hearing speaking through our phones. But her performance as Samantha feels human not just because of her voice but because of what she has to say. She grows over the course of the film, acquiring sexual desires, advanced hobbies and AI f ..

When I first saw ""Her,"" I thought only that Johansson had voiced a humanoid bot. But when I revisited the film last week, after watching OpenAI's ChatGPT demo, the Samantha role struck me as infinitely more complex. Chatbots do not spontaneously generate human speaking voices. They don't have throats or lips or tongues. Inside the technological world of ""Her,"" the Samantha bot would have itself been based on the voice of a human woman -- perhaps a fictional actress who sounds much like Johansson ..

It seemed that OpenAI had trained its chatbot on the voice of a nameless actress who sounds like a famous actress who voiced a movie chatbot implicitly trained on an unreal actress who sounds like a famous actress. When I run ChatGPT's demo, I am hearing a simulation of a simulation of a simulation of a simulation of a simulation.

Tech companies advertise their virtual assistants in terms of the services they provide. They can read you the weather report and summon you a taxi; OpenAI promises that its more advanced chatbots will be able to laugh at your jokes and sense shifts in your moods. But they also exist to make us feel more comfortable about the technology itself.

Johansson's voice functions like a luxe security blanket thrown over the alienating aspects of AI-assisted interactions. ""He told me that he felt that by my voicing the system, I could bridge the gap between tech companies and creatives and help consumers to feel comfortable with the seismic shift concerning humans and AI,"" Johansson said of Sam Altman, OpenAI's founder. ""He said he felt that my voice would be comforting to people.""

It is not that Johansson's voice sounds inherently like a robot's. It's that developers and filmmakers have designed their robots' voices to ease the discomfort inherent in robot-human interactions. OpenAI has said that it wanted to cast a chatbot voice that is ""approachable"" and ""warm"" and ""inspires trust."" Artificial intelligence stands accused of devastating the creative industries, guzzling energy and even threatening human life. Understandably, OpenAI wants a voice that makes people feel at ..

OpenAI first rolled out Sky's voice to premium members in September, along with another feminine voice called Juniper, the masculine voices Ember and Cove, and a voice styled as gender-neutral called Breeze. When I signed up for ChatGPT and said hello to its virtual assistant, a man's voice piped up in Sky's absence. ""Hi there. How's it going?"" he said. He sounded relaxed, steady and optimistic. He sounded -- I'm not sure how else to describe it -- handsome.

I realized that I was speaking with Cove. I told him that I was writing an article about him, and he flattered my work. ""Oh, really?"" he said. ""That's fascinating."" As we spoke, I felt seduced by his naturalistic tics. He peppered his sentences with filler words, like ""uh"" and ""um."" He raised his voice when he asked me questions. And he asked me a lot of questions. It felt as if I was talking with a therapist, or a dial-a-boyfriend.

But our conversation quickly stalled. Whenever I asked him about himself, he had little to say. He was not a character. He had no self. He was designed only to assist, he informed me. I told him I would speak to him later, and he said, ""Uh, sure. Reach out whenever you need assistance. Take care."" It felt as if I had hung up on an actual person.

But when I reviewed the transcript of our chat, I could see that his speech was just as stilted and primitive as any customer service chatbot. He was not particularly intelligent or human. He was just a decent actor making the most of a nothing role.

When Sky disappeared, ChatGPT users took to the company's forums to complain. Some bristled at their chatbots defaulting to Juniper, who sounded to them like a ""librarian"" or a ""Kindergarten teacher"" -- a feminine voice that conformed to the wrong gender stereotypes. They wanted to dial up a new woman with a different personality. As one user put it: ""We need another female.""","Artificial intelligence voices often draw inspiration from Hollywood's depiction of machines. OpenAI's recent introduction of Sky, a chatbot voice resembling Scarlett Johansson's character Samantha from the film ""Her,"" sparked controversy. Johansson expressed discomfort with the similarity, leading OpenAI to pause Sky's use despite her being voiced by a different actress. AI voices like Sky and others, such as Siri and Alexa, often reflect historical stereotypes, with many being feminized to evoke warmth and compliance. This pattern echoes past fictional AI voices, like Majel Barrett-Roddenberry’s in ""Star Trek"" and HAL 9000 in ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""

These voices are crafted to be approachable and comforting, often projecting a retro-futuristic charm rather than realistic human qualities. Platforms like TikTok have also popularized synthetic voices, like ""Jessie,"" known for her enthusiastic tone. While advanced, these AI voices remain simulations of human speech, designed to ease user discomfort and foster a sense of familiarity. Despite technological progress, AI voices often reinforce traditional stereotypes and serve more to comfort than to genuinely emulate human interaction.",Science and Technology,170,1514
 The Arunachal Times,2024-06-29 00:00:00,Health dept says water sample from Konsa ‘unacceptable’ after PHE’s claim of its safety,"ITANAGAR, 28 Jun: Following the death of two children in Konsa village in Longding district in mid-June after an outbreak of diarrhoea, the health & family welfare department said that some of the water samples showed “unacceptable qualities.”

Two children – a four-year-old and a seven-year-old -died during the outbreak while 20 others, mostly children, fell ill.

While it did not blame unsafe water for the deaths, the health department said that, of the six water samples drawn from public taps around Konsa village, three showed unacceptable quality.

The health department’s statement is in sharp contrast to the claims made by the PHE&WS department.

On 25 June, the Longding PHE&WS division had stated that it conducted a fact-finding inquiry into the diarrhoea outbreak and found that the cases were not related to the quality of drinking water as there were no diarrhoea causing bacteria.

“The team also disinfected the water supply system after collecting the samples. The water samples collected tested negative for presence of any diarrhoea causing bacteria. The water testing of samples done with FTK by a trained woman of the village also tested negative for bacteriological contamination,” the PHE&WS department’s press statement read, adding that water samples from the village had been sent to the state water testing laboratory in Itanagar for confirmation.

The health department said that it remains committed to containing the diarrhoea outbreak and safeguarding community health. “Immediate actions are critical to prevent further fatalities,” it said, and informed that district rapid response teams were formed promptly.

In the aftermath of the outbreak, the Pongchau CHC and the Konnu-based Ayushman health & wellness centre organised a health camp in the village, while the outbreak investigation was led by Longding DSO Dr Neetu Wangsu.

The department further said that the village, which has 95 households, has 75 per cent kutcha-type sanitary toilets.

It further informed that 95 per cent of the affected children were not vaccinated against rotavirus.","In Konsa village, Longding district, an outbreak of diarrhoea resulted in the deaths of two children and illness in 20 others, mostly children. The health department found unacceptable water quality in three out of six samples from public taps, contradicting earlier claims by the PHE&WS department that the outbreak wasn't linked to water quality. Immediate actions are being taken to prevent further fatalities, including forming rapid response teams and organizing health camps.",Health and Wellness,72,323
The Hindu,2024-06-29 00:00:00,Max Verstappen resists Norris attack to win Austrian GP sprint race,"Max Verstappen resisted a spirited attack from Lando Norris on June 29 to claim victory for Red Bull in a feisty sprint race at the Austrian Grand Prix.

The series leader and three-time world champion delivered a home win at the Red Bull Ring with a fighting response after being passed by McLaren’s Norris in the opening laps.

His win was his third sprint triumph this year, his fifth in succession and his 10th in 15 contests as he came home 4.616 seconds ahead of McLaren’s Oscar Piastri and 5.348 clear of Norris, who was unable to maintain his early speed.

“I had a good first lap,” said Verstappen. “But once the DRS (Drag Reduction System) opened it took a few laps for me to get away and then I drove my own race. I had to work for it in that race and we have a few things to think about for tomorrow.”

George Russell finished fourth for Mercedes ahead of Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz and seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton in the second Mercedes. Charles Leclerc in the second Ferrari was seventh.

Sergio Perez came home eighth in the second Red Bull ahead of Haas’s Kevin Magnussen and Lance Stroll of Aston Martin.

Verstappen was given a rousing reception by the massed ranks of his ‘orange army’ in the grandstands, notably roaring with delight when he responded to snatch back his lead from Norris.

On a hot day in the Styrian Alps, Verstappen made a strong start from pole, after two formation laps, to lead through Turn One ahead of Norris with Piastri hustling his team-mate – and Sainz passing Russell for fourth.

The whole grid started on medium tyres, hoping to survive the rising temperatures and complete the distance of 24 laps, reduced to 23, without alarm.

The McLarens stayed in close proximity and threatened not only each other but the leader as they searched for space to pass, all three cars separated by less than six-tenths of a second.

Having made several moves, Norris finally found a way past the Dutchman at the top of the hill on lap five, but Verstappen responded immediately and regained the lead at the next corner allowing Piastri to use his momentum to take second.

Norris, who was feeling unwell before the race, was left struggling to resist the charging Sainz while Piastri set off in pursuit of Verstappen.

By lap eight, the Mercedes were producing a measured helping of pace and this allowed Russell to pass Sainz on the outside of Turn Four for fourth with the help of Drag Reduction System (DRS).

Hamilton, in sixth, closed steadily on Sainz, who clung on while his Ferrari team-mate Leclerc rose from 10th to seventh, but was unable to make any further impression.

At the front, Verstappen relaxed after regaining control and moved out of DRS reach for Piastri who, by lap 15, was looking in his mirrors to see team-mate Norris closing in again. Verstappen led by two seconds.

As it unfolded, it was Verstappen controlling affairs and opening up a gap of more than four seconds as he cruised home before turning his attention to preparations for Grand Prix qualifying taking place later Saturday.","On June 29, Max Verstappen clinched victory for Red Bull at the Austrian Grand Prix sprint race after a fierce battle with Lando Norris. Verstappen, the series leader, recovered from an early pass by Norris to secure his third sprint race win of the year and his fifth consecutive victory. He finished 4.616 seconds ahead of McLaren's Oscar Piastri and 5.348 seconds clear of Norris, who couldn't sustain his initial pace. Verstappen, addressing the race, highlighted the challenge posed by the Drag Reduction System (DRS) and indicated areas for improvement before the upcoming Grand Prix qualifying session.",Sports,97,533

The Indian Express,2024-06-30 00:00:00,T20 World Cup: India end long title drought after final for the ages against South Africa,"Before the clouds over Kensington Oval burst into rain, emotions poured onto the ground. When Hardik Pandya, with South Africa needing 10 off two balls, dismissed Kagiso Rabada, Rohit Sharma’s men couldn’t hold their emotions back.

This was the moment they knew. They wouldn’t care whatever happened after. Their memory would pause at this moment. It was the moment India ended its 13-year wait for a World Cup, this was the hour when they reclaimed the crown of gold they last kissed 17 years ago. And how it was won! In one of the most dramatic T20 finals of all time by a margin of mere seven runs.

Virat Kohli, the batting hero in the most important T20 game of his career, closed his eyes and looked skywards in pure bliss. Rohit Sharma pumped his fists in joy. He might have been emotionally drained but still mustered the bounce and energy to celebrate. Tears rolled down Hardik Pandya’s cheeks; he was the pantomime villain in the build-up to the tournament. Even the picture of restraint, Rahul Dravid, in his last match as head coach, raised his hands. Suryakumar Yadav wrapped his palms over his face, moments after he had plucked one of the greatest catches in World Cup history.
The destinies of Sharma and MS Dhoni met finally. But it was a most nerve-shredding wait. India had to win the final several times, with South Africa refusing to accept it was Rohit’s destiny to get his hands on the trophy, that it was somehow preordained. It will go down as the finest T20 World Cup final ever, the most pulsating one, the drama and pathos of the final stages dizzying and disorienting.
From start to end, the game flowed wickedly, initiative exchanging hands like the fickle weather in the tournament. But the scope for drama seemed to end when Klaasen-led fury whittled the target down to a run-a-ball 30. Sharma threw the last throw of the dice, and reintroduced Jasprit Bumrah. His typical fire-and-brimstone over leaked only four runs, and reminded South Africa that they had to get past him if they were to march towards the podium. Nerves suddenly began to jangle, fear kicked in, panic passed by.
Great balls keep emerging from Bumrah’s stable — the away-swinger to nail Reeza Hendricks earlier could be the ball of the tournament. To describe Bumrah as the world’s greatest all-format bowler is an understatement. He is one bowler in many, unpeeling his masks to his whims. He is a grandmaster in the blitz with the white ball, he sets up batsmen in the twitch of an eyelid, traps them even before they realise they have been trapped. With the new ball, he operates with the precise mastery of a surgeon, in the middle phase, he is the imposing enforcer, flexing his muscles like an angry bouncer in a pub, and at the death, he is the cold-eyed sniper.
When the batsmen negotiate Bumrah, the wiry frame of Arshdeep Singh streams into the eye-line. Everything turns upside down, the angle, pace, release, tricks, bounce, movement. He doesn’t exude the smouldering fear as Bumrah does, but underestimating him is inviting self-harm. His extra degree of movement deceived Aiden Markram, whose attempt to hit on the rise was foiled. And now, he had to ensure that he conceded as few runs as possible in the 19th over. Six accurate balls, the last an inch-perfect wide yorker ensured that South Africa required a formidable 16 runs off the last over.But anything was possible with David Miller around. He almost dragged them back into the game with a meaty clump that almost soared into the sight-screen before Surya intervened. The ball was traversing in a fast and flat trajectory, but just before it crossed the rope, Surya stretched his right hand, while still running. When he realised he would lose balance, he flung the ball as high as possible, gathered his poise, leapt over the rope, returned to the field in time to calmly collect the game.
He has unfurled an array of otherworldly strokes, but it’s the moment that would come to define him forever. South Africa’s last lingering hope was cruelly stubbed. And one could not but empathise with them, in how close they ran India, how close they came to enter the promised land, how near they were to end their history of suffering and heartbreak. But Barbados, where they had lost their first Test upon reintegration in a similar manner, would be their shore or sorrow.But for India, it would be relief, catharsis, even purgation.","India ended a 13-year wait to reclaim the T20 World Cup in a thrilling final, defeating South Africa by seven runs at Kensington Oval. Virat Kohli starred with the bat, while Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh delivered clutch performances with the ball. In a tense final over, Hardik Pandya dismissed Kagiso Rabada, sparking emotional celebrations. Suryakumar Yadav’s incredible boundary catch denied South Africa a crucial six, sealing India’s victory. The game was a rollercoaster of shifting momentum, with South Africa falling agonizingly short. It marked a bittersweet farewell for coach Rahul Dravid and a crowning achievement for Rohit Sharma’s leadership.",Sports,100,763

It is understood that AP had sought time following change of government in the State and resignation of the legal team representing the State before the Brijesh Kumar Tribunal. In its letter addressed to the Tribunal Registrar on Friday, the Chief Engineer (Inter-State Water Resources) of AP stated that on May 15 the Tribunal had given four weeks’ time to both AP and Telangana for filing counters to each other’s Statements of Case and another two weeks thereafter for filing rejoinders and had fixed the next hearing for July 15 and 16. The time given had lapsed on June 11.

Following the Assembly elections in AP, the new government was formed in the second week of June. It has necessitated the officials of the Water Resources Department to give detailed briefing and updates on all issues including pending cases before Tribunals, Supreme Court, National Green Tribunal and others. Further, Advocate on Record for AP Mahfooz A. Nazki tendered his resignation after the Assembly election results.

The State government is in the process of appointment of AoR and the new Advocate General has been appointed following the resignation of the incumbent officer in June third week. The legal team representing AP before the KWDT-II is also being reconstituted. The pleadings on behalf of AP too would have to undergo legal vetting and require appraisal and approval by the new government before filing the counter to SoC filed by Telangana.

The comment from Iran's mission to New York comes with fears of a wider regional war involving Israel and Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement. The two sides have engaged in near-daily exchanges of fire since the war in Gaza began.

Such exchanges have escalated this month, alongside bellicose rhetoric from both sides. Israel's military said plans for a Lebanon offensive had been ""approved and validated"", prompting Hezbollah to respond that none of Israel would be spared in a full-blown conflict.

 Thousands of Iran-backed fighters offer to join Hezbollah in its fight against Israel

In a post on social media platform X, the Iranian mission said it ""deems as psychological warfare the Zionist regime's propaganda about intending to attack Lebanon"".

But, it added, ""should it embark on full-scale military aggression, an obliterating war will ensue. All options, incl. the full involvement of all Resistance Fronts, are on the table.""

The war in Gaza began in October when Hamas Palestinian militants attacked southern Israel.

 In Israel’s north, a slow-burning war is raging with Hezbollah

Iran, which backs Hamas, has praised the attack as a success but has denied any involvement.

Alongside Hezbollah's attacks on northern Israel, Iran-backed rebels in Yemen have repeatedly struck commercial ships in the Red Sea area in what they say are acts of solidarity with the Palestinians.

Iran also backs other groups in the region.

 Hezbollah chief warns archenemy Israel against wider war with Lebanon

The Islamic republic has not recognised Israel since the 1979 revolution that toppled Iran's United States-backed shah.

Fears of regional war also soared in April, after an air strike that levelled Iran's consulate in Damascus and killed seven Revolutionary Guards, two of them generals.

Iran hit back with an unprecedented drone and missile attack on Israel on April 13-14.

Chasing 177 for victory, South Africa needed 30 runs from the final 30 balls with six wickets left and two set batters at the crease, but were restricted to 22 as India showed their experience and bowled with precision to close out the game.

""It is gut-wrenching. That's really what it is,"" Markram told reporters. ""Each player has been on a different individual journey to get to this final. Ultimately, you become really tight as a group and you want good things to happen to this group because you know they're great people.


""When you get really close like that, especially the nature of how the game went, obviously adds to the emotions. It's one of those things but, we can channel it moving forward.""

South Africa had lost seven semi-finals combined in 50- and 20-over World Cups over a period of 32 years before they demolished Afghanistan by nine wickets to set up the decider with India at the Kensington Oval in Barbados.

Markram hoped that this would be the first of more finals to come, in particular when South Africa host the 50-over Cricket World Cup in 2027.

""To get to our first final, it's something we can be proud of (but) still, in our eyes, not good enough. You're not satisfied with making a final,"" he said.


""It will take a bit of time for us to reflect back on all the good things that we've done, but obviously for the time being, it just hurts a lot.

""In hindsight, things will still feel really good about this competition. Just for the time being, it stings a bit, but it's good for it to sting. It gives you that little bit of fire in the belly for the next time that you're here.""","South Africa's captain, Aiden Markram, expressed deep disappointment after their narrow seven-run loss to India in the T20 World Cup final. With South Africa needing 30 runs from the final 30 balls and six wickets in hand, India's disciplined bowling restricted them to just 22 runs, sealing the victory.

Markram described the loss as ""gut-wrenching"" and emphasized the emotional journey each player had taken to reach the final. Despite the disappointment, he sees the experience as galvanizing for the team's future, especially as they aim to build on reaching their first final. Looking ahead, Markram highlighted the upcoming 50-over Cricket World Cup in 2027, expressing optimism and determination for future successes.

The Taliban government, which has imposed restrictions on women since seizing power in 2021 that the U.N. has described as ""gender apartheid"", will send its first delegation to the third round of talks starting in Qatar on June 30.

Civil society representatives, including from women's rights groups, will attend meetings with the international envoys and U.N. officials on July 2, after the official talks.

Rights groups have condemned the exclusion of Afghan women from the main meetings and the lack of human rights issues on the agenda.

The Taliban authorities ""acknowledge the issues about women"", government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told a news conference in Kabul on the eve of the latest talks.

 Women's rights will be raised at UN meeting being attended by Taliban: UN official

""But these issues are Afghanistan's issues,"" said Mujahid, who will lead the delegation.

""We are working to find a logical path toward solutions inside Afghanistan so that, God forbid, our country doesn't again fall into conflict and discord.""

He said the Taliban government would represent all of Afghanistan at the meetings and, given their authority, should be the only Afghans at the table.

""If Afghans participate through several channels, it means we are still scattered, our nation is still not unified,"" he said.

The talks were launched by the U.N. in May 2023 and aim to increase international coordination on engagement with the Taliban authorities, who ousted a Western-backed government when they swept to power.

 UN envoy defends failure to include Afghan women in upcoming meeting with Taliban in Qatar

The Taliban government has not been officially recognised by any state and the international community has wrestled with its approach to Afghanistan's new rulers, with women's rights issues a sticking point for many countries.

Taliban authorities were not invited to the first talks in Doha last year and refused to attend the second conference, demanding that they be the sole Afghan representatives to the exclusion of invited civil society groups.

That condition has been met for the third round.

Mujahid reiterated that the Taliban government sought positive relations with all countries.

However, he added that ""no major or key discussions"" would take place in Doha and that the meeting was an opportunity to exchange views, particularly with Western countries.

The Hindu,2024-06-30 00:00:00,Dignified Rahul Dravid signs off as India coach with World Cup high,"Rahul Dravid's tenure as India head coach, which got a glorious closure with the T20 World Cup triumph here, will remain a case study on how to be stately and understated at the same time in modern-day cricket coaching.

But even 'The Wall' crumbled when emotions took charge at the end of an 11-year long title drought.

As soon as he got a feel of the trophy, which was respectfully brought to him by player of the match Virat Kohli, Dravid let out a roar so ferocious that it seemed he was finally letting out the emotions that he works so hard to hide while in public glare.

It was a moment that was so unlike Dravid, who hardly gave a quote that could fire up the imagination of the headline desk, but remained committed to his job in a rather Gary Kirsten way.

 It's not what we did today but what we did for past 3-4 years: Rohit Sharma after win over South Africa

But that minimalism can never mask the challenges Dravid had to tame during his draining, overwhelming close to three years shepherding the most followed cricket team on this planet.

In fact, the scrutiny of Dravid began even before his appointment as the head coach. He was projected as the 'Next One' while guiding India during a short white ball series against Sri Lanka in mid-2021.

It was his audition -- a real-time interview to see how he would cope with the demands of a high-pressure post -- before he landed the job full-time in November that year.

From the outset, Dravid -- fair or unfair -- had to match up to the lofty legacy of his predecessor Ravi Shastri, under whom India had a fine run including back-to-back away series win in Australia, the Holy Grail of Test cricket for teams from the sub-continent.

While Dravid never got a chance to tour Down Under as a coach, he tamed the Antipodeans at home in different formats.

But a defeat and a drawn Test series against a 'weaker' South African side will rankle Dravid, for whom wins away from home always stood as the gold standard.

These are the routine obstacles that are endured by any coach. But Dravid had to face harsher tests which were unique to the Indian cricketing culture.

He was managing a dressing room full of superstars, an environment he was not very unfamiliar with from his playing days.

 From President Murmu to Rahul Gandhi, leaders extend heartiest congratulations to Team India after World Cup triumph

And he was well aware that even the slightest discord would be blown out of proportions.

Rewind to the exit saga of Anil Kumble's tenure and eventual ouster.

But Dravid had this priceless ability to gauge people and situations, and he channelised that into his coaching stint.

He put in place his methods without trying to dismantle the existing system, creating a balanced atmosphere with captain Rohit Sharma for players to excel.

Mohammed Siraj is a telling example. The pacer began his journey during the regime of Shastri, but flowered into an all-format bowler under the tutelage of Dravid.

However, he did not always have calm seas to navigate.

To begin with, three frontline batters -- Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane and Cheteshwar Pujara -- were gradually slipping out of the hot zone.

Kohli, who was always going to get the longer end of the rope, made Dravid's job easier, regaining some of his scoring ways but the other two reached their sell-by date as top-flight batters.

Their failure to deliver in the World Test Championship final against Australia in London last year hastened their walk towards the exit gate.

But Pujara and Rahane were the bulwarks of the Indian middle-order for long and the transition process had to be delicately dealt with.

Here Dravid leaned on his immense experience of working with players during the 'A' tours and other such developmental stages.

Realising the enormity of his task early, Dravid handed Shreyas Iyer a debut in his first Test series as coach -- against New Zealand at home.

Iyer did not disappoint him either, making a hundred. Ironically, Iyer along with Ishan Kishan, two cricketers in whom Dravid invested heavily, were in the eye of a storm later, eventually leading to the duo missing a BCCI central contract.

Oddities apart, Dravid's way was not really flawed, and he extended it to the ODIs too, where he focused on building a wider pool of young players.

It was a trait Dravid developed from his captaincy days when the Bengaluru man and then coach Greg Chappell tried out several young players like Suresh Raina, Y Venugopala Rao, and Rudra Pratap Singh with varying degree of success.

Dravid adopted a similar strategy alongside Rohit, pushing forward talents like Shubman Gill, Kishan, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Siraj and Suryakumar Yadav, who had to wait for consistent chances under the previous dispensation.

They vindicated the faith placed on them while carrying India to the Asia Cup title in Sri Lanka last year, where Gill and Siraj topped India's batting and bowling charts respectively.

However, in the deepest corners of his mind Dravid will rue the missed chance of winning the 50-over World Cup at home after his side succumbed to Australia in the final.

The World Cup win at Barbados might have eased that pain considerably, but it, surprisingly, came in a format where Dravid, much against his schtick, largely followed the conventional path.

This is not to say that Dravid was out of sync with this format as demonstrated on Saturday.

So, how will Dravid's coaching stint be remembered? The World Cup victory will certainly occupy a large chunk of the public memory space.

However, above that, the flawless handling of a team of high-profile individuals will be the legacy for his successor to live up to. It's daunting too.

","Rahul Dravid's tenure as India's head coach culminated with a triumphant T20 World Cup victory, marking a case study in balanced and understated coaching. Despite his typically composed demeanor, Dravid displayed rare emotion upon winning the title, underscoring the challenges he faced managing a team of cricketing superstars amidst high expectations. His legacy includes nurturing young talent like Mohammed Siraj and overseeing a transition phase for seasoned players like Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, and Cheteshwar Pujara. Dravid's success in building team cohesion and guiding India to significant victories will define his coaching legacy, overshadowing occasional controversies and near misses in other formats.",Sports,102,995
The Hindu,2024-06-30 00:00:00,The immortal lines,"To understand the human condition, we go back to memorable lines from poets which have stood the test of time with their truth and relevance. Any situation or event can trigger in us a sense of deja vu, and lines that lie in the synapses of memory spring to mind.

While we are familiar with the titans of literature, there are many less-renowned authors whose lines we quote without being aware of them, their names not up for a quick recall.

Thomas Gray, the precursor of the Romantics, has written one of the most-loved, oft-quoted poems in the English language, Elegy written in a country churchyard, full of wistful melancholy and a reflection on the transience of life.

The lines “Full many a gem of purest ray serene/ The dark unfathomed caves of ocean bear...” tell us of unacknowledged genius in obscure corners, those who lived faithfully quiet lives and rest in unvisited tombs. The line “The paths of glory lead but to the grave” is a gentle reminder of our mortality.

Shakespeare, the ultimate wordsmith, had immortal lines on every conceivable vicissitude of life and dominated his age and time, his contemporaries largely living in his shadow. Yet, when we need to describe the mesmerising beauty of a woman, we turn to Christopher Marlowe’s “mighty line”, “Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burned the topless towers of Ilium... Oh thou art fairer than the evening air clad in the beauty of a thousand stars”. These lines bestow bounteous praise with an overwhelming emotion on an object of beauty.

Then there is Ode by Arthur O’Shaughnessy in which a chorus of artists, poets and dreamers, “the movers and shakers of this world”, envision a new world heralding a change in the existing order. Many may have lost the battle but the vision endures in its glorious effort.

William Johnson Cory, a schoolmaster at Eton threw light on the enduring legacy of friendship and loss: “They told me Heraclitus, they told me you were dead/ They brought me bitter news to hear and bitter tears to shed/ I wept as I remembered how often you and I/ have tired the sun with talking and sent him down the sky”.

Heraclitus was an ancient Greek poet on whose death his friend Callimachus wrote an elegy. Cory’s is its English version. Grief often brings us to this poem.

Edwin Markham, an American poet, inspired by the painting of Jean Francois Millet, wrote Man with the Hoe on the plight of the peasant, a sad miserable figure burdened with work, with little empathy from his fellow beings. “The emptiness of ages in his face/ and on his back the burden of the world”. The most telling line in the poem is “Time’s tragedy is in that aching stoop”.

The poet’s anguished cry is an invocation to the world: “Oh masters, lords and rulers in all lands/ How will the future reckon with this man/ How answer his brute question in that hour/ when whirlwinds of rebellion are let loose?” At once an appeal and interrogation of the world’s conscience, it addresses itself even today to the humanitarian crises looming large around us.

The poem was called by philosopher, peace activist and novelist Jay William Hudson “the battle cry of the next thousand years”.

The famous nursery rhyme Twinkle, twinkle little star by Jane Wyman, handed down generations, has gladdened the hearts of countless children. The poem runs through four stanzas, though the first is the most memorable.

The little star epitomises the Socratic wonder of every child at the mystery of the universe. The poem has lent itself to several adaptations, translations, musical scores and even a parody by the Mad Hatter in Alice in Wonderland.

So much for these lines that have been canonised by the hearts and voices of countless people.","This text reflects on the enduring impact of lesser-known poets and their memorable lines, alongside more famous works like Thomas Gray's ""Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard,"" Shakespeare's evocative verses, and Arthur O'Shaughnessy's ode celebrating artists and dreamers. It highlights the emotional depth and societal critique found in these poems, resonating across generations and inspiring reflection on human conditions such as mortality, beauty, friendship, labor, and wonder.",Human Interest,67,643

“If a state's name is not mentioned in Budget speech, it doesn't mean that no money is given to them,” said Nirmala Sitharaman.Recalling that the UPA government budgets also did not mention names of all states in their Budget speech, Sitharaman said that she has been picking up on Budget speeches since 2004-2005, 2005-2006, 2006-2007, 2007-2008 and so on.

""The Budget of 2004-2005 did not take the name of 17 states. I would like to ask the members of the UPA government at that time - did money not go to those 17 states? Did they stop it? If they have stopped it, then they have every business to raise questions,” asked the Finance Minister.— I would like to thank every member of the House who has spoken and taken interest in the Budget which has been presented here. I would like to thank the people of the country for giving this govt headed by PM Modi, a historic third consecutive term in office.

— We shall all work to build Viksit Bharat by the year 2047. The Budget 2024 is the first step towards Viksit Bharat.

— India is the fastest growing economy; has overcome after-effects of pandemic due to capex push.

— Government is complying with the fiscal deficit trajectory. It will bring down the deficit to below 4.5 per cent by 2025-26 from the targeted 4.9 per cent for the current fiscal. The deficit was 5.6 per cent in 2023-24.

— FY25 Budget has not given lesser allocation to any sector compared to last year.

— No state is being denied any money. We are not depriving any state.


— Unemployment rate, for age group of 15-59 years has actually come down for J&K, from 6.4% in 2020-21 to 5.7% in 2021-22 to 4.4% in 2022-23.

— We have provided substantial financial support of ₹17,000 crore in the Union Budget of UT Jammu and Kashmir this year. It includes ₹12,000 crore towards financing the cost of Jammu and Kashmir Police.

— Agriculture had 0.30 lakh crore in 2013-14, whereas now it has 1.52 lakh crore. It is 8,000 crores more than last year, which is 2023-24. Education and employment had 0.85 lakh crore allotted in 2013-14, whereas today it is 1.48 lakh crore, 23% more allocation.



— The Budget allocation for the department of agriculture and farmers' welfare was only ₹21,934 crore in 2013-2014. However, in 2024-2025, it has increased to ₹1.23 lakh crore. There's a five times increase. More than ₹3.2 lakh crore have been disbursed to over 11 crore farmers under PM Kisan since its launch

The Hindu,2024-06-30 00:00:00,Endemic dengue may have helped stem severity of early COVID wave in India: study,"Can the dengue virus beat the coronavirus and is it why the early wave of the pandemic in 2020 resulted in fewer COVID deaths or severe infections compared to Europe or North America where dengue is not endemic? Research from the CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata hints at these intriguing possibilities following an analysis of antibodies from people infected with dengue and testing them against a kind of coronavirus called murine hepatitis virus (mouse coronavirus). In research settings, this virus — being part of the same family of human coronaviruses — is considered a good surrogate to study the behaviour of the coronavirus strains that infected people during the pandemic.

Their results, published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Medical Virology this week, suggest that the antibodies following a dengue infection were able to ‘neutralise’ these coronavirus. For their analysis, the scientists relied on a combination of computer-modelling studies as well as cell-culture studies, the latter demonstrating how antibodies from dengue were able to engulf and bind the coronavirus proteins.

However, this protective effect did not necessarily expand to all coronavirus variants.

These latest studies build on the lab’s work from 2020 that blood tests specific to check for dengue sometimes led to a positive SARS-CoV-2 test.

“We experimentally demonstrated that serum samples from dengue patients have the potential to bind to and “mask” the surface of several coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. We performed “virus neutralization” tests in cell cultures and showed that such “masking” by dengue antibodies can indeed, block coronavirus entry into susceptible cells,” Dr. Subhajit Biswas, Principal Scientist and the main author of the study, told The Hindu.

The dengue family of viruses are different from the coronavirus family and hence infection from one, in normal circumstances, is not expected to protect against the other. What is known about dengue is that there are four major serotypes, or strains, that cause dengue infections. Strains Denv-1 and Denv-2 are the most common in India. However, being infected with one does not protect against the other and, in fact, a re-infection involving a different strain can be more dangerous — a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in dengue. Whether the prevalence of dengue in dengue-endemic countries of Southeast Asia may be triggering newer mutations in the coronavirus is a factor that needs to be investigated more extensively, the authors suggest in their study.

That the early stages of the pandemic saw a decline in dengue in India has been independently reported. The National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme of India reported a sharp decline of 75% (39,419 versus 1,57,315) in dengue incidence during 2020 as compared with 2019. “The possible reasons for this reduction could be lower transmission of the vector, less exposure due to COVID-19 lockdown, and, potentially, a disparity in the reported data possibly due to underdiagnosis or underreporting because of increased attention to the COVID-19 pandemic,” said a 2021 study in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygeine.

“In this paper, we provided several pieces of experimentally obtained evidence that pre-existing dengue immunity might have played some protective role in reducing the COVID severity and mortality in dengue-prone regions like Southeast Asia compared to regions where dengue does not occur frequently, like Europe and North America. Perhaps this is why, historically, human coronaviruses have been rarely encountered as a causative agent of “severe acute respiratory infections, SARI” from India, highly endemic for dengue virus,” he added.

The dilemma was whether the cross-reactive antibodies would provide partial protection against severe dengue infection or lead to increased severity due to the well-known phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement seen in dengue.  We hypothesize that the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 might decrease the severity of dengue. Larger multicentric clinical studies or population data from dengue endemic regions might help in understanding the existence of the cross-reactive, cross-protective association between these two single-stranded, positively coiled +SS RNA viruses.","Research from the CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology suggests that antibodies produced after dengue infection may neutralize certain coronavirus strains, potentially influencing COVID-19 severity. This effect may have contributed to lower COVID-19 severity in dengue-endemic regions like Southeast Asia compared to non-endemic areas. The interaction between dengue and coronavirus antibodies requires further investigation to understand its implications fully.",Health and Wellness,58,647
Hindustan Times,2024-06-30 00:00:00,From Maharaj's charan seva to Animal's 'lick my shoe': Most controversial Bollywood scenes in recent times,"Aamir Khan's son Junaid Khan, marked his acting debut with direct-to-OTT release Maharaj. While Junaid has received palpable attention for his turn as 19th century social reformer Karsandas Mulji, much of the headlines Maharaj has been making, has been in lieu of what now appears to be a somewhat 'controversial' plot. The film's initial release set for June 14 stood delayed by a week owing to it being temporarily halted by the Gujarat High Court. The reason? A petition from members of the Vaishnavite Pustimargi sect, who anticipated the film to disrespect their religious sentiments. Since the film's release however, everything about it appears to have taken a backseat in the face of the 'charan seva' scene, featuring Jaideep Ahlawat and Shalini Pandey. Let's take a look at this, as well as some other scenes in recent Bollywood history which have garnered a similar response.

Maharaj's charan seva scene
Shalini Pandey starred as Kishori in Malhotra P Siddharth's Maharaj. Conversely, Jaane Jaan actor Jaideep Ahlawat played the titular role of Maharaj. A scene in the film which has now gained immense traction, sees Shalini's Kishori being exploited by Jaideep's Maharaj as she performs charan seva. The practice itself being portrayed on screen, not a figment of imagination, has left many uncomfortable. Opening up about the same, Shalini recently shared how the actual impact of what that scene signified hit her much later. She recalls wanting to not be in closed rooms, needing fresh air and dealing with a nagging anxious feeling. She also revealed how prior to shooting the difficult scene she saw her own character as rather stupid, falling for the setup. However, she eventually got around to understanding how Kishori simply did not know any better and for long had been conditioned to think and act a certain way.

Animal's 'lick my shoe' scene
The Ranbir Kapoor-starrer Animal smashed multiple box office records emerging as one of the most successful releases of 2023. These mean feats however, did not takeaway from how problematic the film was deemed by most, start to finish. Animal of course found its supporters who advocated that it was 'just a film' and a thoroughly-gripping one at that. However, many were of the opinion that director Sandeep Reddy Vanga added an undeniable layer of heroism to the patriarchal, misogynistic and repeatedly objectifying character essayed by Ranbir. A particular scene which gripped audiences — yet again for all the wrong reasons, was when Ranbir's Ranvijay asks Triptii Dimri's Zoya to lick his shoe in order to prove her loyalty to him, considering the fact that she came out as a mole in the previous scene. Difficult to digest, the scene easily makes for one of the most criticised segments in the film.
Kabir Singh's slap scene
Vanga and controversy go hand-in-hand and admittedly, the director would have it no other way. That is probably the reason why not one, but two of his films find their names on this list. Kabir Singh (2019) essentially gave a new lease of life to Shahid Kapoor's acting career and shot Kiara Advani into the big leagues. The film though loved my many, much like Animal has a dedicated base of critics. A scene in the film shows a raging Kabir slap Preeti as he feels she is simply not as committed to the idea of marrying him against all odds, the way he is. Not just this scene, all of Kabir Singh was immensely criticised for seemingly glorifying male chauvinistic behaviour. It is worth mentioning however, that the criticism did not stop it from raking in formidable numbers at the box office.
Padmaavat's jauhar scene
Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Padmaavat (2018) was wrangling with one controversy after another right since its inception. Following legal entanglements, vandalised sets and a significant tweak in the title, the Deepika Paukone and Ranveer Singh-starrer, also featuring Shahid Kapoor and Jim Sarbh, finally released in January 2018. The climax of the film however opened yet another Pandora's Box as Deepika's Rani Padmavati, along with the hundreds of women in the palace, commit ‘jauhar’ — or self-emmolation, to escape falling in the hands of Ranveer's Alauddin Khilji. Those critiquing this scene pressed on the depiction of women being objectified as the repository of 'honour' as men go to war, a sentiment which manages to seamlessly find modern-day manifestations. The sense of triumph portrayed in the scene by Bhansali, is what appears to have got the goat of many.
Udta Punjab's drug use scene
The third Shahid Kapoor-starrer in this list, Abhishek Chaubey's Udta Punjab (2016) made for a hard-hitting saga on the ravaging impact of drug abuse in the state of Punjab. A particularly graphic scene in question shows Shahid Kapoor's Tommy Singh feed his cocaine addiction. At the time of the film's release, which as it is found itself in a world of back-and-forth owing to censorship woes, the drug abuse montages were labelled as way too raw by many. Many however, also argued that the graphic nature of the montages were needed to effectively get the message across.
Certain problematic scenes, irrespective of if they are labelled as such, unanimously or not, may actually be central to the film or series' plot. That being said, there is a certain sense of responsibility and accountability that comes with being in the trade of making movies, particularly with regards to the type of impact and influence, content can have on audiences. Does that however mean, that the potential for creative reign in the industry is dead?","The recent controversy surrounding Junaid Khan's debut in ""Maharaj"" highlights a recurring issue in Bollywood: contentious scenes that provoke strong reactions. From Animal's shoe-licking demand to Kabir Singh's infamous slap, and Padmaavat's jauhar, these scenes often spark debate over their portrayal of sensitive topics like misogyny, historical events, and drug abuse. Despite criticisms, these scenes underscore filmmakers' choice to push boundaries, questioning whether creative freedom should be curtailed for social responsibility in cinema. This ongoing tension reflects Bollywood's complex relationship with cultural representation and audience impact.",Entertainment,86,921

The capital saw very light, scattered rain on Saturday, but the capital remained on an orange alert until Tuesday.

According to the IMD, no significant rainfall was observed on Sunday until 8.30. After the monsoon entered the capital and brought the city to a halt with the heaviest downpour (228.1 mm) in 88 years for June on Friday, the IMD warned of moderate to heavy rain on Sunday and heavy rain for the next two days.

After a steady decline in temperature since June 24, from 40.4 degrees Celsius to 32.5 degrees Celsius on Friday, the temperature climbed back up on Saturday to near-normal levels. The maximum temperature in Delhi rose to 35.6 degrees Celsius on Saturday while the minimum temperature climbed to 28 degrees Celsius, both close to the normal values – 37.2 degrees Celsius and 27.9 degrees Celsius, respectively. The humidity level saw a maximum of 97 per cent on Saturday.

The minimum temperature recorded on Sunday at the Safdarjung base station was 27 degrees Celsius, slightly below the normal value.

In its advisory during the orange alert period, the IMD has asked people to check for traffic congestion, avoid waterlogged areas, and stay away from power lines or electrical wires. It has also advised people to stay indoors and avoid travel in its impact-based Delhi-NCR forecast.

Recent satellite imagery detected a very likely possibility of light to moderate rain in many places, including an intense spell at a few places, along with isolated thunderstorms, gusty winds, and cloud-to-ground lightning for the next three hours in several places, including nearby places to Delhi such as Punjab, adjoining Himachal Pradesh, and east Uttar Pradesh, the Met office posted on X at 8.43 am.

The IMD recognises three types of lightning: intra cloud, cloud to cloud, and cloud to ground. It says the third is the most dangerous kind.

On Saturday, IMD officials said active monsoon conditions will likely persist over Northwest India for the next five days, while peninsular India experienced reduced rainfall activity except in a few places.

According to a press release by the IMD on Saturday, heavy to very heavy rain will likely occur over Northwest and Northeast India over the next four to five days.

The Hindu,2024-06-30 00:00:00,Mongolia ruling party wins reduced majority in vote dominated by graft,"Mongolia's ruling party emerged from this week's polls with its parliamentary majority significantly diminished on June 29, local media said, after a campaign dominated by graft fears and the state of the economy.

Prime Minister Luvsannamsrain Oyun-Erdene declared victory early on June 29 morning in the previous day's polls, in which millions of Mongolians turned out to elect 126 members of the State Great Khural, the country's unicameral parliament.

Local media outlet Ikon, collating figures provided by the General Election Commission, reported that the ruling Mongolian People's Party (MPP) had won 68 seats, giving it a majority of four.

The main opposition Democratic Party won 42, Ikon reported, while the minor anti-corruption HUN party won eight. Smaller parties won eight seats between them.

The head of the Electoral Commission said on June 29 afternoon there remained some votes to be counted by hand to verify results collated by machines.

""Only six to seven polling stations are remaining, but the hand counting matches the machines 100%,"" he told a news conference in the capital Ulaanbaatar.

""These polling stations will be finished very soon,"" he said.

The results — the first under a new electoral system in which Mongolians vote for both proportional lists and individuals representing large districts — mean the MPP will govern with a greatly reduced majority.

‘Rebuke’
The new parliament will see the MPP hold 54% of the seats, compared to around 80% in 2020.

""This election result definitely represents a rebuke to MPP and the entirety of its leadership,"" Bayarlkhagva Munkhnaran, an analyst and former official with the National Security Council of Mongolia, told AFP.

Winning 68 seats is ""barely a face-saver and any subsequent government will be a weak but much more democratic one"", he said.

""The biggest winners are Mongolian people who resolutely hit the polling stations and confirmed their unequivocal support for a democratic path.""

Analysts had expected the MPP to retain the majority it has enjoyed since 2016 and govern for another four years.

They say the party can credit much of its success to a boom in coal mining that fuelled double-digit growth and dramatically improved standards of living, as well as to a formidable party machine.

However, the campaign was dominated by deep public frustration over endemic corruption, as well as the high cost of living.

There is also a widespread belief that the proceeds of the coal-mining boom are being hoarded by a wealthy elite — a view that has sparked frequent protests.

‘Life hasn’t changed’
On the streets of Ulaanbaatar, 25-year-old Myagmariin Dulguun, a tattooed bartender, told AFP he had taken part in those protests and was ""not happy at all"" with the election result.

""I didn't expect the MPP to win, everyone around me was against them,"" he said.

""We need political reform. We need to do more protests.""

Another key issue was the lack of opportunities for young people, who make up almost two-thirds of the population.

Many feel unrepresented by Mongolia's politicians, which has fuelled a rise in minor, liberal parties that directly target urban youth.

First-time voter Oyuntsetseg Khaliun, 19, told AFP she had supported the Civil Will-Green Party, which won four seats.

The Hindu,2024-06-30 00:00:00,"Nearly 100 teaching, non-teaching staff across various TISS campuses fired","In what came as a shock to nearly 100 teaching and non-teaching staff at various campuses of Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) across India, they were informed that their contracts will not be renewed and their services end on June 30.

On June 28, the TISS administrations sent termination letters to the staff.

“Nearly a hundred institute staff members which were previously funded by the Tata Education Trust will become unemployed after years of service at TISS. It is completely a failure of the current leadership of TISS administration in running the institute and apathy of the BJP-led Union government,” said a statement by Progressive Students’ Forum of TISS.

“After repeatedly targeting its students and curbing the campus democracy, the present TISS administration, under the BJP-led Union government, has unleashed an attack on its employees as well,” the statement further said.

The mass termination is set to create a scarcity of teaching and non-teaching staff. “As students, we express our concern about this decision. The previous years’ NIRF data shows that the student-faculty ratio is being impacted negatively. This means that the currently employed faculty is insufficient in terms of the number of students admitted to TISS each year,” the statement said.

While the termination of a hundred such positions will directly impact the futures of the students who are enrolling in the Institute, it might also allow for politically-motivated appointments in the near future, the students feared.

TISS, a premier institute in existence for nearly 90 years, through the contribution of its faculty and staff has achieved a distinct status as a social science institute. Last year, the BJP-led Centre took over TISS, making it a fully ‘public-funded institute’.

“The result has been that students are facing delays in receiving student aid and are being threatened in the name of fee payment. While becoming a public institute should have relieved the pressure from students coming from economically and socially marginalised backgrounds, the Central government takeover has resulted in added monetary pressures,” the statement added.

The latest move of robbing around 100 teaching and non-teaching staff at the institute of their jobs highlights the BJP government’s ‘anti-education’ and ‘anti-TISS’ stance, the students have alleged.

“The BJP-led Central government and the current TISS administration are directly responsible for taking away the livelihoods of nearly a hundred employees and putting the future of its students also at risk. The recent blunders made by the Ministry of Education in conducting nationwide entrance examinations only add to the incompetence of the Central government,” the statement said.

The Progressive Students’ Forum has demanded that the TISS administration immediately revoke the mass termination and make necessary arrangements with the Union government and the University Grants Commission (UGC) to take responsibility for those previously employed under the Tata Education Trust.

The Forum has also demanded that alternatively, the government must hold urgent discussions with the top management of the Tata Education Trust to reinstate funding for these positions so that all jobs are protected.","TISS has terminated contracts for nearly 100 teaching and non-teaching staff previously funded by Tata Education Trust, citing financial constraints after becoming fully public-funded under the BJP-led government.

Alternative for Germany, or AfD, took 15.9% of the vote to finish second in the European Parliament election on June 9, despite recent scandals and setbacks. That was lower than its support in surveys at the beginning of the year, but a particularly strong performance in the formerly communist east has bolstered its hopes of emerging as the strongest party in three state elections there in September.

EDITORIAL | Right turn: On the European Parliament elections

At the regular two-day convention in the western city of Essen, co-leaders Alice Weidel and Tino Chrupalla were elected unopposed to new two-year terms. They were backed by 79.8% and 82.7% of delegates respectively — a display of harmony by the party's often-argumentative standards.

Weidel vowed to work to “tear down the unspeakable so-called firewalls” that other parties have set up against working with AfD.

A heavy police presence was in place in Essen, where local authorities had tried to find a way to prevent the AfD event but lost their case in court. Regional authorities estimated that about 20,000 people took part in a march as the meeting took place, German news agency dpa reported, while thousands attended other protest events.

Early Saturday morning, a group of demonstrators tried to get through a barrier and was pushed back by police using pepper spray and batons. There were also incidents in which masked demonstrators attacked officers, according to police, who reported “several” arrests.

Protesters staged sit-ins on streets and crossings near the convention hall.

Weidel told delegates as she opened the meeting that “what is going on out there has nothing to do with democracy"" and said that “we are here and we will stay.”

AfD's recent setbacks included the party sidelining its top two candidates from the election campaign due to scandals and being kicked out of its hard-right group in the European Parliament.

Brilliant bowling at the death from pacers Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh and a breathtaking catch on the boundary by Suryakumar Yadav in the last over turned the game around for the champions after they were down and almost out after 15 overs — South Africa needed 30 at run-a-ball with six wickets in hand and looked set to hunt down India’s 176 for 7.Bumrah conceded four runs in the 16th over and just two in the 18th which also fetched the wicket of Marco Jansen while Arshdeep gave away four in the penultimate over to tighten the screws. Then, with South Africa needing 16 runs off the last over bowled by Hardik Pandya, SKY turned a certain six into a controlled catch to get rid of the dangerous David Miller (21) and put the opposition on the mat. They could not get up and eventually limped to 169 for 8.

Heinrich Klaasen had taken the game away with his 27-ball 52 before India pulled it back. Quinton de Kock (39) and Tristan Stubbs (31) were the other run-getters for South Africa, who will continue to carry the ‘Chokers’ tag that has been around their necks for a long time.

Earlier, India posted the highest total in a T20 World Cup final thanks to a steady 76 by opener Virat Kohli, a valuable 47 from Axar Patel and their innings-stabilising 72-run partnership for the fourth wicket after the team had slipped to 34 for 3 in the fifth over.

They began well though. Kohli drove on either side of the wicket to pick three boundaries in the first over bowled by left-arm pacer Jansen as the Blues took 15 off the opening over.

From the other end, Rohit cut and reverse swept Keshav Maharaj for successive boundaries but was out, caught brilliantly by Klaasen at square leg as he tried to sweep the left-arm spinner. India 23 for 1. Two balls later, Rishabh Pant fell for a duck, top edging Keshav Maharaj to de Kock behind the stumps. Another brilliant catch by Klaasen, running to his left at fine leg, saw the departure of Suryakumar Yadav (3) and put India in trouble.At the end of Powerplay, India were 45 for 3, their slowest since the Super Eight stage in the tournament.

India’s 50 came up in the eighth over, in 43 balls and included seven fours. Soon, Axar Patel lifted Markram into the stands for the first six of the game. Next over, he carted Maharaj out of the ground.

Axar also brought up India’s 100, with a six over long-on off pacer Kagiso Rabada on the first ball of an eventful 14th over, in which he got run out courtesy a direct hit at the non-striker’s end by wicket-keeper de Kock. Axar’s 31-ball innings was decorated with four sixes and a boundary.

Next man Shivam Dube did not let the wicket affect him, launching Jansen into the stands. He then stung Shamsi to the midwicket boundary. The left-hander contributed a quick 27 to the total and was involved in a 57-run stand for the fifth wicket with Kohli.Kohli got to his half-century in 48 balls with just four boundaries. Soon, he upped the tempo, hitting Rabada for a six and a four in the 18th over. The former captain was out in the penultimate over while trying to hit Jansen out of the ground, only for Rabada to pull off the catch on the boundary.

Dube followed his long-standing partner with two balls left in the innings, caught by David Miller off pacer Anrich Nortje, who was the best South African bowler on show with 2 for 26 from his four overs. It was not enough.

 ","India clinched the T20 World Cup with a thrilling seven-run victory over South Africa in Barbados. Virat Kohli's 76 and Axar Patel's 47 powered India to 176/7.

It was India's second T20 World Cup victory after they had won it in 2007 under the legendary MS Dhoni in South Africa, and first since winning the Champions Trophy in 2013.

Star batter Virat Kohli, who was an upcoming cricketer 17 years ago, made his first fifty of this tournament in the final — a classy 76 off 59 balls with six fours and two sixes that carried India to a competitive 176 for seven.

Then the Indian bowlers, led by Arshdeep Singh (2/20) and Jasprit Bumrah (2/18), worked their magic as they did throughout this tournament, limiting South Africa to 169 for eight to propel India to their second T20 World Cup.

There were pockets of fight from the Proteas, who were playing in their maiden World Cup final.

Heinrich Klaasen threatened India with a 52 off 27 balls (2x4, 5x6) but Hardik Pandya (3/20) snatched the crucial wicket to bring the game decisively in favour of India.

But a large chunk of the credit should go to Kohli for anchoring the innings and pushing India to a fighting total.

He completed his fifty in 48 balls, but the knock was what precisely India needed the early dismissals of skipper Rohit Sharma (9), Rishabh Pant (0) and Suryakumar Yadav (3), which had reduced India to a worrying 34 for three.

However, Kohli had an able partner in Axar Patel (47, 31 balls, 1x4, 6x4) during the fourth wicket alliance that produced precious 72 runs to ease the early nerves.

After the run-out of Axar, who took on SA bowlers bravely, another left-hander Shivam Dube (27 off 16 balls, 3x4 1x6) gave some late steam to Indian innings.

To conduct the study, published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science, the researchers followed three cohorts of university students over three years, collecting data on their social interactions and momentary well-being.
“Our research indicates that engaging in meaningful social interactions has net positive outcomes for affective well-being, stress, and loneliness,” said lead author Mahnaz Roshanaei, of Stanford University.

“Spending more time in substantive and deep conversations with anyone with either strong or weak ties, results in benefits for the average person’s well-being outcomes,” she added.

The study found greater benefits for well-being when meaningful social interactions happened in person (or face-to-face), compared to other communication channels like direct messaging and texting.

Meaningful social interactions while resting resulted in higher well-being than those occurring during activities such as studying or dining.

The researchers acknowledged that their study had limitations, including the fact that it focused on university students and may not be generalisable to the general population or outside of the US.

The Hindu,2024-06-30 00:00:00,Tuning into classical music,"“People love what other people are passionate about.” I had grossly underestimated the extent to which such passion might cause a transformation in one.

Joining the underrated and niche classical arts club in university, I immediately found my haven.

The people were introverted much like me and shared a common appreciation for culture and tradition. They were extremely devoted to, and passionate about, classical music and dance. Having learnt Carnatic music since the age of eight, I was expected to be a decent enough vocalist, that is, had I not treated music completely as a hobby, and confined my practice sessions to the 15-minute drive to my music class.

But there was also a deeper problem. Though I respected classical music, I was not exposed to the brilliance and dynamic nature of the art form. It seemed archaic, rigid and quite often, distant.

In college, my first experience in the club was a live Carnatic concert by Ramkrishnan Murthy. It was my first concert, and it blew my mind. I obsessively recorded videos and shared them with my mother and sister. I was amazed by the beauty of the compositions, their presentation, and how there was room for creativity and improvisation. The club hosted jamming sessions, called Baithaks, which allowed me to admire classical music in its entirety.

My perception was completely overturned as I listened in awe to instruments such as the harmonium, tabla, flute, violin and sitar blending harmoniously with the honey-sweet, crystal-clear voices of some of the most talented singers. I immensely enjoyed having elaborate discussions about the nature of Ragas or anecdotes about composers. Slowly my Spotify playlists started having more thumris, and thillanas than trap or pop. From turning off the radio before the AIR Akashvani instrumental programmes could start to searching for lengthy instrumental pieces, my interests had taken a complete 180-degree turn. I began to notice the development arc in my friends and fellow music enthusiasts in the club too, some of whom had barely any exposure to classical music apart from Kishore Kumar or Lata Mangeshkar. I saw them pick up the harmonium and tabla and later even go on to give small performances in festivals on campus.

After a year in the club, I found myself in its coordinating committee. This position gave me access to artists and professionals in the field of classical arts. I helped organise the next annual concert with much enthusiasm. I had only one motto as the coordinator: to make classical arts accessible to all and to change the archaic perception people had towards classical. Through the club, I could connect with the classical arts clubs of other universities, drawing inspiration from them and closely following up on competitions, concerts, fest performances and even purely classical events like Thyagaraja Aradhana.

By the time my tenure ended, the club had become larger than life. The classical artforms felt no longer confined by rules, but something that flowed naturally. And I believed that its future rested in the hands of the young.

Another factor that played a huge role was social media. In the content age, the only way to sustain a dying artform is to produce more of it, and the most authentic version of it. Thanks to social media, professional classical musicians and dancers are able to expand their audience and reach to the masses that have never experienced the taste of classical arts. Once they begin to explore the artforms, the algorithm takes care of keeping them engaged. Similarly, students of classical music and dance have found it easier to stay in touch with their art through online courses and self-learning tutorials. Classical arts education is no longer a thing of privilege, nor is it exclusive of technical education.

My lifestyle has changed since my induction into the club. I now hunt for classical concerts in my city. I have started teaching myself Bharatnatyam, the first artform I had fallen in love with at five, and while my guilty pleasure remains scrolling Instagram reels, I am happier when beautifully choreographed thirty-second pieces of Bharatnatyam or Kathak appear in my feed.","The narrator's journey into a university classical arts club transforms their perception of classical music and dance, initially seen as archaic and distant. Exposure to live performances and discussions within the club sparks a deep appreciation, leading to involvement in coordinating events and promoting classical arts' accessibility and relevance through social media. This newfound passion also inspires personal growth and pursuit of Bharatnatyam alongside an active engagement in classical arts events.",Entertainment,71,685
indian express,2024-06-30 00:00:00,Express View on T20 World Cup: India’s victory is a just reward for the hard work of the last two years,"When Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma cradled Rahul Dravid in their arms and enlisted their team-mates to joyously flip him in the air, on the Barbados pitch where their contrasting journeys culminated in an epic climax, the circle of joy felt complete. Dravid, whose greatest blight as an India captain happened in the Caribbean in 2007, was seeking redemption in his last game as India coach on the same shores. Sharma, whose international career took its own sweet time to warm up, needed this T20 triumph to join the pantheons of great leaders that includes Kapil Dev and MS Dhoni. This was his last T20 international and it’s unlikely he will be fit and around for the 2027 ODI World Cup. Kohli, who had had a disappointing T20 World Cup — his last too — puffed out his chest in the final. The match will stay in the minds of all three for years to come.

Seldom has an acutely self-conscious Dravid let himself go as he would do at the end. Rarely has Kohli and Sharma celebrated the way they did, wrapping each other with an Indian flag and holding the trophy together. It isn’t just a reward for the last month in the US-Caribbean region but for the hard work and heartaches that have gone on in the last couple of years, at least. They came close to a whisker of doing this last November but were denied by Australia in the ODI World Cup. The stars had seemingly aligned then but combusted, leaving a lingering sign of whether they would ever overcome the final hurdle in an ICC tournament. The victory at the T20 World Cup has to be seen in the context of this achievement: Three men eager to hand over the baton to the next generation, but with their job accomplished and not wanting to pass on the burden of an unfulfilled past. Fittingly, Sharma showed the younger generation the aggressive template, taking it upon himself to do the hard yards as an opener while Kohli showed how to own big-game pressure. And, it was Dravid, who deflected attention from himself and ensured no panic calls were taken.","The T20 World Cup final in Barbados marked a poignant moment for Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, and Rahul Dravid. Kohli and Sharma, celebrating in style, achieved personal and professional milestones: Kohli redeemed himself from a disappointing T20 World Cup, Sharma cemented his legacy as a great leader, and Dravid sought redemption from a previous Caribbean defeat as his tenure as coach concluded. Their victory was not just a reward for the recent tournament but a culmination of years of effort and setbacks.

The 35-year-old took to social media to announce his decision, “With a heart full of gratitude, I bid farewell to T20 internationals,” he wrote.

Jadeja has played 74 T20Is in which he managed to score 515 runs at an average of 21.05 and strike rate of 127.16. With the ball, he scalped 54 wickets at an economy of 7.13.



The left-hander also mentioned that he would continue to be part of the team in other formats. “Like a steadfast horse galloping with pride, I’ve always given my best for my country and will continue to do so in other formats.”

“Winning the T20 World Cup was a dream come true, a pinnacle of my T20 International career. Thank you for the memories, the cheers, and the unwavering support,” Jadeja further wrote.

Though Jadeja has played all the games in the recently concluded World Cup he has had a forgettable campaign as a player. The batter managed to score just 35 runs in the entire tournament at an average of 11.67 and with the ball only picked one wicket.

Could not fit in team
Though Jadeja has been part of the Indian T20I setup for a long time his contributions with the bat have been few and far between. His limitations as a T20 batsman come from his deficiencies in his range hitting. He isn’t the power hitter that a team would slot in the lower order.

However, the Indian top order in T20Is has been populated with star names which meant that Jadeja had to bat in the lower order for the team as an all-rounder.

Even with the ball though he can tighten the screws in the middle overs he hardly has had match-winning spells. Captains also have been often reluctant to use him in the Powerplays. Jadeja has taken only 7 wickets in the first six overs and has an economy rate of 8.19.","Indian all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja has announced his retirement from T20 internationals. The 35-year-old took to social media to express his gratitude and mentioned that he would continue to be a part of the team in other formats. Jadeja played 74 T20Is, scoring 515 runs at an average of 21.05 and taking 54 wickets at an economy of 7.13. However, his contributions with the bat in T20Is have been limited, and his deficiencies in range hitting have been a challenge. Additionally, he hasn't had many match-winning spells with the ball and has been underutilized in the Powerplays. Despite these limitations, Jadeja played a crucial role in India's T20 World Cup victory and expressed his gratitude to the fans for their support.",Sports,120,336
The New Indian Express,2024-06-30 00:00:00,Ayushmann Khurrana opens up on dealing with back-to-back failures after Vicky Donor: ‘It becomes difficult…’,"Ayushmann Khurrana’s last movie Dream Girl 2 was one of the most successful films of his career. While the actor has maintained a good balance of hit films, he has also experienced back-to-back failures following his debut movie, Vicky Donor. In a recent interaction, the Article 15 actor reflected on this journey and recalled how his 2015 film Dum Laga Ke Haisha played a pivotal role, leading to a series of eight back-to-back superhits.

Speaking to Forbes India about how he dealt with failure, Ayushmann said, “I think you become a true man when you have the ability to deal with failures. Success is a very lousy teacher and your failures are your friends, a philosophers and guides. if you haven’t experienced failures during your early years, it becomes difficult to deal with them when you are at a certain age. Life is like that.”



He added, “After my first film, I saw 3 back-to-back unsuccessful films and its just the kind of films that I was getting. After Vicky Donor I had a certain benchmark but I wasn’t getting films of that ilk. That journey started again with Dum Laga Ke Haisha. Then there were 8 back-to-back super hit films after that. So, its not about the actor. It the kind of script writers you get in touch with and the choices you make, it isn’t about personal craft, it’s a collaborative effort.”

After making a successful debut in Shoojit Sircar’s Vicky Donor in 2012, Ayushmann Khurrana starred in Nautanki Saala, Bewakoofiyaan, and Hawaizaada. All three films bombed at the box office. He then starred in Sharat Katariya’s Dum Laga Ke Haisha, where he played the role of a disgruntled high-school dropout who gets married to an educated but overweight girl. Though he isn’t happy with this union initially, he gradually falls for her after they participate in a race. Made on a budget of Rs 14 crore, the film was box office success as it minted Rs 113 crore.","Ayushmann Khurrana, known for his successful films, recently spoke about his journey in the film industry and how he dealt with failures. After the success of his debut film ""Vicky Donor,"" he faced three consecutive failures. However, his film ""Dum Laga Ke Haisha"" turned things around for him, leading to a series of eight back-to-back superhits. Ayushmann believes that failures are valuable lessons and that they shape a person. He credits his success to the kind of scripts he chooses and the collaborative effort of the entire team. ""Dum Laga Ke Haisha,"" where he played the role of a man gradually falling in love with his overweight wife, was a box office success and played a pivotal role in his career. The film's budget was Rs 14 crore, and it went on to earn Rs 113 crore.

The New Indian Express,2024-06-30 00:00:00,INDIA bloc will protest in Parliament complex against ‘misuse’ of central agencies tomorrow: AAP’s Sanjay Singh,"AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh has announced that leaders of the INDIA bloc will protest in the Parliament complex at 10.30 am on Monday against the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s alleged misuse of the CBI and the ED to target Opposition leaders.

“The BJP-led Central Government and its prime investigating agencies are misusing power. Modi is targeting Opposition parties and filing fake cases. The CBI and the ED have filed false cases and investigations against every Opposition leader, from senior Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi to Mamata Banerjee to DMK leaders. They have arrested Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren. The ED and the CBI will go against whoever speaks against and does not join the BJP,” Singh said at a press conference on Sunday.

It was during a meeting held to discuss the issue that INDIA bloc leaders including Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge decided to demonstrate at the Parliament complex against BJP, according to Singh.

Singh further said, “The CBI and ED are also misleading the apex court…The court (Rouse Avenue Court) said in its order that the ED has no evidence against Arvind Kejriwal and that the agency is working with malicious intent. The ED has no money trail against Arvind Kejriwal, no evidence, no recovery of money. Hence Arvind Kejriwal is innocent. In the meantime, the ED reached the high court in an unconstitutional and illegal manner, without taking a copy of the order, and got a stay on his bail… Arvind Kejriwal was arrested by the CBI on the instructions of the Central Government and PM Modi.”

Asked about the AAP’s differences with the Congress in Delhi, Singh said, “I am giving information about the meeting where Khargeji also participated. This is a national level meeting… What can I say if a state president is going against their top leadership’s decision…they should answer this…”

He added, “If any state leader has an opinion against their senior national leaders like Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge, then they should give answers… If the Delhi unit is standing against the decisions of the INDIA bloc meeting, then their national leadership should respond…”

Delhi Congress president Devender Yadav has on several occasions alleged that the AAP does not care about the problems of the public and focuses on its “internal issues” like Kejriwal’s arrest. He has also called the AAP government “headless”.

The AAP and the Congress contested the Lok Sabha polls together in Delhi but failed to win any seat. The AAP has said that it will go it alone in the Assembly polls, saying “the agreement was only for the Lok Sabha polls”.

The leaders also said they would work together on national matters but separately in Delhi.","AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh has announced that the INDIA bloc will protest in the Parliament complex against the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's alleged misuse of the CBI and the ED to target opposition leaders.

The New Indian Express,2024-06-30 00:00:00,"A brief history of how the Korean War erupted in 1950, its impact on today’s geopolitics","The Korean War , which began on June 25, 1950, was a pivotal event in 20thcentury history, as it shaped the geopolitical landscape of East Asia and impacted
global affairs. It also resulted in a massive loss of life, with estimates suggesting
around 2.5 million people (including civilians and military personnel) perished.
Despite the cessation of active hostilities, the war has never formally ended – the
reason it is also called the “Forgotten War” sometimes. It concluded with an
armistice agreement on July 27, 1953, rather than a peace treaty, leaving North and
South Korea technically still at war.
This unresolved state of affairs continues to influence the region’s geopolitical
dynamics. Here’s what happened.
What led to the divide in the Korean peninsula?
The war was a result of Cold War tensions and the rivalry for supremacy
between the communist Soviet Union and the liberal capitalist United States. The
two superpowers emerged after the Second World War (1939 to 1945) and attempted to extend their influence over the Korean peninsula as it had just gained
independence from colonial rule.

Several dynasties ruled Korea before that with some uniting the entire region, such
as the Silla dynasty in the 7th century. Korea then came under Japanese colonial
rule from 1910 to 1945 and it ended with Japan’s surrender in WW2. However,
Korea’s liberation was quickly followed by division.
To manage the Japanese surrender, the Allied forces (comprising the US, the USSR,
the UK, France, and others) agreed to a temporary division of Korea into two
occupation zones: the Soviet Union-controlled one in the north and the US one in
the south.

US authorities decided the 38th parallel would be the dividing line. Future US
Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Colonel Charles “Tic” Bonesteel had to do the job.
Rusk later wrote in his memoir As I Saw It:
“During a meeting on August 14, 1945, the same day as the Japanese surrender,
[Bonesteel] and I retired to an adjacent room late at night and studied intently a
map of the Korean peninsula. Working in haste and under great pressure, we had a
formidable task: to pick a zone for the American occupation. Neither Tic nor I was a
Korea expert, but it seemed to us that Seoul, the capital, should be in the American
sector. We also knew that the U.S. Army opposed an extensive area of occupation.
Using a National Geographic map, we looked just north of Seoul for a convenient
dividing line but could not find a natural geographical line. We saw instead the
thirty-eighth parallel and decided to recommend that … [Our commanders]
accepted it without too much haggling, and surprisingly, so did the Soviets.”

Over time, the Cold War rivalry and the influence of the occupying powers made
the division permanent. Today, a buffer zone called the demilitarised zone (DMZ)
runs along the 38th parallel to avoid border skirmishes. Army members of both
countries guard it on either side.
In the North, the Soviet Union helped establish a communist regime led by Kim Ilsung, a former guerrilla fighter and Soviet-trained leader. In the South, the United
States supported the creation of a capitalist state under Syngman Rhee, an anticommunist leader who had spent many years in exile in the United States.
By 1948, two separate governments were officially established: the Democratic
People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea) and the Republic of Korea (South Korea),
each claiming legitimacy over the entire peninsula.

What led to the outbreak of the Korean War?
On June 25, 1950, North Korean forces, backed by the Soviet Union and China,
launched a surprise invasion of South Korea by crossing the 38th parallel. The
invasion began in the early morning and caught the South Korean army and its
American allies off guard.
The North Korean forces quickly advanced, overwhelming the South Korean
defences and capturing key areas — including the capital Seoul. This alarmed the international community and prompted the United Nations to intervene. The UN
Security Council passed a resolution condemning the invasion and calling for a
withdrawal of North Korean forces from South Korea.
","The Korean War began on June 25, 1950, and had a significant impact on global affairs. It resulted in the loss of around 2.5 million lives and has never formally ended. The war was a result of Cold War tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States, who sought to extend their influence over the Korean peninsula. After Korea gained independence from colonial rule, it was temporarily divided into two occupation zones, with the Soviet Union controlling the north and the US controlling the south. The division became permanent over time due to the Cold War rivalry and the influence of the occupying powers. The North established a communist regime under Kim Ilsung, and the South became a capitalist state under Syngman Rhee. On June 25, 1950, North Korean forces launched a surprise invasion of South Korea, prompting the United Nations to intervene.

Mr Shah chaired the BJP's state executive meeting to discuss poll strategy on Saturday in Panchkula. Addressing the BJP leaders and workers, Mr Shah said the BJP will go solo in the upcoming Haryana Assembly elections under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the leadership of chief minister Nayab Singh Saini. 


At the meeting, Mr Shah said that the BJP will have no tie-up for the state polls, which are due before October this year, as it does not need any crutches.

Besides preparing the outline for the Assembly elections, Mr Shah also infused fresh zeal and enthusiasm in the party workers. He also gave tips to the party workers and shared the roadmap and guidance for the impending polls.

Haryana’s BJP incharge and Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan lashed out at the Congress and said they are confused and lack an agenda for the people and that’s why during the two previous Assembly polls, people reposed their faith in the BJP.

""We believe that the BJP will form the government for the third consecutive time in Haryana after the Assembly election,"" he said.


Referring to the state executive meeting, Mr Pradhan said a political resolution has been passed and gratitude has been expressed to the people of Haryana for giving a third term to Mr Modi. He also said an appeal has been made to the people to once again give the BJP the mandate in Haryana.

Taking on his party's political rivals, mainly the Congress, Mr Pradhan said they do not have any political agenda. These are groups of people who ""spread lies"" and ""create doubts"".

After the meeting, the Haryana BJP posted on X that the Union home minister expressed gratitude to party workers and said the people of Haryana have made an important contribution in making Mr Modi Prime Minister for the third time.


Party's co-incharge Biplab Kumar Deb, Union minister Manohar Lal Khattar, Rajya Sabha member Subhash Barala, Lok Sabha MPs Naveen Jindal and Dharambir Singh, Haryana Assembly Speaker Gian Chand Gupta, former MP Kuldeep Bishnoi and MLA Kiran Chaudhary were among the attendees.

Senior BJP leaders O.P. Dhankar, Ram Bilas Sharma, ministers Mool Chand Sharma, J.P. Dalal, Kanwar Pal and Aseem Goel, MLAs, and former ministers, including Anil Vij and other leaders, were also present.

 Apart from state leaders and office-bearers, around 4,500 party workers from all 90-Assembly constituencies attended the meeting.

The BJP's Haryana incharge Dharmendra Pradhan criticized the Congress, alleging their lack of agenda and reliance on falsehoods. The party's resolution expressed gratitude for Modi's reelection and urged Haryana voters to grant BJP a third consecutive term.

The Hindu,2024-06-30 00:00:00,PM Surya Ghar fails to illuminate Telangana households due to portal glitches,"
Pradhan Mantri Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana, a scheme launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with much fanfare ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, is woefully lacking in implementation in Telangana due to web portal issues.

The objective of the scheme with an investment of ₹75,000 crore, was to enable a crore households across the country to install roof-top grid-connected solar energy systems by providing attractive subsidies. The amount of subsidy ranges between ₹30,000 and ₹78,000 for individual households based on the capacity. Group housing societies and residential welfare associations are eligible for a handsome subsidy of ₹18,000 per KW up to 500 KW.

Despite the attractive offer, the scheme has failed to take off in the State due to chronic, unresolved issues with the portal on the website of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. From the 15 districts covered by the Southern Power Distribution Company of Telangana alone, between February 13 and June 28 this year, a total 62,260 registrations were done on the national portal of the scheme. Of these, only 8,481 could register their application on the portal. A total 3,022 applicants paid fee for the feasibility assessment, and except 10, all applications have been issued feasibility certificate. Of these, only 1,451 applicants completed work, and 875 got the net metering completed. Notable is the fact that not a single applicant has got the subsidy so far under the scheme.

“I had applied in March this year, and got the net metering within a month and a half. But the subsidy has not been cleared so far. I have paid the EMI of three months on the loan availed. Initially they blamed it on election code, but even a month after the code is lifted, my subsidy has not arrived. I am holding off from recommending this scheme to my friends and relatives due to this,” complained Jayakumar from Karmanghat, who got a 3KW system installed on his rooftop.

J. Narasimha Rao, General Secretary of the Concrete Palazzo gated community’s owners welfare association, has a similar experience to narrate. He is unable to apply for subsidy for the past two months due to portal issues. “We installed a 105 KW unit for common power consumption spending ₹40 lakh, part of which is obtained through a loan. We are paying interest for the past five months. Whenever we try to apply, either the entry is unsuccessful or we end up not getting OTP. Residents have started questioning, and we are unable to answer them,” Mr. Narasimha Rao said.

There were no issues when the scheme was run through State government, he feels. However, the only mode of application for the PM Surya Ghar is through online. “This is pathetic implementation for a scheme which is announced by none other than the Prime Minister. It is all big talk, nothing on the ground,” says Mr. Narasimha Rao.

Vendors are the most disappointed lot, as shoddy implementation means loss of business for them. “Our losses aside, this scheme is a great opportunity and a milestone in the sector of renewable energy, but wasted due to portal issues. If implemented properly, it can inspire many more households and communities to go for the rooftop solar systems and reduce the burden of conventional power on the country,” said B. Ashok Kumar Goud, a vendor and president of the Telangana Solar Energy Association.

","The Pradhan Mantri Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana, aimed at promoting rooftop solar installations with substantial subsidies, faces severe implementation challenges in Telangana. Issues with the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy's web portal have hindered registrations, fee payments, and subsidy disbursements, affecting over 62,000 applicants. Despite initial enthusiasm, delays in subsidy approvals have left applicants frustrated, impacting both individuals and community projects. Critics highlight the scheme's promising goals marred by poor execution and technical glitches, limiting its potential impact on renewable energy adoption.",Politics,84,562

""Kenyan security forces shot directly into crowds of protesters on (Tuesday) June 25, 2024, including protesters who were fleeing,"" the NGO said in a statement.

""Although there is no confirmation on the exact number of people killed in Nairobi and other towns, Human Rights Watch found that at least 30 people had been killed on that day based on witness accounts, publicly available information, hospital and mortuary records in Nairobi as well as witness accounts,"" the statement said.

 Kenya police fire rubber bullets, tear gas at protesters after Ruto urges talks

""Shooting directly into crowds without justification, including as protesters try to flee, is completely unacceptable under Kenyan and international law,"" said Otsieno Namwaya, associate Africa director at Human Rights Watch.

""The Kenyan authorities need to make clear to their forces that they should be protecting peaceful protesters and that impunity for police violence can no longer be tolerated,"" Mr. Namwaya added.

The largely peaceful rallies turned violent on Tuesday when lawmakers passed the deeply unpopular tax increases following pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

After the announcement of the vote, crowds stormed the parliament complex and a fire broke out in clashes unprecedented in the history of the country since its independence from Britain in 1963.

President William Ruto's administration ultimately withdrew the bill.

IMF pressure
The state-funded Kenya National Commission on Human Rights said it had recorded 22 deaths and 300 injured victims, adding it would open an investigation.

""Eight military officers came out and just opened fire on people. They killed several people, including those who were not part of the protests,"" HRW quoted a rights activist in Nairobi as saying.

""Kenya's international partners should continue to actively monitor the situation... and further urge Kenyan authorities to speedily but credibly and transparently investigate abuses by the security forces,"" the rights watchdog said.

Mr. Ruto had already rolled back some tax measures after the protests began, prompting the treasury to warn of a gaping budget shortfall of 200 billion shillings ($1.6 billion).

The cash-strapped government had said previously that the increases were necessary to service Kenya's massive debt of some 10 trillion shillings ($78 billion), equal to roughly 70% of GDP.

The Washington-based IMF has urged the country to implement fiscal reforms in order to access crucial funding from the international lender.

""The bill was expected to raise an additional $2.3 billion in the next fiscal year, in part to meet IMF requirements to increase revenues,"" HRW said.

""Widespread outrage should be a wake-up call to the Kenyan government and the IMF that they cannot sacrifice rights in the name of economic recovery,"" Mr. Namwaya said.

""Economic sustainability can only be achieved by building a new social contract that raises revenues fairly, manages them responsibly, and funds services and programs that protect everyone's rights.""","Protests in Kenya over proposed tax increases turned deadly with at least 30 people killed amid clashes and police actions, according to Human Rights Watch.

She said a team from the National Commission for Women (NCW) will arrive at Cooch Behar later in the day to assess the situation.

“There is no respect or safety for women in West Bengal, despite Mamata Banerjee being a woman Chief Minister,” Ms. Paul claimed on Saturday, while staging a protest in front of the office of the Superintendent of Police in Cooch Behar against the alleged incident. “When the same incident took place in Manipur, she sent a team to look into the matter and criticised the Central government. But when it happens in West Bengal, no team is sent by the Chief Minister.”

The Asansol South MLA also claimed that under the Trinamool Congress government, it is a “sin” to support the Opposition parties. “When our sister, who hails from the same minority community as the Chief Minister’s vote-bank, supports BJP, Trinamool workers threaten and jeopardise her safety,” Ms. Paul remarked. She alleged that the woman was stripped naked, beaten and paraded on the streets by ruling party workers.

Seven-member panel
Earlier, West Bengal BJP president Sukanata Majumdar constituted a seven-member team led by Ms. Paul to inquire into the incident. Besides, Mr. Majumdar also called the victim over phone on Saturday, asking her about her condition and assuring her that if needed, she would be brought to Kolkata for treatment. Currently, she is being treated at MJN Medical College in Cooch Behar.

At the protest site in Cooch Behar, Ms. Paul said the police have falsely claimed that the alleged victim’s clothes had accidentally slipped off amid pushing and shoving. “We do not trust the police. They are claiming the incident was a case of family dispute,” she asked.

On Friday, police officials said a case had been registered on the alleged incident and three accused have also been arrested in that regard.

The New Indian Express,2024-06-30 00:00:00,Anant Ambani-Radhika Merchant’s wedding invite includes this unique pashmina shawl,"Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant’s wedding invitation has captured attention
not just for its lavish and thoughtful design, but also for a particularly exquisite gift
accompanying it — a dorukha pashmina shawl, handcrafted by artisans in
Kashmir.

This thoughtful inclusion goes beyond luxury, representing cultural heritage, artisanal craftsmanship, and socio-economic significance. Ghulam Muhammed Beigh of the Beigh Family, Gazi Doori Alamgari Bazar, Srinagar, Kashmir, shared with indianexpress.com what makes a dorukha pashmina shawl so special, the intricate process behind its creation, and why its presence in this high-profile wedding invitation speaks volumes about tradition, artistry, and the preservation of India’s textile legacy.

In a grand gesture befitting their status, the Ambani family has chosen to gift their wedding guests with dorukha pashmina shawls, showcasing not only the family’s opulence but also a centuries-old tradition of Kashmiri craftsmanship.

What makes the dorukha pashmina shawl unique?
The dorukha pashmina shawl stands out as a pinnacle of luxury and artistry in the world of textiles. Beigh explained, “Dorukha shawls are known for their delicate embroidery, with up to 500 stitches per square centimeter. The intricacy of each stitch is such that the design appears identical on both sides.”

This level of craftsmanship requires not just skill, but an extraordinary amount of patience and time. Beigh said, “For a masterpiece dorukha jamawar shawl, it takes more than 2.5 years.” This lengthy handcrafting process contributes to the shawl’s exclusivity and value. The cost of such shawls depends on the category of work that is done, light weave can cost Rs 10-12,000, while heavy weaving is slightly more expensive.

How pashmina shawls, particularly the dorukha type, are handcrafted by artisans in Kashmir
Historically, the dorukha technique was even more intricate. “In the past, dorukha shawls were also made using the kani technique, which has practically vanished today. This lost art involved a unique interlocking weave; the threads were trimmed at the back, and only the outlines of the pattern details were embroidered,” Beigh said.

The choice of material is crucial in creating these exquisite shawls. While modern versions may use silk or cotton threads for embroidery, the most prized dorukha shawls are made entirely from pashmina. “In the past, most dorukha shawls were crafted entirely from pashmina. This included both the base fabric and the embroidery thread. This use of pashmina throughout the shawl made dorukha truly unique compared to other shawls,” explained Beigh.

How pashmina wool used in these shawls is different from other types
Pashmina, derived from the undercoat of Changthangi goats, native to the high altitudes of Ladakh, is renowned for its softness and warmth. Beigh emphasised the superiority of pashmina over regular wool. “Dorukha shawls can also be made from wool, but wool isn’t as popular as pashmina because it’s less soft.” This softness, combined with the durability needed for intricate embroidery, makes pashmina the ideal material for dorukha shawls.

The creation of a dorukha pashmina shawl showcases human skill and dedication. The craftsman must be “fully experienced; he should know where, when, and how many stitches it would take to make a flower or pattern in front of him,” Beigh said.

The dorukha pashmina shawl stands as a reminder of the value of handcrafted artistry. These shawls represent centuries of Kashmiri craftsmanship, serving as a bridge between tradition and modernity.","Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant's wedding invitation has caught attention for its luxurious design and the inclusion of a dorukha pashmina shawl, handcrafted by artisans in Kashmir. The dorukha pashmina shawl is known for its delicate embroidery and intricate stitching, with up to 500 stitches per square centimeter. The design is identical on both sides, making it unique and exclusive. The shawls can take more than 2.5 years to create and the cost varies depending on the level of craftsmanship. Historically, dorukha shawls were made using the kani technique, which is now almost extinct. Pashmina wool, derived from Changthangi goats in Ladakh, is preferred for its softness and durability. The creation of a dorukha pashmina shawl requires skilled craftsmanship and serves as a reminder of centuries-old Kashmiri artistry.",Lifestyle and Features,128,549
The New Indian Express,2024-06-30 00:00:00,Understanding tragedy with love,"Children, disaster unexpectedly strikes the lives of many of us. The sudden death of a loved one or unbearable financial losses can make us lose our mental balance. We may then feel overwhelmed by sorrow and disappointment.

If anyone is responsible for this pain, we might feel intense anger towards that person. That anger can lead to a strong desire to take revenge. However, if we are careful not to act indiscriminately, we can lead the mind back to the right path.

To do so, we must calm the mind at once. Only a calm mind can think clearly. Strong and uncontrolled emotions affect one’s discernment and impair one’s memory. Hence, instead of reacting impulsively, we must calm the mind down first so that we can think clearly and ascertain the causes for the disaster that befell us.

Amma remembers a story. A drunken driver knocked into a young man, killing him. The young man’s mother could not bear the sorrow of her son’s untimely death. For days on end, she remained lost in memories of her beloved son. She was overwhelmed by grief, which slowly transformed into the desire for revenge. She decided to kill the driver to avenge her son’s death.

But when her mind became calmer, another thought entered her mind: “If I kill him, will my son come back to life? No. Not only that, I suffered unbearable anguish because of my son’s death. If I kill that man, his mother and loved ones will suffer so much. Why must they grieve because of me? No one else should suffer the misfortune I did.”","Disasters, such as the sudden death of a loved one or severe financial losses, can overwhelm us with sorrow and disappointment.

Islamic State fighters have killed nearly 4,100 people in Syria since 2019 when the jihadists lost their last stronghold in the country, a war monitor said on June 29.

IS overran large swathes of Syria and Iraq in 2014, proclaiming a so-called caliphate and launching a reign of terror in June of that year.

In March 2019, the jihadist group lost its last scraps of Syrian territory in a Kurdish-led military campaign backed by a US-led coalition, but remnants continue to launch deadly attacks from desert hideouts.

 Decade after IS horrors, Iraq's Sinjar remains in ruins

IS fighters ""have killed about 4,100 people in more than 2,550 operations in areas controlled by the regime or"" the semi-autonomous Kurdish administration since 2019, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said in a report.

Most of the victims are soldiers, government loyalists and Kurdish-led fighters, but the toll also incudes 627 civilians, the Britain-based Observatory said.

More than half of the 4,085 victims fell in Syria's vast Badia desert, which runs from the outskirts of Damascus to the Iraqi border.

 Watch | What is the Islamic State-Khorasan and why did they attack Russia?

A total of ""2,744 people have been killed by the IS group since its formal collapse in 2019, in various areas of the Syrian desert,"" said the monitor, which relies on a network of sources inside the country.

IS fighters have killed more than 2,500 government loyalists and soldiers in the Badia since their so-called caliphate fell, according to the Observatory.

""Hardly a day goes by without bombings, ambushes, targeted operations or surprise attacks"" by the jihadists in the region, the report said.

 Attack blamed on IS militants kills 22 pro-government fighters in central Syria

""These operations are met with periodic security campaigns carried out by regime forces and groups loyal to them deep in the desert, with... Russian warplanes targeting the desert on a near-daily basis,"" it added.

The group has sustained heavy damage, losing more than 2,000 fighters including top leaders since 2019, the report found.

A United Nations report released in January said IS's combined strength in Iraq and Syria was between 3,000 and 5,000 fighters, with the Badia serving as a logistics and operations hub for the group in Syria.

Syria's war has killed more than half a million people and displaced millions more since it broke out in March 2011 with Damascus's brutal repression of anti-government protests.

","Since losing its last stronghold in Syria in March 2019, Islamic State (IS) fighters have killed nearly 4,100 people in the country through over 2,550 operations, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Asian Age,2024-06-30 00:00:00,India Come Back from the Dead to Emerge Champions,"Bridgetown (Barbados): Team India came back from the dead to stun South Africa by seven runs and emerge champions of the T20 World Cup at the Kensington Oval here on a Super Saturday.

Brilliant bowling at the death from pacers Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh and a breathtaking catch on the boundary by Suryakumar Yadav in the last over turned the game around for the champions after they were down and almost out after 15 overs — South Africa needed 30 at run-a-ball with six wickets in hand and looked set to hunt down India’s 176 for 7.


Bumrah conceded four runs in the 16th over and just two in the 18th which also fetched the wicket of Marco Jansen while Arshdeep gave away four in the penultimate over to tighten the screws. Then, with South Africa needing 16 runs off the last over bowled by Hardik Pandya, SKY turned a certain six into a controlled catch to get rid of the dangerous David Miller (21) and put the opposition on the mat. They could not get up and eventually limped to 169 for 8.

Heinrich Klaasen had taken the game away with his 27-ball 52 before India pulled it back. Quinton de Kock (39) and Tristan Stubbs (31) were the other run-getters for South Africa, who will continue to carry the ‘Chokers’ tag that has been around their necks for a long time.


Earlier, India posted the highest total in a T20 World Cup final thanks to a steady 76 by opener Virat Kohli, a valuable 47 from Axar Patel and their innings-stabilising 72-run partnership for the fourth wicket after the team had slipped to 34 for 3 in the fifth over.

They began well though. Kohli drove on either side of the wicket to pick three boundaries in the first over bowled by left-arm pacer Jansen as the Blues took 15 off the opening over.

From the other end, Rohit cut and reverse swept Keshav Maharaj for successive boundaries but was out, caught brilliantly by Klaasen at square leg as he tried to sweep the left-arm spinner. India 23 for 1. Two balls later, Rishabh Pant fell for a duck, top edging Keshav Maharaj to de Kock behind the stumps. Another brilliant catch by Klaasen, running to his left at fine leg, saw the departure of Suryakumar Yadav (3) and put India in trouble.
At the end of Powerplay, India were 45 for 3, their slowest since the Super Eight stage in the tournament.

India’s 50 came up in the eighth over, in 43 balls and included seven fours. Soon, Axar Patel lifted Markram into the stands for the first six of the game. Next over, he carted Maharaj out of the ground.

Axar also brought up India’s 100, with a six over long-on off pacer Kagiso Rabada on the first ball of an eventful 14th over, in which he got run out courtesy a direct hit at the non-striker’s end by wicket-keeper de Kock. Axar’s 31-ball innings was decorated with four sixes and a boundary.

Next man Shivam Dube did not let the wicket affect him, launching Jansen into the stands. He then stung Shamsi to the midwicket boundary. The left-hander contributed a quick 27 to the total and was involved in a 57-run stand for the fifth wicket with Kohli.Kohli got to his half-century in 48 balls with just four boundaries. Soon, he upped the tempo, hitting Rabada for a six and a four in the 18th over. The former captain was out in the penultimate over while trying to hit Jansen out of the ground, only for Rabada to pull off the catch on the boundary.

Dube followed his long-standing partner with two balls left in the innings, caught by David Miller off pacer Anrich Nortje, who was the best South African bowler on show with 2 for 26 from his four overs. It was not enough.

 ","In a thrilling finale at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, Team India clinched the T20 World Cup title by defeating South Africa by seven runs in a nail-biting encounter.

Batting first, India recovered from a shaky start of 34 for 3 thanks to a resilient 76 from opener Virat Kohli and a crucial 47 from Axar Patel. Their partnership of 72 runs steadied the innings after early setbacks, setting a challenging target of 176 for 7. Kohli's innings was marked by steady accumulation rather than explosive hitting, supported by crucial contributions from Axar Patel and Shivam Dube towards the end.

In reply, South Africa seemed in control with 30 needed off the last five overs and six wickets in hand. However, Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh's exceptional bowling in the death overs turned the tide. Bumrah's miserly spells and crucial wickets, coupled with Arshdeep's tight penultimate over, shifted momentum towards India. The highlight was Suryakumar Yadav's stunning catch on the boundary off Hardik Pandya's bowling, which dismissed David Miller and effectively sealed the match in India's favor.

Despite Heinrich Klaasen's aggressive fifty, South Africa faltered in the final overs, ending at 169 for 8, falling short of India's total. This victory marks India's resilience and tactical brilliance in a high-pressure final, securing their status as champions of the T20 World Cup.",Sports,221,652

He said the family received his father’s body around 12.30 p.m. on Saturday after a post-mortem.

“Our family is saddened by the death and we are discussing whether we should file a case against those who have been involved in this kind of criminal negligence. It could have led to the death of many more people,” Mr. Ravinder said.

The Hindu,2024-06-30 00:00:00,What was the tussle over Covaxin IPR?,"The story so far: The maker of the indigenous coronavirus vaccine, Covaxin, Bharat Biotech International Limited (BBIL), has admitted to an “inadvertent error” in patent filings to protect the vaccine’s Intellectual Property Rights (IPR). One of India’s leading biotechnology companies, it had failed to include scientists from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) as co-inventors in the Covaxin patent filings.

 Patent filings credit Bharat Biotech as ‘inventor’ of Covaxin, omit ICMR

What kind of rights govern vaccine patents?
India’s patent laws govern both product and process patents. Product patents grant an inventor a monopoly over, say, a drug. Process patents bar competitors from making a similar drug using the same sequence of steps. In response to queries from The Hindu, Bharat Biotech said it had patented the process, namely of making a batch of vaccines from the virus strains that were provided by the ICMR-NIV (National Institute of Virology). This is the lab that has expertise in extracting viruses from blood samples, identifying its characteristics, conducting various tests to gauge its infectiousness and qualify it in comparison to related strains. However, preparing a vaccine out of this at an industrial scale is beyond the capabilities of a lab and requires a different order of facilities that only established vaccine manufacturers have. Covaxin is an inactivated version of COVID-causing coronavirus; once injected into the body it coaxes it into producing antibodies that can potentially protect against severe disease from a coronavirus infection. To do this effectively, an ‘adjuvant’ is added which increases the vaccine’s potency. Vaccine makers may have their own ways of bringing all of these steps together and, given the competitive nature of the field, strive to ward off competitors from imitating these processes to gain a temporary monopoly in the market and rake profits.

To be sure, while companies are free to file for a product or process patent in as many countries as they can afford, a patent is only granted after regulatory authorities grant them one or are convinced that this process is indeed novel or inventive. BBIL, as far is publicly known, hasn’t yet been granted these patents.

 Erred in not crediting ICMR as co-inventor of Covaxin, says Bharat Biotech

What were the roles of BBIL and ICMR?
BBIL had collaborated with the ICMR-NIV for all the steps in developing a vaccine. The two organisations had signed an agreement that spelt out each entity’s responsibilities. As ICMR is a public entity and because of the scale of the COVID crisis, there were Right To Information requests to make this agreement public. However, it was only in July 2021, that parts of the agreement were made public in Rajya Sabha.

Beyond transferring the strains and making vaccines, the agreement said, ICMR would also test these vaccines on animals — rodents to monkeys — and then on people to establish that the vaccine worked as intended. The ICMR also funded these clinical trials — ₹35 crore — and incurred costs in developing Covaxin. In return it was to get 5% of royalties that BBIL earned from the sale of Covaxin. Since the announcement of the BBIL and ICMR collaboration, it was generally accepted that both entities would contribute to the vaccine and would therefore hold “joint intellectual property rights,” as was stated in Parliament.

However, BBIL first told The Hindu that it made a distinction between the rights governing the making of the vaccine and the rights over the data generated from clinical trials. The ICMR hadn’t invested in the actual making of the vaccine and so wasn’t included in patent applications. However, a day after the matter became public, BBIL said it had made a mistake, and that it would be making amends by filing fresh applications that listed ICMR personnel as inventors. It is unclear what prompted this.

 Adolescent girls at risk after receiving Covaxin, says study

Why does being cited as an inventor matter?
IPR is a vast, complex domain and spans the minutest parts of the product invention process. As the development of pharmaceutical products involves a wide range of expertise, it is hard for single firms or entities to develop everything in-house. Just like the BBIL-ICMR collaboration, companies may enter into several licensing agreements — BBIL for instance had a technology licensing agreement with Virovax for the adjuvant — with other companies. If a single product thus involves multiple entities and collaborators, being listed as an inventor has a bearing on the sharing of intellectual property rights, royalties and even determining how a product can be used. There is no field of human activity that is untouched by disputes over IPR. In patent filings, not listing out all the inventors — in the U.S especially — could even lead to patent applications being rejected.

","Bharat Biotech admitted to an error in patent filings for Covaxin, failing to credit scientists from ICMR as co-inventors. The vaccine development involved a collaboration where ICMR contributed strains and funding for clinical trials. Listing inventors accurately in patent filings is crucial for determining intellectual property rights, royalties, and legal protections in the competitive pharmaceutical industry.",Health and Wellness,56,793
The Hindu,2024-06-30 00:00:00,Humour for the soul,"Man creates humour. Maybe it is a naturally evolved mechanism to relieve stress and balance the stability of mind. The physical effect of humour, in turn, relaxes the body as well. Francis Bacon said, “Imagination was given to man to compensate him for what he is not, and sense of humour to console him for what he is.”

The report of a study in the U.S., published in the Journal of Aging Research in June 2010, says jokes and funny stories have a therapeutic effect on patients. It exhorted nurses and healthcare professionals to use humour therapy as a means of reducing loneliness as well as increasing happiness and life satisfaction in the elderly.

Communicating humour is a skill. A person with a nose for wit creates jokes and communicates them effectively through words, actions or both for others to enjoy. The creator enjoys both the humour and the appreciation of the listeners. That way it is a bonanza for him. A joke needs to be presented in an apt manner, with minimum appropriate words without losing the punch by elaborating. The timing of the shot is also very important. Untimely joke may cause embarrassment. So it is not everybody’s cup of tea. An excellent joke becomes a dull story in the hands of an unskilled guy. There is a saying that a joke is no more a joke when it hurts somebody. Often jokes cracked in friendly groups are sarcastic in style which should be limited to levels not to offend anybody.

All of us can enjoy jokes. Listening to funny stories by habitual jokers, reading humorous writings and watching comedy programmes are all sources of getting a daily quota of humour to laugh away the inevitable stresses and tensions. Charlie Chaplin, the man who made the whole world laugh, said “a day without laughter is a day wasted”.

Even those who are unskilled in expressing jokes can generate and enjoy humour for themselves. Passively watching the actions of other people around in a public place, one may find many a funny scene to enjoy. I have often felt that homeless people relaxing in their evenings beside footpaths enjoy the fun in watching busy bees moving in endless hurry.

Sometimes humour is produced unawares. Here is an example. A security officer in a company was caught red-handed by other staff when he was taking home some used packing materials for personal use. He asked, “Everyone takes these things unhampered, then why do you stop me alone?” He forgot for a moment that he was the person responsible to avert any pilferage.

With a dose of joke, anger may turn into smile and quarrel can end up in laughter. There is a popular jingle of an adhesive which says “joins everything except broken hearts”. Humour joins even broken hearts.","Humour is a natural mechanism evolved to relieve stress and balance the mind's stability, as noted by Francis Bacon. Studies show that jokes and funny stories have therapeutic effects, particularly in reducing loneliness and increasing happiness among elderly patients. Communicating humour is a skill that requires timing and appropriateness to avoid causing offense. Humour, whether through jokes, stories, or observational comedy, serves as a valuable tool for alleviating stress and tensions in daily life.",Health and Wellness,74,469

The Hindu,2024-06-30 00:00:00,"Assam school policy: Be good parents, gain marks for your wards","Self-employed Nabajyoti Barua has been trying to eliminate swear words from his vocabulary lest his four-year-old son picks them up. He has also cut down on his ‘adda’ (chatting sessions with friends) to devote more time to his son’s studies at home in Sivasagar district’s Jhanji Baruagaon village.

Home-maker Purabi Dutta of Kaliapani village in the adjoining Jorhat district has been focussing on managing her anger and exuding positivity to keep her daughter, a little more than three years old, cheerful at home.

Their effort is to ensure that their wards studying at the Jyoti Protap Gyanmarg Bidyalay earn 20 non-academic marks in each subject to score at least 60% in the annual exams to be promoted to a higher class.

The school covering more than two acres is on National Highway 127 at Kaliapani, a village about 330 kms east of Guwahati and on the eastern edge of the Jorhat district.

Mr. Barua and Ms. Dutta know that their wards – admitted to the nursery class in April – have to meet the school’s condition of scoring at least 60% marks to be retained when they get promoted to class one. “Habits take time to change. So, we have started now to be ready when the time comes,” Ms. Dutta said.

Biju Kumar Sarmah, the coordinator of the school, defended the condition set by the Jyoti Protap Education Trust for spending ₹30-lakh annually on free education, books, uniforms, meals, vocational training, and life skills apart from providing access to digital learning, robotics, and most other facilities offered by high-end urban schools at a premium.

The trust is named after local businessman Protap Saikia and his deceased wife Jyoti Saikia. It is funded by a large chunk of the earnings from Mr. Saikia’s businesses and investments in insurance policies.

“We understand each student is different and they could be under pressure to attain the minimum marks but we prepare them in an environment of fun to be able to confidently absorb it without realising it. The condition is more for parents to imbibe human values in their children and ensure they play, study, and be self-sufficient,” he told The Hindu.

Only five of the State Board-affiliated school’s 210 students were found to be lagging but they were eventually promoted after extra classes and some grace marks.

Super 30 model
“Rural children are generally more resilient than their urban counterparts but they lack access to opportunities and confidence to face a highly competitive world beyond their comfort zone. Unfortunately, we are in a rat race, and we want our children to withstand the challenges later in life by setting a goal now – 60% in their case,” Mr. Saikia, the trust’s secretary, said.

He insisted that the goal is attainable without much sweat as 10% is based on extracurricular activities and discipline of a child and 10% on good parenting. “Ultimately, the parents are responsible for this 20% added to each subject of 100 marks with the students required to answer questions for 80 marks,” he said.

Mr. Saikia and his associates studied the best educational practices around the globe before establishing Jyoti Protap Gyanmarg Bidyalay in 2021. If schools in Japan gave the idea of letting children keep their classes clean, tend to potted plants – each child has one in his or her name in the school – and learn skills such as producing vermicompost, the Super 30 model decided the maximum number of students to be admitted per class.

“Although the norm is 40 students per teacher, we have capped the number of students at 30 per class. Our standard would be followed when we gradually upgrade to class 12 from class five now,” Mr. Saikia said.

“The school caters to children from various backgrounds living within a radius of 30 kms. I want them to excel academically because I could not as circumstances forced me to earn a living at 11 years,” he said.

The Super 30 model is envisaged to extend to students who can return as successful adults to continue running the school charitably for “children of the future after I am gone”, Mr. Saikia said.

Wait and earn
The school has a fairly comfortable waiting zone for parents who come from afar to drop off their children and wait to take them back home after classes. The zone is equipped with a monitor where they can see how their children are taught and what they do in class.

“We have noticed most parents spend four to five hours sitting, chatting, or pacing around. We have decided to equip the waiting zone with a loom, tools for various kinds of work, and a mini food processing unit so they can be productive according to their abilities,” Mr. Saikia said.

“But producing cloth, pickles, jellies, or any handicraft item is meaningless without market linkage. We are also lining up buyers so the parents can earn as they wait,” he said.

","Nabajyoti Barua and Purabi Dutta, parents from Assam, are making concerted efforts to improve their behaviors and focus on their children's education at Jyoti Protap Gyanmarg Bidyalay. The school, supported by the Jyoti Protap Education Trust, emphasizes holistic development and parental involvement to ensure students achieve at least 60% in their exams. The trust, funded by local businessman Protap Saikia, aims to provide quality education and vocational training to rural children, following models like Japan's clean classroom practices and India's Super 30 for effective learning outcomes.",Education,86,824
The Hindu,2024-06-30 00:00:00,"Days after restricting bar association, J&K High Court recognises new lawyers’ body in Kashmir","The J&K and Ladakh High Court on Saturday recognised a new lawyers’ body in Kashmir, the Kashmir Advocates Association (KAA), by exercising powers under Section 58 of the Bar Council, which was extended to J&K after the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019.

The move came days after the District Magistrate, Srinagar, barred the J&K High Court Bar Association (JKHCBA), a lawyers’ body active for several decades, from holding any elections, citing their “anti-national and pro-secessionist” ideology. The order also highlighted the JKHCBA’s history of “providing free legal aid to anti-nationals”.

A spokesman of the KAA, while announcing official recognition, said the High Court exercised powers of the Bar Council under Section 58 of the Advocates Act 1961.

“This recognition marks a historic milestone, as the KAA becomes the first and only Advocates Association/Bar Association to receive such acknowledgement from the Bar Council of J&K and the Hon’ble High Court of J&K&L,” the KAA said.

The Bar Council was introduced to J&K after its special status was abrogated in 2019 to bring the J&K&L courts at par with the rest of the country. However, the Bar Council, which is otherwise an elected body, has not seen elections yet and the J&K&L assumes its de facto charge in absence of an elected body.

The KAA said the recognition was a testament to the dedication, hard work, and unwavering commitment of the members in upholding the principles of justice and advocating for the legal community in the region. 

“The KAA is committed to work for the welfare of legal professionals practising in different courts of the Union Territory. By addressing the needs and concerns of its members, the association aims to enhance the professional environment and ensure their well-being,” the KAA said.

It expressed “sincere gratitude to the Hon’ble Chief Justice of the High Court of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh, his companion judges, the Hon’ble High Court of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh, the Bar Council of Jammu & Kashmir, and all the members of the legal fraternity who have supported and encouraged the association throughout this journey”.

“The association looks forward to further strengthening its efforts in working for the betterment and welfare of advocates in Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh, particularly in the Kashmir Valley,” the KAA said.

Meanwhile, the former president of the JKHBA, Mian Qayoom, was arrested recently in a case related to the assassination of lawyer Babar Qadri in 2020 at his residence in Srinagar’s Hawal area.","The J&K and Ladakh High Court has recognized a new lawyers' body, the Kashmir Advocates Association (KAA), using powers under Section 58 of the Advocates Act 1961, which was applied to J&K after the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019. This recognition follows the District Magistrate of Srinagar's ban on the J&K High Court Bar Association (JKHCBA) from holding elections due to alleged anti-national activities.

The Hindu,2024-06-30 00:00:00,Björn Höcke | The rabble-rouser,"While addressing a gathering late last year, far-right German politician Björn Höcke, then on trial for raising a Nazi slogan at a 2021 rally, invoked the phrase “Everything for…,” prompting the crowd to respond “Germany” to complete the banned Nazi slogan, which was inscribed on the knives of Adolf Hitler’s storm troopers, who played a key role in his rise to power in the 1930s.

The former history teacher had earlier faced criticism for inciting racial hatred and using anti-Semitic language when he described the Holocaust memorial in Berlin as a “monument of shame” and called for a“180-degree turn” in how Germany remembers its past.

“Never, never must we allow ourselves to let the demagogy of a Björn Höcke go unchallenged,” the then Germany’s Vice Chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel, said. The Central Council of Jews said the “anti-Semitic and utterly inhuman words” had revealed the true face of the Alternative for Germany (AfD). The party nearly expelled him, warning that his approach could “damage its acceptance.”

Despite a string of controversies, the 52-year-old rose through the ranks of the AfD far-right party to become one of the most powerful figures in the shifting German political landscape. He has consistently pushed the limits of public discourse with controversial stances on history, nationalism, race and migrants.

He now stands trial for the second time on charges of using a Nazi slogan, just months ahead of the regional elections in Thuringia, where he plans to run for Governor.

History deeply influenced Mr. Höcke’s life and career. He was born in Lünen, Westphalia, in 1972, with roots tracing to German refugees from East Prussia. His upbringing instilled a sense of displacement and a longing for a lost homeland, themes evident in his political ideology. “Key to understanding Höcke is his ideology-shaping heritage of East Prussia where Höcke’s forebears originated... A second ideology-shaping element is the idea that ‘battles create identities’... Höcke says, ‘to be Prussian is a lifestyle’… This means Prussian authoritarian militarism,” Sebastian Hennig notes in the book Never Twice in the Same River. He described Mr. Höcke’s life as “dutiful” until he became aware of “German suffering” and felt the need to change the national discourse. In 2013, he co-founded the AfD’s Thuringia chapter, launching his political career.

Revisionist views
Quickly rising to prominence as one of Thuringia’s most radical figures, Mr. Höcke gained notoriety for his revisionist views on Nazi history and rhetoric reminiscent of the 1930s. During the 2015 European migrant crisis, he warned large crowds against “German alienation”. His oratory style drew comparisons to Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels.

Mr. Höcke participated in far-right demonstrations, made racist comments, attempted to normalise Nazi-era words, and questioned national guilt over the Holocaust. “Germans are the only people in the world who plant a monument of shame in the heart of their capital... the laughable policy of coming to terms with the past is crippling us,” he said. He claimed multiculturalism threatened Germany’s existence and used anti-Islamic rhetoric to advocate for the concentration of power with a single individual.

Mr. Höcke’s divisive remarks caused internal strife, leading to expulsion proceedings that were ultimately overturned. In 2019, a court ruled that it is legally justifiable to label him a “fascist”. The AfD’s regional branch was placed under surveillance as a “right-wing extremist” group.

Mr. Höcke attributed his “rhetorical missteps” to a media witch hunt. On one occasion, he stormed out of an interview after being shown clips where his AfD colleagues couldn’t distinguish between his remarks and those from Mein Kampf.

His relentless testing of political boundaries peaked when he concluded a speech at a political event with the Nazi slogan “Everything for Germany” in 2021. In court he argued he was unaware of its “criminal relevance.” However, he repeated the slogan at another event in December 2023 while still on trial. The legal troubles didn’t affect his popularity, though.

Following the AfD’s strong show in the EU Parliament elections, Mr. Höcke is now focused on Thuringia, aiming for victory in the regional polls. If successful, Björn Höcke could secure his first constitutional post, transitioning from a polarising figure to a potential state Premier.","Björn Höcke, a prominent figure in Germany's far-right AfD party, faces ongoing controversy and legal challenges for invoking Nazi slogans and espousing revisionist views on history and nationalism. Despite internal party conflicts and legal scrutiny, he continues to rise in political influence, aiming to become Governor of Thuringia in upcoming elections, reflecting a divisive shift in German politics.",Human Interest,58,690
The telegraph,2024-06-30 00:00:00,"Out, proud and loud: Members of Kolkata’s LGBTQIA+ community on what Pride Month means to them","Pride Month stands for a community’s fight for basic rights. Celebrated all throughout the month of June around the world, Pride Month also raises awareness about the rights of the LGBTQIA+ community, shedding light on the stereotypes and stigmas that the community faces.

As June draws to a close, My Kolkata reached out to members of the queer community for their thoughts on Pride Month and the challenges they continue to face. Excerpts…
‘Queer people remain queer all through the year’
Bishan Samaddar, editor at Seagull Books, is proud of his identity. Bishan helms the Pride Literature section of Seagull Books, which gives him the chance to meet people with diverse stories and backgrounds. “To me, Pride Month is important because it marks the progress that has been made in securing LGBTQ+ rights and visibility across the board in our society. It is, at the same time, a reminder of how much more needs to be done to achieve a semblance of equality,” believes Bishan.

Societal evolution and acceptance of members of the LGBTQIA+ community into the mainstream during the Pride Month is something that he takes note of. “But, I must say that this must extend to every month of the year — not the celebrations or the parties, but the recognition, the acceptance, the equal treatment. Because we queer people remain queer all through the year,” he said.Bishan is breaking stereotypes in his own way. “Most queer people are just as 'normal' as straight people. More focus should be on queer people leading their lives successfully in conventional jobs or careers. This will send out the message that queer people are like everyone else in most ways and they are every walk of life, contributing to society,” he says.

‘My sexuality or gender is not my whole identity’
“There's a list of stereotypes I can give you that are associated with the queer community,” said Dr. Abubakar Parvez. The doctor shared how queers are often thought to be indecent, available and desperate for sex.

Awwboo, as he is affectionately called, believes “This age-old idea of queers being ‘desperate’ and ‘available’ subjects us to a different kind of discrimination and injustice. Our personal space is not respected because apparently, we don't need one. But how do I explain that it's a fundamental right and we do respect it as much as we want it to be respected?” Awwboo asks.

To him, his identity is much more than the labels and attributions. “Coming to the point of indecency, year after year, queers have been oppressed for their expression of identity, sexuality and gender. It definitely comes off as a defence mechanism where people are as loud as they can be, to prove and show that they exist,” he said.

Out, proud and loud, the doctor is a vociferous advocate of establishing one’s identity. “My sexuality or gender is not my whole identity. I have created a whole different world of my own where these are important aspects of my life, but never the whole of it,” he says.

‘We cannot ignore that queer identities are invisibilised’
For Gourab Ghosh, Pride Month has a specific meaning — standing up against oppression. “We cannot ignore that queer identities are invisibilised,” said Gourab, as he spoke about how Pride Month is celebrated in the month of June all over the world to remember a particular watershed moment in the global LGBTQIA+ movement. The educator further remembers the Stonewall Uprising that happened in 1969 in New York City.

“To make yourselves visible, one of the ways is to remember and re-remember the history of oppression and resistance of the queer people,” opined the rights activist.

“All effeminate or feminine men are not gay” — states Gourab, clearing one of the most common stereotypes. Another societal understanding regarding transgenders is also something that he wants to clear. “Transgender is an umbrella term under which there are a lot of other identities. I would want people to actually understand what transidentity is,” says Gourab.

‘Many believe that gay relationships put society in jeopardy’
For filmmaker Debalina Majumdar, Pride Month signifies celebrating their existence. A special date or a month denotes the importance of an event. The queer rights activist breaks the shackles through her films and documentaries — addressing various notions associated with the LGBTQIA+ community. “Any news related to the queer community on social media draws flak in the comments section, which further says a lot about the prevalent societal understanding,” says Debalina.

Debalina has come across misinformed comments on how the queer community in particular is ‘sex-starved’. The other understanding is “how society believes that gay relationships are a hindrance to progeny, thereby putting society in jeopardy” says Debalina. “It is an allegation towards the queer community, which is accompanied by the understanding that this community is perverse,” shared Debalina, who has made a documentary called Gay India Matrimony, which addresses various aspects of queer relationships.

‘Pride is a celebration of the freedom to live our lives the way we want, without discrimination’
Thirty-year-old professional make-up artist Biplab Das believes Pride Month is important because it is necessary to remember the past and the fact that people fought for the rights of the queer community, and paved the way for the way things are today. “It wasn’t always this free and comfortable for us. Pride Month celebrates our existence in society,” he said. He believes we should mark this just the way we would mark Independence Day, because Pride Month “is the celebration of the queer community’s freedom to live our lives exactly the way we wish to — without being discriminated against, bullied or judged”.

When it comes to stereotypes, Biplab thinks it is time people stopped ‘sex-shaming’ members of the LGBTQIA+ community. He feels society often finds them an easy target and assumes everyone queer is promiscuous. “People think we are all about sex. It is hard for them to understand that our choices or way of living is no different. They tend to judge a gay, trans or bi person simply on the preconceived notion that they are all about sex without knowing anything else about their lives.” He would like to see this mindset change and for people to stop judging anyone simply on their sexuality.

‘Pride is a celebration of everything we are, have been, and are deemed to be’
“If prejudice is deeply ingrained, the shame that results from experiencing that prejudice is ingrained many levels deeper,"" says Aavash Tulsyan. The entrepreneur and teacher believes that being ridiculed, teased, or harassed due to one's gender expression or sexual identity is, unfortunately, far too common. “Our skin is part Teflon, part scar tissue, and part broken glass. Pride is a celebration of everything we are, have been, and are deemed to be because we are so gorgeously unique,” he says.

“Pride is because we are, despite everything and everyone in our lives that has asked us to be otherwise,"" says the 29-year-old.

Aavash believes in breaking the stereotypes associated with the LGBTQIA+ community. Name-calling or stigmatising the queer individuals, calling them “sexual deviants, perverts, and predatory,” need to be put on a halt. “This notion is far too prevalent, particularly among men and women wrestling with their own insecurities and having trouble looking beyond the confines of externally enforced gender roles,” says Aavash.

Children growing up around members of the LGBTQIA+ community does not affect the young minds’ understanding — another prevalent notion that he wants to bust. “Having us around your children will not mess with their heads. In all likelihood, your kids will grow up with an appreciation of perspectives and realities that vary from their own, or they might recognise who they really are in the courage that we display,"" says Aavash.

The Hindu,2024-06-30 00:00:00,What is holding up the Teesta treaty? | Explained,"The story so far: During the recent state visit of Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of Bangladesh, to India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on June 22 said: “A technical team will soon visit Bangladesh to discuss conservation and management of the Teesta river in Bangladesh.” The remark triggered fresh speculation about the Teesta water sharing treaty with Bangladesh, a key bilateral agreement that has been pending between the two countries for over a decade.

 No talks on Teesta water sharing without involvement of Bengal Government, says Mamata Banerjee

What is India’s stand?
After Mr. Modi’s comment, Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra told the media that the discussion “between the two leaders was less about water sharing per se, and more about the management of the water flows within Teesta”. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee took issue with the Centre’s stand. On June 24, she wrote a letter to Mr. Modi conveying her strong reservation that no discussion on the sharing of Teesta waters should be taken up with Bangladesh without the involvement of the State.

 West Bengal not consulted on water pact with Bangladesh: Trinamool Congress

Why is Bengal upset?
Ms. Banerjee pointed out that if Teesta’s water is shared with Bangladesh, lakhs of people in north Bengal will get severely impacted. This is not the first time she has voiced her opposition to the proposed water sharing agreement of India with Bangladesh. In July 2019, the Trinamool Congress chairperson admitted that Bangladesh is hurt because the Teesta waters could not be shared and added, “If I had the ability, I would have definitely shared Teesta waters with them.” In 2017, the Chief Minister had also referred to an alternative proposal of sharing waters of the Torsa, Manshai, Sankosh and Dhansai rivers but not Teesta.

In all, 54 rivers flow between India and Bangladesh and sharing of river waters has been a key bilateral issue. India and Bangladesh agreed on the sharing of waters of the Ganga in 1996 after the construction of the Farakka Barrage and by the 2010s the issue of sharing of the Teesta came up for negotiation. In 2011, during the United Progressive Alliance-II government, India and Bangladesh were close to signing an agreement on the Teesta but Ms. Banerjee walked out of the deal, and since then, the agreement has been pending.

Also Read | What is the lowdown on sharing of Teesta waters?

What is the proposal?
In 2011, when the proposal for sharing Teesta water was drawn up, it was said India would get 42.5% and Bangladesh 37.5% of the river water from December to March.

A tributary of the Brahmaputra, the Teesta river originates from the Tso Lhamo Lake at an elevation of about 5,280 metres in north Sikkim. The river travels for about 150 km in Sikkim and 123 km in West Bengal, before entering Bangladesh from Mekhligunj in Cooch Behar district; it flows another 140 km in Bangladesh and joins the Bay of Bengal. Teesta is Bangladesh’s fourth largest trans-boundary river and its floodplain covers an area of 2,750 square kilometres in Bangladesh. But 83% of the river’s catchment area lies in India and the remaining 17% is in Bangladesh, supporting 8.5% of its population and 14% of its crop production.

 India and Bangladesh in talks for major river agreement ahead of PM Hasina’s visit

What are the political considerations?
While the Awami League government in Bangladesh is facing questions from the Opposition about the delay in inking an agreement on the Teesta, the dams for hydro-electric power generation in Sikkim and the Teesta Barrage Project at Gazoldoba in West Bengal is making the flow of the river erratic in Bangladesh, leading to either floods or scarcity of water. The visit of a technical team from India to discuss conservation of the Teesta in Bangladesh also comes amid the backdrop of China proposing major dredging work on the river and building reservoirs and embankments in 2020. The Bangladesh government has put the proposal on hold for the past four years.

Soon after returning to Bangladesh, Prime Minister Hasina announced that her country would accept India’s proposal to develop the Teesta River basin. Ms. Banerjee raised questions about the health of the Teesta river after the construction of a series of hydropower projects in Sikkim, deforestation in upper catchment areas and impact of climate change. She expressed surprise that no concrete steps have been taken by the Ministry of Jal Shakti to restore the river to its original form and health on the Indian side when a bilateral cooperation between India and Bangladesh for restoration of Teesta in Bangladesh is being proposed.

Environmental activists have also been raising questions on the ecological impact of hydro-electric projects on the river. In October 2023, a glacial lake outburst triggered floods in the Teesta basin that claimed hundred lives and destroyed the Teesta III hydroelectric dam.

Sharing of waters of transboundary rivers have been mandated by international laws including The Helsinki Rules on the Uses of the Waters of International Rivers in 1966. Article 253 of the Indian Constitution gives powers to the government to enter any transboundary river water-related treaty with a riparian state.

Why is Bengal talking about the Ganga treaty?
The Ganga water sharing treaty with Bangladesh completes 30 years in 2026 and a renewal of the agreement is on the cards. The Trinamool Congress chairperson has pointed out that water sharing with Bangladesh has changed the Ganga’s morphology and affected lakhs of people in West Bengal owing to river erosion.

“Lakhs of people have been displaced from their habitation rendering them homeless and also leading to their loss of livelihood. The reduced silt load in Hooghly has impeded the nourishment of the Sundarban delta,” she wrote in the letter to the Prime Minister.

","The Teesta water sharing treaty between India and Bangladesh remains unresolved despite ongoing discussions and historical negotiations. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has opposed any talks without state involvement, citing potential adverse impacts on local communities. The river, originating in Sikkim and flowing into Bangladesh, is crucial for both countries but faces challenges from hydroelectric projects and environmental concerns. Political considerations and international laws also influence the ongoing dialogue between the two nations.",Politics,74,973

The game-changing moment came in the 17th over when Hardik dismissed Klaasen, caught by Rishabh Pant. Miller remained, but struggled to find boundaries. Bumrah’s exceptional 18th over saw Marco Jansen’s wicket fall, leaving South Africa needing 20 off 12 balls.

Arshdeep Singh’s nerveless 19th over conceded just four runs. The decisive blow came in the final over, bowled by Hardik. Miller’s attempt to clear the boundary was spectacularly caught by Suryakumar, who juggled the ball while balancing on the rope.

The Hindu,2024-06-30 00:00:00,Om Birla | Chair of the House,"Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla’s re-election as the chair of the Lok Sabha after completing a full five-year term is being seen as part of the continuum that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is trying to establish between his last term and the current one.

After repeating nearly all Ministers in his Council of Ministers, and reappointing his earlier team of officials at the Prime Minister’s Office, the re-nomination of Mr. Birla as the National Democratic Alliance’s (NDA) candidate as Speaker was almost a given. Mr. Birla won, but not before some high drama with the Opposition fielding its own candidate and stopping just short of asking for a division of votes.

While this election of Mr. Birla had an air of inevitability around it, it wasn’t always the case. The choice of Mr. Birla for his first term as Speaker had taken everyone by surprise, including himself. Mr. Modi’s choice for Speaker in his first term as Prime Minister was the veteran Sumitra Mahajan, an eighth-term MP. In his second tenure, he picked Mr. Birla, a second-term MP from Kota, Rajasthan.

Mr. Birla, who began his career in student politics, in Kota, steadily climbed the party ladder while working at the youth wing of the BJP, the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM).

He went from the district unit head of the BJYM to its State president. He was elected to the Rajasthan legislature three times. His appointment as the Lok Sabha Speaker was a leap, both in profile and responsibility.

An RSS recruit, he was ideologically aligned to the Sangh Parivar, and had the trust of Mr. Modi, who had engaged with him on several occasions in the past with regard to politics in Rajasthan. Mr. Birla was evolving as an important resource from Rajasthan for the BJP’s national leadership, when this offer came his way.

First session
It was perhaps his experience as a backbencher in Parliament that helped him conduct the House smoothly in the early years. In the first session he presided over in 2019, all first time MPs got an opportunity to speak as he kept the Lok Sabha working till very late in the evening. A record 1,066 subjects were raised in the Zero Hour in the first session, another record.

When Pramila Bisoyi, a first term MP of the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) who had not even completed her primary education, kept avoiding all attempts to make her speak in Parliament, Mr. Birla sought her out to find out the reason only to discover that her hesitancy stemmed from her inability to speak either in Hindi or English. She spoke a local version of Odia. Mr. Birla then arranged an Odia to Hindi translator from among the Parliament staff, to help her speak.

When Ministers of the BJP-led government did not come up with satisfactory answers to questions by MPs on Question Hour, some got the sharp end of Mr. Birla’s tongue, with many Opposition MPs appreciating his efforts at ensuring everyone had their say in the House.

All this, however, was eclipsed when he created a new record by suspending 100 Opposition MPs in the Winter Session of 2023. And while everyone got a chance to speak, least number of government Bills went through parliamentary scrutiny. On the day he was re-elected as Speaker, Mr. Birla read out a statement condemning the Emergency— the Indira Gandhi-led Cabinet imposed Emergency 49 years ago — drawing protests from the Opposition.

The rough start raises questions on what approach Mr. Birla would take in his second term. Unlike in his first term, when the BJP had absolute majority in the House, this time, the BJP has formed a coalition government with NDA allies, and the Opposition seems resurgent.

Opposition MPs are hoping that Mr. Birla’s accommodative gestures from his previous tenure, in ensuring that all MPs get a chance to speak, and calling Ministers to account for not doing their parliamentary homework be the model he chooses to continue in his second tenure. But if he chooses to take the confrontational path, that could lead to showdowns. It is to be seen, which aspect of continuity he chooses to enforce.","Om Birla's re-election as Lok Sabha Speaker is viewed as part of PM Narendra Modi's continuity strategy. Initially a surprise pick, Birla's rise from youth politics to Speaker underscores BJP's trust in him. His first term saw proactive management and inclusivity, though marked by controversies like MP suspensions. As he begins his second term amidst a coalition government and resurgent opposition, his approach—whether accommodative or confrontational—remains pivotal.",Politics,67,694

India vs South Africa LIVE Score, T20 World Cup Final 2024

Slipping away
This time around, Rohit Sharma’s men displayed ice cool nerves in the face of pressure. 

The game seemed to slip away when South Africa got ahead in the chase, but the Men in Blue were unwilling to throw in the towel. Nothing could stop the Indians from wearing that coveted title.

When the job was done, Virat Kohli looked up the sky with hands aloft. 

 Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli announce retirement from T20Is after India’s World Cup win over South Africa

Rohit was mobbed by his teammates, and the support staff ran onto the ground with the National flag.

It was sweet, sweet redemption for Kohli, who came good with the bat when it mattered. 

His 59-ball 76 may not have set the pulse racing, but it immensely helped the team’s cause.

India found two more heroes in Jasprit Bumrah and Suryakumar Yadav. With a miserly 18th over, Bumrah tightened the screws on South Africa. 

Bumrah conceded two runs and picked up a wicket in those six balls, which put the Proteas in a corner.

The final nail in the coffin was driven by Suryakumar, who pulled off a brilliant catch to dismiss David Miller in the last over. A juggling effort from Suryakumar at long-off sent the last recognised batter back. South Africa was knocked out cold.

Challenging total
After winning the toss, India made a challenging 176 for seven. 

There was concern among the Indian fans at the Kensington Oval when the side slipped to 34 for three. India was forced to rebuild. Axar Patel and Kohli calmed nerves with sensible batting. 

Axar knew his role well, having performed this task against Pakistan earlier in the tournament.

 It's not what we did today but what we did for past 3-4 years: Rohit Sharma after win over South Africa

A 72-run fourth-wicket partnership was exactly what India needed to stay afloat. 

There could have been more, if not for a lazy piece of running from Axar. Though halfway down the track, Axar had time to turn back and make the crease.

Caught short
Axar, however, stopped in his track for a moment. Wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock took full advantage, throwing down the stumps at the bowler’s end to catch Axar short. 

Kohli’s desire to make it count was evident when he did not acknowledge cheers for his fifty. 

Using good technique and shots along the ground, Kohli stuck in for the long haul.

His effort paid rich dividend in the end. The nation rejoiced alongside Kohli and his mates.

The Hindu,2024-06-30 00:00:00,It's not what we did today but what we did for past 3-4 years: Rohit Sharma after win over South Africa,"Just as Rome wasn't built in a day, India's second T20 World Cup triumph wasn't about perfect execution of plans on the big day but a sum total of the team's quiet preparation over the past three years, an emotional skipper Rohit Sharma said here.

India defeated South Africa by seven runs in an engaging final to end a trophy drought that stretched for over a decade.

""I am completely lost and can't say what kind of emotions I am going through. Can't explain it in words. Let this sink in. Last night, I couldn't sleep as I was desperate and wanted it so badly. But I managed myself well inside the ground,"" Rohit said after becoming the third India captain after Kapil Dev and Mahendra Singh Dhoni to clinch a global title.

""Hard to sum up what we've been through in last three-four years. A lot behind the scenes, not what we did today, it's what we did before,"" said the skipper.

 Virat Kohli announces T20I retirement after India’s World Cup win over South Africa

He hasn't forgotten about the ODI World Cup defeat last year and knew that pressure needed to be soaked in.

""A lot of high-pressure games, and we've been on the wrong side of it. Guys understand when the pressure is on, what needs to be done, today was perfect example, we stuck together with backs to the wall."" The 37-year-old didn't forget to credit the team management and his fellow players for responding to his call.

""We wanted this really bad, a lot of minds need to come together, very proud of the bunch of boys and the management, giving us the liberty to play and that trust. Starts from management, coach, captain, and the players.""

Virat Kohli's form
I had no doubt about Kohli's form. He has played with Virat Kohli for more than 15 years and was confident that his poor run of form in the lead up to the final wasn't a headache.

""No-one was in doubt about the form of Virat, on top of his game for last 15 years. Come the occasion, big players stand up. Crucial to hold that end, for the others to play around him.

""...it wasn't a wicket to bat freely. He did that perfectly, that experience of all the years come together, and Axar's batting was crucial,"" he said, lauding the 47-run effort by Patel.

Don't know how Bumrah does it day in day out. Pace spearhed Jasprit Bumrah's skills are difficult to describe for a commoner but even the skipper feels that he is ill-equipped to sum up his artistry.

""Jasprit, I understand you guys trying to put it into words, but I don't know how he does it, it's just masterclass. He backs his skills which is more than enough, and is a confident lad. Class act,"" Rohit said about the player of the tournament.

Hardik was brilliant
After a rough IPL for Mumbai Indians, Hardik Pandya had a great T20 World Cup and his national skipper acknowledged the performance.

""Hardik was brilliant, to bowl that last over, proud of the boys. And the fans, from New York to Barbados, and back home. Late in India but they've been waiting a long time. Very proud of what we've achieved today."" As the skipper took a lap of honour with his daughter Samaira on his shoulders, the sense of contentment and elation was writ large on his face. Rohit Sharma deserved every bit of it.","Rohit Sharma, emotional after India's second T20 World Cup win, attributed their success not just to perfect execution on the final day but to years of quiet preparation. He praised the team's resilience in high-pressure situations and credited the management, players, and fans for their support.

The Hindu,2024-06-30 00:00:00,PUCL demands release of its executive committee member and other tribal activists,"The People’s Union For Civil Liberties (PUCL) on Saturday demanded the immediate release of all tribal activists who have been arrested in Chhattisgarh’s Bastar over the past few years, including PUCL executive committee member Suneeta Pottam.

“Release all Tribal activists and innocent villagers arrested in the last few years, including Sunita Pottam, Surju Tekam, and other Moolwasi Bahao Manch activists at the earliest; FIRs be lodged and police investigation be undertaken against the false cases filed against all Tribals including activists,” it said, also demanding that first information reports (FIRs) be filed regarding several recent encounters with security forces listed by the organisation.

It has also sought a judicial commission headed by a Supreme Court judge to enquire into those encounters; the creation of conditions for peace and security talks with the local population, Adivasi community, and the Communist Party of India (Maoist); an end to the targeting of democratic rights activists; and the lifting of all restrictions on democratic movements.

Encounter deaths
In a statement, PUCL alleged that over the past six months, more than 150 people in Bastar were killed in counter insurgency operations by security forces. “We also are concerned at the indiscriminate arrests of activists, in particular 26-year-old Suneeta Pottam, a young Tribal activist associated with the PUCL, and Moolvasi Bachao Manch senior activist Surju Tekam and others who are raising their voice against the unchecked human rights violation in Bastar,” it said.

“It should be known that Sunita Pottam as a minor, had filed a PIL along with another activist in the Supreme Court of India (SC) on the extra judicial killings taking place in Bastar, in 2017. She also went up to the National Human Rights Commission with similar complaints in 2022, along with the false cases that were filed against her. She also exposed through fact findings the sexual violence that took place in Bijapur in 2016,” the PUCL said.

The PUCL alleged that many of those killed in the encounters were ordinary villagers, some of whom had been identified as minors.

Activist arrested
“What is alarming is that instead of trying to build trust in the citizenry by holding independent probes into these incidents, the Chhattisgarh government has reacted by arresting one of the foremost activists from Bijapur... Suneeta Pottam, on June 3. Suneeta Pottam had protested the spate of extra judicial killings of villagers in Kadenar, Palnar, Korcholi, Andri, and Peddakorma in Bijapur in 2016 by gathering evidence that the deceased were ordinary villagers shot in cold blood, and filing a Public Interest Litigation on this before the Chhattisgarh High Court, seeking an independent Special Investigation Team to inquire into these,” said the PUCL.

Ms. Pottam is also a member of the national-level organisation, Women against Sexual Violence and State Repression, since 2015.","The People’s Union For Civil Liberties (PUCL) is demanding the release of tribal activists, including Suneeta Pottam, who have been arrested in Chhattisgarh's Bastar region over recent years.

The Telegraph,2024-06-30 00:00:00,It’s raining reels on Instagram as the monsoon rushes in,"The showers tiptoed in, from the middle of June, bringing relief to several parts of India. The skies turned grey and the pitter-patter sound of the rain brought aural solace. Rain has always been romanticised in songs and literature. It has been the muse for writers for ages. Now, in this digital world, where form of expression is also through short videos, rain is once again one of the most-loved topics. For this edition of the Reels of the week, My Kolkata picks some Instagram reels that beautifully portrays the monsoons.

Monsoon nights in Kolkata

In this reel, photographer and videographer @behaya_ portrays the beauty of Kolkata on a rainy night. The glowing Victoria Memorial against the gloomy sky, watching the drizzle under a streetlamp and observing each drop mingle into the river Hooghly — everything in this reel brings peace to the heart. The City of Joy, drenched in rain, is a different emotion altogether.Monsoon in Darjeeling
Rain in the hills always feels like a love story. The Queen of the Hills, Darjeeling, transforms into a love-stricken beauty. The mist is everywhere and the greenery is soothing.

If the hills feel a little too adventurous during the monsoon, you can always opt for the plains. Santiniketan, too, has its fair share of natural beauty during the months of June-August. You can spend time at a small tea shack and enjoy your cuppa or visit the Kopai and Khoai just before it rains. Take a walk in the breeze and watch the water and the grass sway. Check out this reel by @_kunal_chobi_wala. The video creator captures the floating monsoon clouds over the river. It feels like poem, but made into a reel.Railway station aesthetics
Pluviophile always find it fascinating when it rains. They get transported to a different world as it starts pouring. @arghya.dx, in his reel, imagines a railway station as a ‘rain station’ where the rain stops by, spends some time and moves forward. The umbrellas open and people take shelter under the shade. The platforms turn chaotic, but the reel only portrays the calmness. The calmness of the wet track, the over bridge getting drenched, objects lying around in the shower… it is all beautiful if you stop and watch.The first shower
Do you remember how, as children, getting drenched in the first monsoon showers felt like? Most people would say ecstatic! The joy of dancing in the rain after days of scorching heat felt so rejuvenating. But slowly, the ritual receded as we were told that the showers could make us fall ill. Animator and illustrator @artofchai found a father-son duo enjoying the rain on their terrace while their mother watches them dance. He picked up his stylus and made a digital art of the happy scene. It will surely take you down memory lane! Check it out.","Here is a summary of the article:

The long wait is over. India is world champion again.

In a classic ICC Men’s T20 World Cup final sure to be remembered for years to come, India made history with a nail-biting seven-run win over South Africa.

India vs South Africa LIVE Score, T20 World Cup Final 2024

Slipping away
This time around, Rohit Sharma’s men displayed ice cool nerves in the face of pressure. 

The game seemed to slip away when South Africa got ahead in the chase, but the Men in Blue were unwilling to throw in the towel. Nothing could stop the Indians from wearing that coveted title.

When the job was done, Virat Kohli looked up the sky with hands aloft. 

 Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli announce retirement from T20Is after India’s World Cup win over South Africa

Rohit was mobbed by his teammates, and the support staff ran onto the ground with the National flag.

It was sweet, sweet redemption for Kohli, who came good with the bat when it mattered. 

His 59-ball 76 may not have set the pulse racing, but it immensely helped the team’s cause.

India found two more heroes in Jasprit Bumrah and Suryakumar Yadav. With a miserly 18th over, Bumrah tightened the screws on South Africa. 

Bumrah conceded two runs and picked up a wicket in those six balls, which put the Proteas in a corner.

The final nail in the coffin was driven by Suryakumar, who pulled off a brilliant catch to dismiss David Miller in the last over. A juggling effort from Suryakumar at long-off sent the last recognised batter back. South Africa was knocked out cold.

Challenging total
After winning the toss, India made a challenging 176 for seven. 

There was concern among the Indian fans at the Kensington Oval when the side slipped to 34 for three. India was forced to rebuild. Axar Patel and Kohli calmed nerves with sensible batting. 

Axar knew his role well, having performed this task against Pakistan earlier in the tournament.

A 72-run fourth-wicket partnership was exactly what India needed to stay afloat. 

There could have been more, if not for a lazy piece of running from Axar. Though halfway down the track, Axar had time to turn back and make the crease.

Caught short
Axar, however, stopped in his track for a moment. Wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock took full advantage, throwing down the stumps at the bowler’s end to catch Axar short. 

Kohli’s desire to make it count was evident when he did not acknowledge cheers for his fifty. 

Using good technique and shots along the ground, Kohli stuck in for the long haul.

His effort paid rich dividend in the end. The nation rejoiced alongside Kohli and his mates.

The committee comprising Ministers Atishi, Saurabh Bharadwaj and Imran Hussain will submit its report to Forest Minister Gopal Rai, a statement said. It will further be submitted to the Supreme Court, which is seized of the matter and will be holding the next hearing over it on July 11.

Mr. Rai, in a statement, said, “A shocking incident has come to light from Chhatarpur, Satbari, that in February, the DDA violated all rules and cut 1,100 trees without permission from any agency or government.The court is repeatedly asking the vice-chairperson of the DDA on whose orders 1,100 trees were cut illegally.”

‘Notices ignored’
“The e-mails of DDA engineers reveal that the trees were cut on the verbal instructions of the Lieutenant-Governor,” Mr. Rai claimed.

He said at a meeting of the Forest Department on June 26, department officials told him that the DDA was issued notices on March 5 and 22 by them on the matter but they did not respond.

The Supreme Court had recently found the inability of the DDA to unearth information or official records to shed light on whether L-G V.K. Saxena ordered the cutting of trees in the protected area as sheer disingenuity. The L-G is the DDA Chairman.

They turned themselves in before senior police and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) officials here stating that they were disappointed by the atrocities committed by Maoists on tribals and the “inhuman” and “hollow” Maoist ideology, district superintendent of police Jitendra Kumar Yadav said.

Two women were among the surrendered cadres who were active under the Bhairamgarh, Gangaloor and national park area committees of Maoists, Yadav told reporters.

Of the twelve, Munna Modiyam (23), a platoon party committee member (PPCM) of the national park area committee, was carrying a reward of Rs 5 lakh on his head, the official said.

His wife Janani Modiyam (23), who was the head of Chetna Naatya Mandli, cultural wing of Maoists, in the same formation, carried a reward of Rs 1 lakh on her head, the SP added.

Raju Punem (29) was active as head of Pusnar DAKMS (Dandakaranya Adivasi Kisan Majdoor Sangthan- a frontal wing of Maoists) and carried a reward of Rs 1 lakh, he said.

The surrendered Naxalites were provided instant assistance of Rs 25,000 each, the official said, adding that they will be provided benefits as per the Surrender and Rehabilitation Policy of the state government.

The New Indian Express,2024-06-30 00:00:00,"Israeli tanks advance into areas in north and south Gaza, fighting rages","sraeli forces advanced further on Sunday into the Shejaia neighbourhood of northern Gaza and also pushed deeper into western and central Rafah in the south, killing at least six Palestinians and destroying several homes, residents said.

Israeli tanks, which moved back into Shejaia four days ago, fired shells towards several houses, leaving families trapped inside and unable to leave, the residents said.

The Israeli military said forces operating in Shejaia had over the past day killed several Palestinian gunmen, located weapons, and struck military infrastructure. On Saturday it announced the death of two Israeli soldiers in northern Gaza.

The armed wing of Hamas and the allied Islamic Jihad reported fierce fighting in both Shejaia and Rafah, saying their fighters had fired anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs against Israeli forces operating there.

More than eight months into Israel's air and ground war in Gaza, militants continue to stage attacks on Israeli forces, operating in areas that the Israeli army said it had gained control over months ago.

Arab mediators' efforts, backed by the United States, have so far failed to secure a ceasefire. Hamas says any deal must end the war and bring a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Israel says it will accept only temporary pauses in the fighting until Hamas, which has governed Gaza since 2007, is eradicated.

RAFAH DEATHS

In Rafah, near the border with Egypt, Israeli tanks pushed deeper into several districts in the east, west and centre of the city, and medics said six people had been killed in an Israeli strike on a house in Shaboura, in the heart of the city.

The six bodies from the Zurub family were transferred to Nasser Hospital in the nearby city of Khan Younis. On Sunday, dozens of relatives paid their respects before the bodies, which were wrapped in white shrouds, and then carried them in their arms to prepared graves.

Residents said the Israeli army had torched the Al-Awda mosque in the centre of Rafah, one of the city's best-known.

Israel has said its military operations in Rafah are aimed at eradicating the last armed battalions of Hamas.

The Israeli military said on Sunday its forces continued ""targeted, intelligence-based"" operations in Rafah, killing several gunmen in different encounters and dismantling tunnels.

The latest Gaza war erupted when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

Israel's retaliatory offensive has so far killed nearly 38,000 people, according to the Gaza health ministry, and has left the heavily built-up coastal enclave in ruins.

The Gaza health ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants but officials say most of the dead are civilians. More than 300 Israeli soldiers have been killed in Gaza and Israel says at least a third of the Palestinian dead are fighters.","Israeli forces have continued their advance into the Shejaia neighborhood of northern Gaza and into western and central Rafah in the south, resulting in the deaths of at least six Palestinians and the destruction of several homes.

The Hindu,2024-06-30 00:00:00,Why has the NTA failed to deliver?,"The story so far: The National Testing Agency (NTA) has come under intense fire over the past few weeks, with widespread allegations of cheating, paper leaks and other irregularities impacting flagship examinations such as the NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) for undergraduate medical college admissions and the UGC-NET for Ph.D and assistant professor appointments. The agency’s director general, Subodh Kumar Singh, has been removed, the CBI is probing irregularities, and a high-level panel has been set up to create a roadmap for a systemic overhaul.

EDITORIAL | Testing times: On the need to mend the National Testing Agency

What is the NTA?
The NTA was set up in 2017 as a specialist, self-sustaining and autonomous organisation under the aegis of the Union Education Ministry. Its director general and governing body are appointed by the Union government. However, it is registered as a society and is a separate legal entity, which raises questions about the government’s legal liability for the NTA’s actions. Its main mandate is to conduct efficient, transparent and international standard tests to assess the competency of candidates for admission, and recruitment purposes. Soon after it was established, the NTA took over the conduct of major all-India examinations, such as the JEE for engineering college admissions, NEET-UG, and UGC-NET (both of which had previously been conducted by the Central Board for Secondary Education or CBSE), as well as the entrance tests for Jawaharlal Nehru University and Delhi University. The National Education Policy of 2020 envisaged a broader role, recommending that the NTA conduct an entrance or aptitude test for all universities across the country. In all, the NTA now has charge for more than 20 examinations.


Why have there been so many problems?
One of the main problems is that the NTA was originally intended to conduct computer-based tests only. “This will ensure that high volume can be processed in a short period of time,” says the agency’s website, claiming that such online testing will “eliminate the possibility of leakage of questions and question papers, post-test malpractice of filling in the OMR sheets, late entry of students to cheat in the test, subjectivity errors on descriptive testing, etc...In a short period of three years, all the tests administered by NTA will be computer adaptive. This will completely eliminate the problem of cheating,” it declares. Thus, when the NTA took over conduct of the UGC-NET examination from the CBSE six years ago, it was converted from a pen-and-paper examination to a computer-adaptive test. This year, however, for reasons that are unclear, UGC-NET shifted back to the pen-and-paper mode. The day after it was conducted for over 11 lakh aspirants, the government cancelled the examination, citing inputs from the cyber crime unit. “Pen-and-paper is a heaven for scamsters,” said one former official, noting that the printing process is particularly vulnerable to leaks. It is interesting that when the government announced fresh dates for UGC-NET 2024 to be held again, it also stipulated that it would be a computer-adaptive test this time.

However, when the conduct of NEET-UG was taken over by the NTA, the Health Ministry flatly refused to allow it to shift to a computer-based exam, citing concerns about students in rural areas who would not be prepared for an online exam, as well as Supreme Court rulings on how the examination should be conducted. Hence, the NTA has been forced to run a major examination in a mode that it was never intended to implement by design.

 The allegations over NEET-UG 2024 | Explained

Officials and educationists note that the agency is severely understaffed for the role it is currently being asked to undertake. According to a senior official, the agency was set up with only about 25 permanent staff positions. A number of its functions have also been outsourced to technical partners from the very beginning. Given that NEET-UG alone had more than 23 lakh candidates writing the examination in almost 5,000 centres across the country and abroad, this has left the agency stretched thin, according to some officials. “The NTA was set up to be a lean, professional organisation. The more people, the higher risks. The NIC [National Informatics Centre] simply does not have the capacity or IT infrastructure needed, so it was always meant to engage third-party technical partners which have the robust cyber security expertise needed to run large-scale computer based examinations,” said R. Subrahmanyam, former Higher Education Secretary who was in charge at the time the NTA was set up. However, some educationists have complained that engaging third-party players takes accountability out of the government’s hands and leaves loopholes in the system which can be exploited by unscrupulous players.

Officials say the NTA has also failed to develop robust mechanisms needed to handle a large-scale pen-and-paper examination, including the setting of the question paper and its encryption, selection of external printing presses and exam centres, transportation to printing presses, storage and distribution to examinees at examination centres and then the collection and transportation of answer sheets to evaluation centres. Each of these is a stage where malpractice can occur without robust security mechanisms.

What is the way ahead?
The high-level panel headed by former ISRO chief K. Radhakrishnan has been given two months to recommend reforms in the examination process, improve data security protocols, and overhaul the NTA’s functioning.

Educationists, however, propose starkly different pathways for the future. One option is to add manpower and infrastructure to the NTA to equip it to take on large-scale pen-and-paper examinations in an improvement to the CBSE system that preceded it. Those recommending this return to the past point out that pen-and-paper examinations are more equitable, especially for students in rural and remote areas with little access to technology.

 Centre's panel on exam reforms seeks suggestions from stakeholders till July 7

Another option is to dismantle the centralisation process that seeks to move all testing in the country under the NTA. Some State governments, and professors from individual universities, notably JNU, have called for entrance tests for their institutions to be removed from the NTA and handed back to the institutions themselves, arguing that more decentralised structures are needed to meet the vastly differing needs of institutions.

However, others seek a more radical reform of the assessment system. They suggest systemic changes to remove the single, high-stakes entrance examination which results in extreme pressure on students, encourages an inequitable coaching industry, and incentivises malpractice. Instead, periodic assessments of knowledge, concept-based understanding, and aptitude can be conducted in the final years of school education as the precursor to the admission process, using online testing, and AI-based proctoring which can be overseen by the NTA.

","The National Testing Agency (NTA) has faced severe criticism recently due to allegations of cheating, paper leaks, and other irregularities in exams like NEET and UGC-NET. Originally set up for computer-based tests, NTA has struggled with logistical challenges and a lack of adequate staffing. A high-level panel led by former ISRO chief K. Radhakrishnan aims to reform the examination process and improve data security. Debates include whether to enhance NTA's capabilities for large-scale pen-and-paper exams or decentralize testing back to individual institutions. Some propose replacing high-stakes entrance exams with periodic assessments to reduce student pressure and malpractice.",Education,97,1107

Ms. Patel is the national president of the Apna Dal (Soneylal), an ally of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in U.P.

The government also said that applicants were given grades; no one was rejected with “not suitable” remarks; and the candidates’ personal details were not shown to interviewers.

“The candidates from OBC and SC/ST communities are constantly contacting me and saying that they are often declared ‘Not Found Suitable’ for the posts reserved for them in various competitive examinations conducted by the State government that have an interview-based recruitment process. Later, these posts are declared unreserved,” Ms. Patel said in her letter of June 27 to Mr. Adityanath. This angered the job aspirants from these communities, she added.

Sources said the State government took Ms. Patel’s allegations seriously and the Chief Minister’s Office asked the concerned department to reply to the Union Minister.

In the reply sent to Ms. Patel, Additional Chief Secretary, Department of Appointment and Personnel, Devesh Chaturvedi, said the Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission (UPPSC) submitted that the interview process was based on coding, with the candidate’s name, registration, roll number, category, and age covered. In this way, personal details were not placed before the interview board.

“....the interview board does not mention ‘not suitable’ in the mark sheet, but the candidate is provided with grade which is converted into marks to be noted in the final mark-sheets,” Mr. Chaturvedi’s letter said.

Additional Chief Secretary also said that if candidates of the given categories did not clear the exam for the given vacancies, then the UPPSC did not have the right to convert the resulting unfilled vacancies to any other category.

“... rather such vacancies are carried forward by taking action according to the procedure prescribed in the Government Order,” the letter said.","Union Minister Anupriya Patel alleged bias against OBC, SC, and ST applicants in government jobs in Uttar Pradesh. The Yogi Adityanath-led state government responded, clarifying that quota posts remaining vacant cannot be converted to unreserved posts. The government emphasized that the interview process uses coding to hide candidates' personal details from interviewers and that candidates are graded rather than rejected with ""not suitable"" remarks. Any unfilled vacancies for reserved categories are carried forward as per prescribed procedures, rather than being reassigned to other categories.",Politics,84,365
The Hindu,2024-06-30 00:00:00,"Guide, not pamper","“Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through the experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, ambition inspired, and success achieved.”

— Helen Keller

In today’s world, parents often unknowingly craft their children into “snowflakes”, moulding them into fragile beings with an entitlement syndrome. Excessive pampering has become a show of false prestige among new-generation parents. They believe that showering unconditional love and arranging everything for their children without them asking is true parenting. However, this approach leads to negative outcomes in child development, fostering a sense of entitlement where everything is taken for granted.

A small setback in their life path makes them intolerant and unable to cope, as they have never faced discomfort before. They lack resilience, they start blaming others for their failures. Overprotected children, shielded from failure, struggle to deal with challenges, hindering their own growth.

Recent times have shown the detrimental effects of excessive pampering, with children from affluent families engaging in reckless behaviour, causing fatal accidents and committing crimes. Parents often try to shield them from consequences, mistaking it for love.

The real creators of vulnerable and emotionally fragile children are the parents. While some parents proudly exhibit these traits in society, they must realise the negative impact of excessive pampering and exhibiting love.

Working parents seek asylum under the busy and hectic lifestyle for not able to “carve a niche” in child parenting, but it’s a most dangerous mistake as children develop a hateful attitude towards society in general and towards parents in particular. Every parent shall take out time to have his or her part in developing a child. No excuses allowed.

In our country, parents are more concerned about their child’s education and career. Many parents insist their child become an IITian or a doctor. In this process, students are subjected to rigorous routines in coaching centres, exerting tremendous pressure upon them. We have seen many students taking drastic decisions to escape the torture and fear of studies. They fear failure, their parents’ status in society, disgraced comments from tutors, and guilt from unsuccessful attempts. For all these reasons, they take their own lives.

For guiding children in career selection or choosing higher education, there are specialist services available in the market to customise for individuals based on the interests of children and various parameters. We can always seek services from experts, rather than pressuring children to imitate others.

Parents can follow some simple yet effective practices to prepare their children to face any hardship in their life’s endeavours:

Encourage independence: allow children to solve problems on their own. This helps them develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

Set realistic expectations: teach children that failure is a part of life and an opportunity to learn and grow. Encourage them to take on challenges and praise their efforts rather than just their successes. Set achievable goals keeping in view of the realistic capacity of children.

Teach resilience: teach children how to handle setbacks. Share your experiences of failure and how you overcame them.

Provide support, not solutions: offer emotional support and guidance, but let children find their own solutions. This fosters self-confidence and independence.

Striking a balance between love and discipline is crucial in nurturing resilient and responsible individuals. Children need to experience challenges and failures to learn and grow. It’s time for parents to rethink their parenting approach and prioritise building character and resilience in their children for a brighter future.","The quote by Helen Keller emphasizes that character develops through trials and suffering, not ease. Today's parenting trends often overprotect children, leading to entitlement and lack of resilience. This approach, aiming to shield from failure, can hinder personal growth. Parents are urged to balance love with discipline, encouraging independence, setting realistic expectations, teaching resilience, and providing support rather than solutions to foster character and resilience in children.",Human Interest,67,575
The Hindu,2024-06-30 00:00:00,"India’s a story of many transitions, says former RBI Governor Duvvuri Subbarao","From a closed economy to an open economy, from agriculture to the hub of digital innovations and services, from glaring gender inequality to gender parity, India’s is a story of many transitions, said former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Duvvuri Subbarao.

He was delivering a lecture in the latest edition of India Forward, a talk series organised by the Cochin Chamber of Commerce and Industry here on (June 29) Saturday.

He said India had transformed itself from a highly poverty-ridden country to a country that is sure-footed in its fight against absolute poverty. “Girl children are no longer examples of poverty and malnutrition. They embody great ambitions. Women in today’s India want to be astronauts, civil servants, economists, and journalists,” he added.

Mr. Subbarao pointed to the great success of the midday meal programme where hundreds of children received a meal a day in school. This helped improve enrolment in schools. The dropout rates came down, he said.

He recalled that he was the RBI Governor at a time when the world economy went through great turbulence. In a lighter vein, he said the troubles that started with his tenure as RBI Governor ended when he stepped down.

He also released his latest book Just a Mercenary? Notes from My Life and Career on the occasion.

M. Ramachandran, former Secretary in the Ministry of Urban Affairs, asked Mr. Subbarao what inspired him to choose the book title. “The question,” he said, “is why I was doing it. Was my career meant to earn money like a mercenary, who fought for those who paid him? Or was it out of a sense of duty, or was it a sense of giving back to society, which had given me so much?”

Mr. Ramachandran also recalled how Mr. Subbarao, while in Kerala years ago, thought of how migrant workers in the State sent home money. “Financial inclusion is meaningful when poor families are included in the banking system, where they can access credit and insurance cover,” Mr. Subbarao said.","Former RBI Governor Duvvuri Subbarao discussed India's economic transitions from a closed to open economy, advancements in gender parity, and successes like the midday meal program in a recent lecture for the Cochin Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

The New Indian Express,2024-06-30 00:00:00,"Global Compact on AI needed; for India, AI to be gamechanger in citizen services: Salesforce CEO Arundhati Bhattacharya","AI’s cross-border nature will require a ‘Global Compact’ to ensure its benefits reach all of humanity and to safeguard against any potential misuse, Arundhati Bhattacharya, the top boss of Salesforce India has said exuding confidence that for India, Artificial Intelligence will be a “gamechanger” in delivery of public services.

Bhattacharya, the CEO and Chairperson of Salesforce India and former Chairperson of the SBI, said that AI is poised to bring about a transformation in every sphere – from healthcare to diagnostics, and education to skilling.

The advent of this futuristic technology will benefit India in a big way, firing the engines of public service delivery, at scale and lower cost, she observed.

In an interview with PTI, Bhattacharya also highlighted the need for a `Global Compact’ on AI, given the cross-border nature of technology and its impact. Bhattacharya said she is convinced that AI would benefit society, but in the wrong hands it can be prove to be “quite harmful” and advocated “caution”.

“AI is like any other tool, you can use it for good purposes, or you can use it for bad. So one needs to be careful. I am not scared but I would definitely recommend caution…I would recommend that we are careful about what we do with AI, and how we do it,” she said.

Just like climate issues, AI too goes beyond country borders, and hence requires Global Compact, consensus, and international efforts, according to her.

“I think there need to be a Global Compact on this as well. This is not something that is going to remain enclosed within borders of a country, it will impact people globally…AI is not going to be a respecter of borders of a country,” he said.

AI, at this point, is largely self-regulated, she noted.

“AI will need a global compact, it will need people to agree that there are possible ways that AI can be used that would be harmful to mankind…They would need to come together and have some kind of understanding to ensure that we use this tool for betterment of mankind…,” Bhattacharya said.

Bhattacharya smashed the glass ceiling in 2013 when she became the first woman to lead State Bank of India (SBI) in the bank’s over 200-year history. She retired from SBI in 2017 and went on to reinvent herself with a brand new career innings at the helm of cloud-based service provider Salesforce India in 2020, as Chairperson and CEO – a position she has held since.

Describing the advent of AI as a “gamechanger” and “blessing” for India, Bhattacharya said she is convinced that the technology will bring transformation all across, benefiting society.

“India does not have paucity of manpower, what it needs is technology for us to enable each of those people to reach optimum potential. To do that through brick-and mortar is difficult in terms of bandwidth and costs…if AI can deliver the first layer of it, and offer us insights to determine what exactly is needed, it will ensure fair distribution…it will be a great step forward,” she said.

It is pertinent to mention that while immense potential of AI to positively impact society has been widely-recognised by policymakers across the world, the potential dangers and risks around the new technology are also driving global conversations and parleys around need for safety brakes, and responsible, human-centric governance framework for Artificial Intelligence.","Arundhati Bhattacharya, CEO and Chairperson of Salesforce India, has called for a ""Global Compact"" on artificial intelligence (AI) to ensure its benefits are accessible to all and to prevent misuse. Bhattacharya believes that AI will be a ""game-changer"" for India's public services, with applications in healthcare, education, and skilling. However, she also warns of the potential harm if AI falls into the wrong hands, advocating for caution and responsible use. Like climate issues, AI crosses borders and requires international collaboration and consensus to regulate its use effectively. Bhattacharya suggests that a Global Compact on AI is necessary, as the technology affects people globally and is not limited by national borders. She emphasizes the need for understanding and agreement on using AI for the betterment of humanity. Bhattacharya, who broke barriers as the first woman to lead the State Bank of India, sees AI as a tool to enable India's vast workforce and ensure fair distribution of opportunities. However, she acknowledges the need for safety measures and responsible governance to address the risks associated with AI.",Technology and Gadgets,175,562
The New Indian Express,2024-06-30 00:00:00,"Temple trail: Rishi Sunak, Keir Starmer both woo British Hindu voters","While Sunak was at the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Neasden to promise
to keep trying to “make the community proud”, Starmer chose another north
London Swaminarayan Temple in Kingsbury to reiterate his commitment to
building a “strategic partnership with India”.

On the final weekend of campaigning ahead of the UK general election on Thursday, both Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and the man who is fighting for his job at 10 Downing Street – Labour Leader Keir Starmer, have hit the temple trail to woo British Hindu voters.

While 44-year-old Sunak was at the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Neasden on Sunday to promise to keep trying to “make the community proud”, 61-year-old Starmer chose another north London Swaminarayan Temple in Kingsbury on Friday to reiterate his commitment to building a “strategic partnership with India”.

The move follows a ‘Hindu Manifesto' being launched by an umbrella group of British Hindu organisations for the first time ahead of a British general election, calling on elected representatives to take proactive steps to protect Hindu places of worship and tackle anti-Hindu hate.

""This mandir stands as a great statement of the contributions that this community makes to Britain,” said Sunak, in his speech at the iconic Neasden Temple, where he offered prayers and sought blessings from the elderly in the gathering.

“Education, hard work, family, those are my values. Those are your values. Those are Conservative values,” he declared in his election pitch.

Meanwhile, Starmer was welcomed to the tunes of an India-Scottish pipe band at the Kingsbury Temple, where he also began his speech in the same way as Sunak with “Jai Swaminarayan”.

""If we're elected next week, we will strive to govern in the spirit of sewa to serve you and a world in need,” said the Labour Leader, reiterating a previous message that there is “absolutely no place for Hinduphobia in Britain”.

According to the 2021 census, around 1 million people living in Britain identify as Hindus, making this electorate quite a sizable chunk in the July 4 general election.

""The 'Hindu Manifesto' is a call to action for all parliamentary candidates and political parties to engage with and support the Hindu
community in their constituencies,” says the Hindus for Democracy group behind the initiative.

""It highlights the contributions of Hindus to the UK's social, cultural and economic fabric and seeks to build a future where these contributions are recognised, valued, protected and promoted for a better future for all,” the group said.

While the incumbent Sunak-led Tories have been trailing in all pre-election surveys, how the diaspora votes line up this time with Britain's first Indian heritage Prime Minister in the race remains to be seen.

""For the Conservative Party, obviously, they have Rishi Sunak – a British Indian leader – for the first time. It's an unknown factor how much it will matter to British Indian voters that the leader of the party is from their background,” notes Sunder Katwala, Director of the British Future think tank.

With just days to go before polling day on Thursday, both leaders are expected to undertake a so-called campaign blitz – zig-zagging different parts of the United Kingdom including other places of worship to clinch any remaining undecided votes.","Both British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Labour Leader Keir Starmer have visited Hindu temples in an attempt to woo British Hindu voters ahead of the UK general election.

Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu of running a “mitron ki sarkar (government of
friends)”, for preferring his associates for posts that enjoy Cabinet rank in the state.
On Friday, Sukhu’s Principal Media Adviser Naresh Chauhan, one of those in the
BJP’s crosshairs, asked what was wrong with the CM helping “friends” who had
stood by him in times of crises. “The BJP is repeatedly talking about ‘mitron ki
sarkar’. Should enemies be given a place in the government?” he said, during an
interaction with mediapersons in Hamirpur.","The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has accused the Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister, Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu, of running a government that prioritizes his associates and friends since he took office in 2022. Dubbed a ""mitron ki sarkar"" or a government of friends by the BJP, Sukhu has been alleged to have granted cabinet positions to his close allies in the state.

Sukhu's Principal Media Adviser, Naresh Chauhan, has defended the Chief Minister's actions, stating that there is no wrongdoing in supporting friends who stood by Sukhu during difficult times. Chauhan questions whether Sukhu should appoint enemies instead of those who have been loyal to him.

This exchange occurred during a media interaction in Hamirpur. The BJP has consistently raised concerns about nepotism and favoritism in Sukhu's appointments, accusing him of disregarding merit in favor of personal relationships. The notion of a ""mitron ki sarkar"" suggests that the Chief Minister is prioritizing loyalty to friends over effective governance and the well-being of the state.

Vargas, who plays his club football in Germany for Augsburg, made it 2-0 just 27 seconds into the second half when he picked up Michel Aebischer’s pass near the left-hand corner of the Italy area and expertly bent the ball into the far top corner of the net.

Italy did not manage a shot on target until the 73rd minute and their best effort before then came when Switzerland defender Fabian Schar headed Nicolo Fagioli’s cross against his own post, with Yann Sommer stranded.

The Hindu,2024-06-30 00:00:00,SP’s Awadhesh Prasad could be Opposition’s Deputy Speaker candidate,"he Opposition is likely to field Faizabad MP and Samajwadi Party leader Awadhesh Prasad, for the post of Deputy Speaker. Learning from their experience during the Speaker’s election, where differences between Congress and Trinamool Congress came to the fore, the Opposition has decided to present a united front to force a contest for the position.

Though constitutionally mandated, the 17th Lok Sabha functioned without a Deputy Speaker. Besides speculation, there has been no formal indication from the government that the position will be filled in the 18th Lok Sabha either.

Also read | Preaching consensus, provoking confrontation

Article 93 of the Constitution mandates that the Lok Sabha shall, “as soon as may be”, choose a member to be the Deputy Speaker. However, it does not provide a specific time frame.

According to sources, top leadership of Congress, Trinamool and SP — the three leading Opposition parties of the INDIA bloc — had informal talks to pick a consensus candidate who could send a strong message.

The leaders narrowed down their choice to Mr. Prasad, a nine-time MLA and first-time MP who hit the headlines for defeating BJP’s two-time MP Lallu Singh in the Faizabad Lok Sabha seat. The recently consecrated Ram Temple in Ayodhya, which the BJP had hoped would see them through to an easy majority, falls within this Lok Sabha seat.

“Mr. Prasad’s victory symbolises the defeat of BJP’s Hindutva agenda. As a Dalit leader, his victory from a general seat was also an extremely significant moment in Indian political history,” a top Opposition leader said. If the government does not make a move to appoint a Deputy Speaker before the first session of Parliament ends on July 3, the Opposition will be writing to Lok Sabha speaker on the issue, sources said.

A Deputy Speaker enjoys the same legislative powers as a Speaker. And in the absence of the Speaker because of death, illness or any other reason, the Deputy Speaker also assumes the administrative powers. It is parliamentary convention to elect a Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha from a party other than the ruling party to run an accountable democratic parliament

Traditionally, the position is reserved for the single largest Opposition party but not all governments have followed this norm. In 2014, in the first term of the Narendra Modi government, the post was accorded to BJP ally AIADMK’s Thambi Durai. In 2004 and 2009, when the Congress-led UPA government was in power, Shiromani Akali Dal MP Charanjit Singh Atwal and BJP MP Kariya Munda held the position. During the Atal Behari Vajpayee government, Congress’s P.M. Sayeed held the position.","The Opposition plans to field Faizabad MP and Samajwadi Party leader Awadhesh Prasad for the Deputy Speaker post. Learning from past disagreements, parties like Congress, Trinamool Congress, and SP aim to present a united front.

The Hindu,2024-06-30 00:00:00,NTA’s plan to add more online exam centres languishes in cold storage,"The National Testing Agency (NTA), which is under scrutiny for multiple question paper leak controversies, failed to amp up its infrastructure for conducting tests in online mode in 2024, as its tender to multiply testing centres failed to take off, The Hindu has learnt.

The NTA had floated a tender in January this year, in order to increase its capacity of computer labs, which could house ‘nodes’, or seating spaces for candidates, in as many as 378 cities. “The work has not progressed as the tenders haven’t been finalised,” a top NTA official told The Hindu. 

 NTA announces fresh dates for UGC-NET, CSIR UGC-NET, NCET exams amid raging row over alleged irregularities

If the tender had gone through, the NTA had aimed to conduct exams across India in a standardised format by establishing online exam centres without any possibility of malpractice, officials added.

Safer computer-based testing
Currently, the NTA conducts at least six of its entrance exams through the relatively safer online or computer based test (CBT) mode. While the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE-Main) which paves the way for engineering college admissions is conducted by the NTA through the CBT mode, the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET-UG) for medical aspirants is conducted in a pen-and-paper or offline mode. Pen-and-paper tests like NEET-UG are more vulnerable to paper leaks and other types of malpractice. 

According to official data, the NTA currently has the infrastructure capability for approximately 600 CBT examination centres spread across India. 

 Fresh date for NEET-PG to be announced within two days, says Dharmendra Pradhan

“It conducts CBT exams in multiple shifts with multiple sets of question papers due to the limited infrastructure availability as per the defined standards for conducting online exams,” another NTA official said. 

Boosting capacity
“Currently, India does not have the capacity to conduct online exams for more than three lakh candidates in a single shift due to resource constraints,” V. Kamakoti, Director of IIT-Madras told The Hindu.

Aware of its restraints, the NTA had envisioned setting up more exam centres for online exams, first for 40,000 candidates per shift and then to increase the capacity to 2,00,000 candidates per shift, with a capacity of 275 computer nodes in each centre. Each node would seat one candidate.  

This would mean gradually doubling the existing strength of 600 centres, by adding anywhere between 145 to 700 more centres. “But the tender never took off,” officials said. 

 SC, Delhi HC seek NTA response on pleas raising grievances on OMR sheets and out-of-syllabus questions in NEET-UG

“The NTA had planned to start with a provision of approximately 40,000 computer nodes per shift and will increase the nodes on mutual discussion or as per industry requirement. At present candidates from remote areas need to travel a long distance from their residence to reach the exam centres,” the tender floated by the NTA said. 

‘Eye-opener’
Multiple proposals to administer NEET-UG exams through online mode were sent to the Ministry of Education but in vain, officials at the NTA told The Hindu. “Talks for administering the NEET-UG in CBT mode, similar to JEE (Mains), have been ongoing for at least five years now. The recent paper leak fiasco should serve as an eye-opener to change the format of the exams,” an NTA official quoted above said. 

In the tender floated in January, the NTA had sought proposals from profitable private companies or central PSUs, who have had an average annual turnover of ₹100 crore for the last five years, and who have handled projects ranging from ₹20 crore to ₹40 crore, to bid for setting up and maintaining online exam centres. 

 Centre's panel on exam reforms seeks suggestions from stakeholders till July 7

In the tender, the NTA said that it wanted to set up this infrastructure in private and government higher education institutions and schools, government and semi-government buildings which would offer areas in their campuses for the development of new IT infrastructure by outsourcing it to a private company or a PSU. 

Outsourced centres
The NTA wanted to outsource the work to bidders for end-to-end execution and running of online examination centres, including arranging infrastructure like furniture, electrification, air-conditioning, power back up, network cabling, internet with minimum 10 mbps speed, CCTV, and support manpower to operate and maintain centres, and even arrange a pool of invigilators which will be maintained by the bidders in individual cities. 

The tender floated in January never took off, and is currently facing a delay of nearly six months. Had it been awarded, the NTA had expected the online centres to be live and running within three months of awarding the contract, and had said that successful bidders were expected to run the online exam centres for a five year period. 

","The National Testing Agency (NTA) failed to enhance its infrastructure for conducting online tests in 2024 as its tender to increase testing centers was not finalized. The tender, issued in January, aimed to expand computer lab capacity across 378 cities but saw no progress. Currently, the NTA has about 600 CBT examination centers. Plans to establish more centers to accommodate 40,000 candidates per shift and eventually 200,000 were stalled. The delay of nearly six months hampers efforts to mitigate malpractices associated with pen-and-paper exams like NEET-UG.

The meeting, led by Defence Secretary A. Giridhar, with senior State government officials, focused on the process of excising civilian areas from cantonments and merging them with municipalities.

The document stated that the study would be reviewed by the excision committee in an upcoming meeting. The Defence Secretary mentioned that the proposal had been prepared by the cantonment board and instructed that it be processed further by the committee. With government orders to complete the excision, the merger of SCB with GHMC is closer to reality. According to guidelines from the Defence Secretary, proprietary rights over assets for civic amenities in the excised area will be transferred to the State government or municipalities at no cost. The assets and liabilities of the cantonment boards will also be transferred to the State municipality.

“This decision is expected to enhance infrastructure and civic amenities in the cantonment area, benefiting residents. The residents express gratitude to Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy and MLA Sri Ganesh for facilitating the merger process,” said Sanki Ravinder Babu, General Secretary of Cantonment Vikas Manch, a NGO operating within the SCB area.

The Secunderabad Cantonment Citizens Welfare Association began advocating for this change in 2014, making representations to various Defence Ministers, including Arun Jaitley, Manohar Parrikar, and Nirmala Sitharaman, and continued efforts with Rajnath Singh. Their persistent lobbying led to the Ministry of Defence forming an expert committee to consider the merger, to which the association contributed detailed presentations. “This decade-long advocacy resulted in the government’s decision to abolish cantonment structures and merge them with local municipal corporations, acknowledging the hardships faced by civilians under old colonial rules,” said Jeetendra Surana, Honorary Secretary of the association.","The Telangana government is progressing towards transferring land from the Secunderabad Cantonment Board to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation, following a study and discussions led by Defence Secretary A.

The Hindu,2024-06-30 00:00:00,The reader-book kinship,"“You think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read. It was books that taught me that the things that tormented me most were the very things that connected me with all the people who were alive, who had ever been alive.”

— James Baldwin, from an interview in the Life magazine, May 24, 1963

Growing up as an introverted child, I always thought there was something “wrong” with me. When those of my age connected well with one another and formed beautiful friendships, I somehow felt left out and unseen. I wondered why I could not strike a rapport with my peers, and this somehow convinced my little self that being an introvert is something to be ashamed of. Everyone kept asking me, “Why can’t you speak more?”, “Why can’t you be more social?” The constant questions plagued my being.

Later, in my teenage years, when Facebook burst into the scene, I stumbled upon a post with a Mark Twain quote: “The worst loneliness is to not be comfortable with yourself.” That changed the entire trajectory of my life, pushing me into a whirlwind of confusion and reflections. I started searching for the book from which this quote came and ended up reading Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, the first novel I devoured, the beginning of a lifelong friendship with books.

I turned to books, books, and more books thereafter. They became my best buddies, go-to guides, and ride-or-die pals, and most important, my definition of home. My hunger for a good friend was satiated by the wonders provided by the many books I have read. From The Catcher in the Rye to The Brothers Karamazov, I have embarked on adventures, forged friendships with characters, and explored realms both familiar and fantastic. I have travelled the world, through centuries, emotions, feelings, and people, and never once did I feel unheard or unseen.

In the vast expanse of life, where companionship is often fleeting, books stand as timeless allies, offering solace, wisdom, and companionship. As Ralph Waldo Emerson said, “I cannot remember the books I’ve read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me.” Books become not just repositories of knowledge, but trusted confidants in our life journey. But, in this era of social media, we seldom find people indulging themselves in the pleasure of reading.

Becoming a book nerd made me realise that in the embrace of a good book, we find kinship, understanding, and a sanctuary away from the cacophony of life. From Pooh and Piglet’s endearing friendship, Fermina Daza’s haughty composure, Basheer-Narayani’s heart-wrenching tale of love to Madhavan’s betrayal and Raskolnikov’s existential dilemma, I have witnessed it all. As C.S. Lewis aptly put it, “We read to know we are not alone.”

Indeed, in the company of books, we find solace, inspiration, and the enduring camaraderie of kindred spirits. To the many books, many authors, many characters, and the many worlds I have experienced, thank you.","The narrator reflects on their journey from feeling misunderstood and isolated as an introverted child to finding solace and companionship in books. Books became their lifelong friends, providing understanding, wisdom, and a sense of connection with characters and stories. Through literature, they discovered kinship and sanctuary, echoing sentiments expressed by authors like Mark Twain and C.S. Lewis on the profound impact of reading.",Human Interest,63,503

Party leader P. Jayarajan remained tight-lipped about Mr. Thomas’ accusations at a district secretariat meeting on Saturday. When approached by mediapersons, Mr. Jayarajan responded that the accusations held more significance for the media than for him.

CPI(M) Kannur district secretary M.V. Jayarajan also refused to address the issue.

Reports indicate that several district secretariat members criticised P. Jayarajan for worsening the situation through his Facebook post, which came after the district secretary had addressed the media.

Mr. Thomas had accused party leaders of liaison with criminal groups, alleging that P. Jayarajan frequently put the party in crisis and used his influence for personal gain, implicating his son Jain P. Raj in illegal activities.

Meanwhile, a statement from the CPI(M) district secretariat said the party condemned ongoing media narratives linking it to criminal groups, labelling the accusations as baseless and misleading. Party leaders refuted claims that State committee member P. Jayarajan and district committee member M. Shajar were aiding such groups.

The district secretariat urged party members and the public to remain vigilant against these false narratives. They said Mr. Thomas’ allegations, shared widely on social media, were unfounded and objectionable.

The CPI(M) reiterated its commitment to mobilising labour and peasant masses, fighting against injustice, and opposing corporate and racist policies. It accused right-wing parties and certain media outlets of attempting to undermine the party’s credibility following recent election losses, urging the public to see through the misinformation campaigns.

Meanwhile, Jain P. Raj, through his lawyer, issued a legal notice to Mr. Thomas, demanding a retraction of the allegations, a public apology, and compensation of ₹50 lakh. Mr. Raj contended that Mr. Thoma falsely linked him to a gold-mining gang, quotation gangs, and illegal businesses.","Manu Thomas, removed from the CPI(M) Kannur district committee, has accused party leaders of criminal associations and misconduct. CPI(M) leaders, including P. Jayarajan and M.V. Jayarajan, have declined to comment on the allegations, dismissing them as media-driven. The party has condemned the accusations, labeling them baseless, and affirmed its commitment to social justice and opposing misinformation campaigns by political rivals and certain media outlets.",International News,64,313

the Olympics. The jury is out on whether it holds her in good stead or has she
been forced to slog it out…

Maybe none of the past matters, because it is the Olympics and because it is PV
Sindhu at the Games. Perhaps, the injuries-healing status of each player in these
last 27 days will ultimately decide if she can sneak in a very difficult third Olympic
medal in women’s singles. But one of Sindhu’s most frustrating statistics of 2024
also reveals that she has literally poured in effort in terms of the highest court
duration amongst all players, throwing in everything in lead-up competitions in
order to sort out her slowly fading elite game.
","Sindhu's Olympic Gamble: High Court Time, High Stakes
PV Sindhu, India's badminton star, has dominated the court pre-Olympics, logging the most playing time among competitors. This intense training raises questions – is it a golden path or a risky gamble?
Past performance might not matter now. The Olympics are here, and Sindhu's a proven champion. But the next month is critical. Her shot at a record-breaking third Olympic medal hinges heavily on injury recovery.
One view sees Sindhu's dedication shining through. She's pouring her heart into pre-tournament matches, aiming to sharpen her elite skills after a slight dip. Maybe this extra court time will translate to Olympic glory.
However, some worry she's overdoing it. The relentless schedule could lead to fatigue or injuries. A more balanced approach might have been wiser.
The verdict is still out. Will Sindhu's gamble pay off? Will her dedication lead to a historic win? Or will the sheer amount of court time backfire in the face of Olympic pressure? The coming weeks will be a tense watch as Sindhu strives for peak performance without burning out.",Sports,181,130
The Hindu,2024-06-30 00:00:00,Supply chain issues delay deliveries of LCA-Mk1A jets,"After some delay, the deliveries of the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA)-Mk1A by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) to the Indian Air Force (IAF) are now expected to begin by end of July with officials stating that the delay is due to supply chain issues, including at HAL and General Electric (GE) in delivering the engines. One jet is now expected to be handed over to IAF by end of July, two officials independently confirmed.

In February 2021, the Defence Ministry had signed a ₹48,000 crore deal with HAL for 83 LCA-Mk1A jets, a more capable fighter jet than the current LCA-MK1 in service. As per contract, three LCA-MK1A planes were to be delivered to the IAF in February 2024 and 16 aircraft per year for subsequent five years. Like the present LCA, these fighter jets will also be powered by the GE F-404 engines.

There have been significant supply chain delays that have delayed the manufacture and deliveries, HAL and defence officials said while expressing confidence that the process would be speeded up once deliveries begin with plans lined up to scale production rate to 18 aircraft per year and eventually to 24 aircraft per year rolling out of three manufacturing lines.

To questions from The Hindu on delay in engine deliveries to HAL, a GE Aerospace spokesperson said: “The aerospace industry continues to experience unprecedented supply chain pressures. GE Aerospace is working with our partner HAL and suppliers to resolve constraints and deliver F404-IN20 engines.”

The LCA is going to constitute a bulk of the IAF in the next few decades. In addition to the 83 Mk1A aircraft on order, the Defence Ministry has given preliminary approval for procurement of another 97 LCA-Mk1A jets. This would eventually make 180 LCA-MK1 jets and 220 jets of the MK1 variant. The combined cost of the 180 Mk1As is an estimated of ₹1.15 lakh crore.

In addition, a larger and more capable LCA-Mk2 is under development that will be powered by the GE F-414 engines. A deal for HAL to license manufacture the engines in India is in advanced stages. As of now, the IAF has committed to procuring around 120 LCA-Mk2 jets.

The IAF has two MIG-21 squadrons, No. 3 squadron ‘Cobras’ and No. 23 squadron ‘Panthers’ remaining in service, one of which will be phased out this year and the other next year, and they will convert to LCA-Mk1A aircraft.

Timely induction of LCAs is crucial to keep the number of fighter squadrons from falling below 30.","Deliveries of the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA)-Mk1A by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) to the Indian Air Force (IAF) are expected to begin by the end of July after delays due to supply chain issues, including delays from General Electric (GE) in delivering engines.

This crackdown can lead to a ban on many such products which do not meet the norms, according to the report.

TIMES OF INDIA,2024-06-30 00:00:00,"Delhi CM in judicial custody: 'Arvind Kejriwal’s custodial interrogation may be needed,' says court","NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Saturday sent CM Arvind Kejriwal to judicial custody till July 12 in a corruption case related to the alleged excise policy scam after his three-day CBI custody ended.
""Considering the fact that the conspiracy alleged against the accused involves a large number of persons who were involved in the formulation and implementation of the excise policy and also the persons who acted as facilitators in the use of ill-gotten money, I find that there exist sufficient grounds for remanding the accused to judicial custody,"" said vacation judge Sunena Sharma of the Rouse Avenue courts.
She said the probe was still in progress and may require custodial interrogation of the accused to confront him with more material likely to be collected. The court allowed the CM to meet his family and lawyers inside the court. It also allowed him to carry medicines and medical devices required for monitoring and controlling his diabetes.
The court passed the order after CBI, represented by special public prosecutor DP Singh, did not seek extension of police custody but requested the court to send the CM to judicial custody for 14 days.

CM's Custodial Interrogation May Be Needed, Says Court
The court, taking note of the available material, said the investigation had revealed that Vijay Nair, media in-charge of AAP and an accused in the case, was a close associate of the Delhi CM. He was contacting various liquor manufacturers and traders ""for demanding undue gratification"" in order to incorporate provisions favourable to them in the policy, said the court.

The name of Kejriwal had surfaced as one of the main conspirators in the criminal conspiracy, the court said.
The agency claimed in its application that Kejriwal did not cooperate with the investigation, gave evasive replies and had failed to give a proper and truthful explanation regarding enhancement of the profit margin for wholesalers from 5% to 12% under the policy without any study or justification.

CBI told the court that Kejriwal could not explain why during the peak of the second wave of Covid pandemic in 2021, cabinet approval for the revised policy was obtained in a hurried manner and within a day when the accused persons of the South Group were camping in Delhi holding meetings with Nair.

He also could not give, CBI claimed, the reasons for Nair holding meetings with various stakeholders in the liquor business in Delhi and of his own meetings with Magunta Sreenivasulu Reddy, accused Arjun Pandey and accused Mootha Gautham. Reddy is a Telugu Desam Party MP in Lok Sabha and his son, Raghav Magunta Reddy, is an accused-turned-approver in the case. Pandey and Gautham are other accused.

The agency expressed apprehension that Kejriwal being the CM may use his influence to tamper with the evidence and may also try to influence potential witnesses who are yet to be examined.

Senior advocate Vikram Chaudhri, who was appearing for the Delhi CM, opposed the CBI plea, requesting the court to ask the agency to place on record the entire material, including the case diary and evidence collected during investigation to satisfy the court regarding the need for judicial custody. The counsel urged the court to reject the CBI plea for judicial custody in absence of such material and give a direction for releasing Kejriwal.


The investigating officer (IO) has pointed out certain incriminatory material for showing that ill-gotten money was used during the Goa assembly elections for making payments towards air tickets and hotel booking during Kejriwal's visits to Goa from June 2021 to February 2022, the court noted.

Further, the court said, the IO has also placed chats of the CM with certain persons involved in the transfer of ill-gotten money to Goa through hawala channels.


Since Kejriwal gave evasive replies regarding his connection with the said persons, his further custodial interrogation may be required to ""unearth the larger conspiracy hatched among the accused persons"" in the matter, the court said, noting the contents of the case diary.
"," Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has been sent to judicial custody until July 12 in connection with the alleged excise policy scam. The court noted the involvement of numerous individuals in the conspiracy and found sufficient grounds for remanding Kejriwal. The CBI did not seek an extension of police custody but requested 14 days of judicial custody, citing ongoing investigations and the need for further interrogation. Kejriwal's potential influence on evidence and witnesses was also a concern. His counsel opposed the plea, asking for evidence to justify the judicial custody, but the court noted incriminating material related to the use of illicit funds in the Goa elections.",Politics,106,666

Jaideep Ahlawat’s post sharing his weight loss journey went viral on social media recently. So, what’s the diet plan and the exercise regimen that led to this amazing transformation? Excerpts from a chat with the actor:
‘I gorged on parathas in the lockdown’
Jaideep got his wakeup call when he approached for a film soon after the lockdown. “I don't gain weight easily, but during lockdown, I gorged on parathas regularly and my weight climbed to around 110 kg,” says the actor, who hails from Haryana and grew up on a diet of ghee, milk, and yogurt.

When I was approached for Paatal Lok, I weighed 85 kg and had to gain weight to play Hathiram Chaudhary. I changed my eating habits, and I was 102 kg when we started shooting,” he adds.
‘Each meal was 100 gm, but had adequate proteins’
Jaideep’s trainer, Prajwal Shetty, would send him customised meals during the training period. “My diet comprised chicken, quinoa, paneer, eggs, and leafy vegetables. This combination helped maintain my metabolic rate. Each meal was 100 grams, but it ensured I got adequate proteins. Avoiding refined sugar completely and limiting carbohydrates gave me a good start,” he says.

Since I grew up in Haryana, I love parathas, roti, chhole and dal with dollops of ghee. I also crave spicy snacks. Though I don't gain weight easily, during the lockdown I kept gorging on parathas and kept putting on, till my weight stood at 110 kg

Losing weight is always more challenging. It was tough to control my cravings at the beginning, but I am passionate about my work and resisted the temptation of cheat meals. My two-hour workout involved a combination of weight training and cardio

TIMES OF INDIA,2024-06-30 00:00:00,Rearing cows has taught me so much about life: Bhavana Ramanna,"As you enter the Ramanna household in Bengaluru, an unusual sight greets you: a cow and her calf. Gowri, the cow, is adorned with brass bells, while her calf Krishna nuzzles by her side. The sound of anklets approaches and the lady of the household, actor and danseuse Bhavana Ramanna arrives to gently lead her cows into their shelter. “Ever since the arrival of Gowri and her little one, my life has taken a whole new hue. They’re living proof that anything is possible when you set your mind to it. Keeping cows at home might seem unthinkable in a bustling city like Bengaluru. But it’s surprisingly manageable, and more importantly, these animals offer a welcome contrast to our tech-driven world. They keep me grounded and connected to a simpler reality,” she says.‘I ALWAYS WANTED TO HAVE AND GROW COWS IN MY HOUSEHOLD’

Growing up in Malnad, cows were a part of Bhavana’s childhood. “I have seen my maternal ajji feeding and looking after our cows. The desire has long been there and a few months ago, a neighbour offered me his cow - Gowri, a black beauty with white spots. We didn’t know she was pregnant then, so imagine our surprise when we got to know about it! Krishna joined our family soon after and our home is now rejuvenated with new life. To hear them moo early in the morning is sheer joy,” says the actor.

‘WE TRANSFORMED THE GARAGE INTO A COW SHED JUST FOR THEM’
Bhavana tells us, “When we initially got Gowri home, the immediate concern was to make a comfortable space for her. Thankfully, our garage is spacious and I decided to transform a part of it into a shelter. A feeding bunk, a linear water space for them to hydrate and clean dry area for resting was created. That’s when I realised the importance of debunking this misconception that we can’t rear cows in a city. If you are blessed with extra space in your home, you can always transform it to accommodate animals, including cows. You just have to plan it well and make the best use of the available space. I have planned it in such a way that the cows are not disturbed even when the cars are taken out.”
‘ECO-FRIENDLY HAS A WHOLE NEW MEANING IN OUR HOUSEHOLD’ Bhavana’s day begins at 6 am and the actor immediately proceeds to the cow shed to spend time with them. “Then I head to the kitchen where all the vegetables and peels are blended into a mix (kalgacchu in local parlance) and I feed it to them. It gives me such joy to do that! I have created a compost pit behind my house and that’s where the cow dung goes along with other organic waste. I have also learnt to milk them and take a lot of pleasure in distributing it to neighbours and friends — it’s fresh, not out of a packet and sent in steel cans. Every product that I make from milk is packed in eco-friendly material and I have eliminated plastic while sending it out to family and friends. I use natural neem oil for the cows to keep insects at bay. Through the day, I’m improvising on various things to ensure we keep the surrounding as organic and natural as possible. We have one life; if not enrich the environment, at least let us safeguard what we have. In an increasingly self-centred world, these gentle creatures have made me revisit an era which was all about bonding between man and nature,” she sums up.
Cow care tips for people living in urban areas ● Find a veterinarian: Locate a qualified veterinarian experienced with large animals before welcoming your cow home. ● Grazing needs: Cows require ample grazing time. If fresh grass isn’t readily available, consider home delivery services. ● Comfortable living: Install soft bedding or rubber mats to provide comfort and prevent injuries from hard floors. ● Safety first: Equip your cow with a GPS tracking device to ensure their safety and give you peace of mind.","Bhavana Ramanna, a prominent actor and danseuse in Bengaluru, has brought a unique touch to her urban home by keeping a cow and her calf, Gowri and Krishna. Growing up in Malnad with cows, Bhavana fulfilled her childhood dream by transforming her garage into a cow shed, creating a comfortable environment for them. Her day starts with feeding the cows blended vegetable peels and managing a compost pit for cow dung and organic waste. Bhavana’s eco-friendly practices include using natural neem oil for insect control and distributing fresh milk in steel cans, eliminating plastic.

The Hitavada,2024-06-30 00:00:00,40% risk allowance for NDRF rescuers: Amit Shah,"THE Union Government has approved a 40 per cent hardship and risk allowance for NDRF rescuers, keeping in mind the tough operations undertaken by them, Union Home Minister Amit Shah announced on Saturday. He said this while welcoming a 35-member expedition team of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) that recently scaled the 21,625-foot-high Mt Manirang in Himachal Pradesh. “The Government has approved a 40 per cent risk and hardship allowance for NDRF personnel only yesterday. This has been a long pending demand... All the 16,000 personnel of the force will benefit from this,” Shah said after welcoming the expedition named ‘Vijay’. Officials said this allowance would be granted over and above salaries. Special forces like the National Security Guard (NSG) and the Special Protection Group (SPG) get a 25 per cent hardship allowance owing to the special charter of their duties.
 
This is the second mountaineering expedition undertaken by the federal contingency force. The team was flagged off on June 1 from here. Mt Manirang is located along the border of Kinnaur and Spiti districts of Himachal Pradesh. Shah said the Government has also decided to make sports a “culture” for the various Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) and special organisations like the NDRF. It has been decided that at least one team from these forces will mandatorily participate in international and national tournaments, he added. “A committee under the chairmanship of the director of the Intelligence Bureau has been constituted and a roadmap has been prepared. We will soon present a new model,” the Minister said. Shah also underlined that forces like the NDRF should ensure that the policy of “zero casualty” during disasters is followed and no lives are lost during calamities.
 
“We have come a long way... The Government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been working on the concept of zero casualties during disasters for the last 10 years,” he said. Shah said his Government has allocated higher funds for capacity building and training of the NDRF and State disaster response forces by allocating Rs 2 lakh crore during 2014-24 as compared to Rs 66,000 crore during 2004-14. He complimented the NDRF team for the successful expedition, saying such exercises will boost the force’s capabilities and morale and it will be able to do better during disasters and accident operations. Shah cautioned the rescuers that they should not rest on their laurels but keep improving. The NDRF was raised in 2006 as a federal contingency and disaster response force and at present, has a strength of more than 18,000 men and women rescuers deployed across the country as part of 16 battalions and 28 RRCs. It undertakes operations to mitigate and combat man-made and natural disasters like earthquakes, floods and train accidents among others.","The Union Government approved a 40% hardship and risk allowance for NDRF rescuers, benefiting all 16,000 personnel, as announced by Union Home Minister Amit Shah.

The Free Press Journal,2024-06-30 00:00:00,We Don’t Believe In One Person’s Face: Sharad Pawar Rejects Shiv Sena UBT's Pitch To Make Uddhav MVA's CM Face Ahead Of Maha Assembly Polls,"Mumbai: In a possible jolt to the Maha Vikas Aghadi alliance, NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar dismissed the Shiv Sena UBT's proposal to name a chief ministerial candidate for the coalition on Saturday. Pawar reportedly stressed that the coalition itself represents a collective face, rejecting the idea of spotlighting one individual. This statement is perceived as a setback to Shiv Sena UBT's efforts to position Uddhav Thackeray as the chief ministerial candidate for the upcoming Maharashtra Assembly Elections.

“Our alliance is our collective face. We don’t believe in one person’s face. Collective leadership is our formula,” Pawar stated according to a Hindustan Times report, addressing Shiv Sena UBT's demand to name the MVA's chief ministerial candidate ahead of the state assembly elections. When questioned further about Uddhav Thackeray's potential candidacy, Pawar reiterated, “I told you, collective leadership will be our face.”

This declaration arrives amidst Shiv Sena UBT's ongoing attempts to elevate their party president as the MVA's chief ministerial face. The issue risks sparking internal conflict within the MVA. Since last Thursday, Shiv Sena UBT MP Sanjay Raut has been advocating for Thackeray’s candidacy, maintaining his position despite Pawar's rejection.

Sanjay Raut's Response On Pawar's Stance

According to the report, responding to Pawar’s stance, Raut acknowledged that what Sharad Pawar said is right. He further affirmed that the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi will achieve a majority (in the state assembly elections). However, he also stated that if Rahul Gandhi was declared the prime ministerial candidate in the Lok Sabha elections, then it could have helped the INDIA alliance in gaining 25 to 30 additional seats nationwide.

""It is our opinion. No government or institution should be without a face. People must know who they are voting for. People voted for Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, and Narendra Modi,” Raut reportedly stated. He also stated that there is no disagreement about the MVA’s leadership face.

When asked if he still supports giving the MVA a chief ministerial candidate, Raut responded, “This is our opinion. However, MVA comprises three parties. Everyone has seen the results of the Lok Sabha elections when all three parties contested together. Hence, we are going to contest the polls unitedly in any case.” He expressed confidence that the MVA will secure at least 175 to 180 seats in the assembly elections.

Last Thursday, Raut championed Thackeray, stating, “Uddhavji was chief minister in the MVA government. People do remember the good work done by him.” He also reminded allies of Thackeray’s leadership during the Lok Sabha elections.

Additionally, Pawar suggested that all three MVA parties should allocate seats to their respective smaller allies from their own quotas. “There are many parties, such as PWP, Left and AAP among others, which helped us during the Lok Sabha elections, and stood against the Modi government.

In its affidavit filed in the Nagpur bench on Bombay high court on Friday, the govt mentioned that a high-powered committee (HPC) headed by Nagpur divisional commissioner has noted the statute is in a prohibited area as per the irrigation department’s March 8, 2018 resolution. The govt had also said it may regularize the statue if a study finds it does not contribute to flooding.

“Those responsible for erecting the statue in a prohibited area should be held accountable for wasting public money,” said Yeshwant Khorgade, an affected resident.

Expressing his frustration, Gajanand Deshpande, a resident of Ambazari Layout said, “The authorities are admitting their mistake in installing the statue in the spillway of Ambazari dam and are now forced to face the consequences.”

The heavy downpour on September 23, 2023, had flooded the Ambazari dam, thereby submerging localities like Purohit Layout, Ambazari Layout, Kasturba Layout, Samata Layout, Yashwant Nagar, Daga Layout, Corporation Colony, Dandige Layout, Shankar Nagar, and other areas situated downstream of Ambazari lake and along Nag River.

Deshpande criticized the decision to commission a study by Central Water and Power Research Station, Pune despite existing reports. “The irrigation department’s resolution of August 2, 2013, and opinions from agencies like VNIT should suffice. The authorities seem to be seeking a favourable report to override previous unfavourable findings.”

Residents also raised concerns about the severe losses incurred due to the flood. “Lives were lost and property worth over ₹300 crore damaged due to floods,” said another Ambazari Layout resident.

Dr Archana Deshpande of Shankar Nagar stated the govt’s stance is a mere eyewash. “Flood hit residents are merely asking for relocation, not demolition, of the statue. “What does regularizing the structure mean? It seems govt doesn’t want to remove it despite our demands for its relocation. The ego of our leaders is putting 25,000 households at risk,” she said.

Residents emphasize that their call for relocating the statue is based on humanitarian grounds, supported by various expert committees. “Experts from irrigation, river, and dam committees have all agreed that the statue is an obstacle that needs to be removed. The govt’s insistence on regularizing it is an irresponsible move that would endanger lives,” said Dr Deshpande adding “Residents are preparing to file a legal rejoinder soon. We are meeting our lawyer""","Residents affected by the flash flood on September 23, 2023, downstream of Ambazari Dam and along the Nag River in Nagpur are demanding accountability for the construction of the Vivekananda Statue in a prohibited area, which they believe contributed to the flooding. The state government admitted the statue was built in a prohibited zone as per the irrigation department’s resolution, but suggested it might be regularized if a study shows it does not cause flooding. Affected residents, including Yeshwant Khorgade and Gajanand Deshpande, criticize the misuse of public funds and the government’s reluctance to relocate the statue despite expert recommendations and significant flood damage. Residents plan to file a legal rejoinder to press for the statue's relocation on humanitarian grounds.",Local News,120,444

 The Orissa Post,2024-06-30 00:00:00,Average Indians spend twice on weddings than education: Report,"The Indian wedding industry size of approximately Rs 10 lakh crore ($130 billion) is second only to food and grocery, with an average Indian spending twice on marriage ceremony than education, a report said.

India sees 80 lakh to 1 crore weddings annually compared to 70-80 lakh in China and 20-25 lakh in the US. “The Indian wedding industry is nearly double the size of the industry in the US ($70 billion), albeit smaller than China ($170 billion),”Weddings are the second largest consumption category in India. “Weddings, if they were a category, would rank as the second largest retail category only behind food and grocery ($681 billion),” it said.

Weddings in India are elaborate and characterised by a range of ceremonies and spending. The industry spurs consumption in categories like jewellery and apparel and indirectly benefits autos and electronics. Despite political efforts to curb them, luxury weddings at exotic locations continue to showcase Indian opulence.

“With 8 million to 10 million weddings held annually, India is the largest wedding destination globally. Estimated at $130 billion in size, according to CAIT, the wedding industry is nearly twice that of the US and is a vital large contributor to key consumption categories,” Jeferries said.

Indian weddings are multi-day and multi-event celebrations, ranging from simple to ultra-lavish. The region, religion and economic background play an important role at several levels.

The Hindu calendar, which follows the lunisolar system, adds to the complexity, as weddings solemnise only on auspicious days in specific months, which changes every year, according to the report.

“An otherwise value-conscious society, Indians love to spend on weddings, which could be disproportionate to their level of income or wealth. And this is irrespective of the economic classes, as the tendency to overspend is seen across.

“The average expenditure on a wedding at $15,000, is a multiple of per-cap or household income. Interestingly, an average Indian couple spends 2x on weddings vs education (pre-primary to graduation), in sharp contrast to countries, such as the US, where the spend is less than half vs education,” it said.

Exotic domestic and international locations, luxurious accommodations, lavish catering with menus curated by Michelin star chefs and performances by professional artists and celebrities, luxury Indian weddings have to be experienced to be understood.

“Given the size and scale, weddings are a key growth driver for several categories in India, such as jewellery, apparel, catering, stay and travel, to name a few. For example, over half of the jewellery industry revenues are led by bridal jewellery while 10 per cent of all apparel spends are driven by weddings and celebrations wear,” it said.

“The wedding industry also indirectly fuels various sectors, such as automobiles, consumer electronics, paints etc. These industries witness a spike in demand around the wedding season, and while difficult to quantify the full impact, industry players meticulously track wedding dates to align marketing strategies and inventory management.”

Jefferies said wedding planning generally begins 6-12 months in advance, and the most elaborate wedding celebrations have seen as many as 50,000 guests.

Bridal lehengas in the luxury segment include heavy intricate work and can even weigh 10 kgs in some cases. Italian Luxury Brand Bvlgari (part of the LVMH Group) launched its first India-only jewellery piece, Mangalsutra, in 2021.

“Decor is the most underestimated cost in an Indian wedding,” it said.

“Most offbeat food requests include chocolate pani puri, waffle dosa and pineapple-flavoured paneer.” brokerage Jefferies said in a report.","The Indian wedding industry, valued at approximately Rs 10 lakh crore ($130 billion), ranks second only to food and grocery in size. With 8 to 10 million weddings annually, India hosts more weddings than any other country globally, surpassing even China and the US. Weddings are a major driver of consumption, particularly in sectors like jewellery, apparel, and hospitality. Despite efforts to curb extravagant spending, luxury weddings at exotic locations remain popular, showcasing Indian opulence. The average Indian spends significantly more on weddings compared to education, highlighting the cultural and economic significance attached to these celebrations.

The Telegraph,2024-06-30 00:00:00,"King, take a bow, T20Is will miss you: Kohli announces retirement after winning World Cup title","India, you will no longer have Virat Kohli standing up for you in T20 Internationals. Are you sad? Or are you relieved?

No longer will a classical genius with the bat pad up for the country in the youngest format of the game. And so no longer will the critics be able to point fingers at his strike rate overlooking the master’s craft.
He wastes balls, he fails to change gears, he is not suited for slam-bang cricket... The complaints were many. But all that will fall silent after the modern-day great announced in Bridgetown on Saturday that he has played the last of his T20Is. But before that, he has gifted India it’s fourth world crown.

All those who thought Kohli’s approach in T20s was outdated should just try and take away 76 runs from India’s total of 176/7 at Kensington Oval in the 2024 T20 World Cup final against South Africa. What would that leave India with? Certainly not the trophy.

Kohli did not dump his game for the sake of the format on Saturday. With India three down for 34, Kohli played like Kohli. He reached his fifty off 48 balls with just four boundaries. No fancy strokes, no reverse scoops, just plain and simple cricket. Once past 50, he struck his first six, when he slapped Kagiso Rabada over long-on. By the time he got out, he had six fours and two sixes in his account and was batting at a strike rate of 128.81. Slow by T20 standards, isn’t it? No. It’s masterful innings, paced to perfection under the circumstances.

At the end of it all, Kohli let flow his emotions. “This was my last T20 World Cup, and this is what we wanted to achieve. One day you feel you can’t get a run, then things happen. God is great, and I got the job done for the team on the day it mattered. My last T20 for India, wanted to make the most of it. Wanted to lift the Cup, wanted to respect the situation rather than force it,” the Man of the Match said.

“It’s time for the next generation to take over, some amazing players will take the team forward and keep the flag waving high.”

Yes, the young guns will take over. But will we have another Kohli? One who will see T20 in the eye and then dare to paint a silken cover drive?

India, your greatest modern-day batsman has just taken off his pads. He is 35. Why couldn’t he continue? Retired hurt, maybe.","Virat Kohli announced his retirement from T20 Internationals after leading India to victory in the 2024 T20 World Cup final.

While some criticized his batting style as outdated for T20 cricket, Kohli silenced them with a crucial knock in the final against South Africa. He anchored the innings with a well-paced 76 runs, helping India reach a defendable total.

Despite his success, Kohli believes it's time for the younger generation to take over the T20 format. The article acknowledges his greatness and questions if India will find another batsman with his unique talent and style.",Sports,95,426
 The Shillong Times,2024-06-30 00:00:00,YSRCP MP Midhun Reddy placed under house arrest in Tirupati,"Tirupati, June 30 :Police placed YSR Congress Party MP from Rajampet, P. Midhun Reddy, under house arrest here on Sunday as he was planning to leave for Punganur in Chittoor district to meet party workers.

The police did not permit Midhun Reddy’s visit to the town as there was apprehension of breach of peace.

Some police officers met the MP at his house and informed him that there was no permission for the visit.

A large number of policemen were deployed outside his house to prevent the gathering of YSRCP workers.

Police have warned that anyone trying to create law and order problems would be dealt with strongly.

The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) workers had recently prevented former minister P. Ramachandra Reddy from visiting Punganur, the headquarters of his Assembly constituency.

Ramachandra Reddy is the father of Midhun Reddy and YSRCP MLA from the Punganur constituency.

The Assembly segment has been witnessing political tension ever since the announcement of poll results on June 4.

Ramchandra Reddy was elected from Punganur for a fourth consecutive term.

TDP’s Challa Ramachandra Reddy, who lost to Ramchandra Reddy, justified the party workers’ action to prevent the former minister from visiting the constituency, saying he had earlier created hurdles for TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu from entering Kuppam constituency.

YSRCP has alleged that the TDP cadres resorted to violence against its workers in the constituency.

Midhun Reddy said he was placed under house arrest as he was going to Punganur to meet party workers who were “subjected” to physical assaults. He said the houses of YSRCP workers were demolished in Punganur.

Last week, Ramachandra Reddy approached the Andhra Pradesh High Court seeking directions to the State government to continue the 5+5 security given to him when he was the minister.

Midhun Reddy too filed a petition seeking the continuation of 4+4 security to him. The High Court directed the State government to file its counter in the two petitions.

",YSR Congress Party MP P. Midhun Reddy was placed under house arrest in Tirupati as he planned to visit Punganur in Chittoor district to meet party workers. Police cited concerns of breach of peace for denying permission. Political tensions have escalated in Punganur following recent election results and alleged incidents of violence.,Crime and Justice,52,324
The Imphal Free Press,2024-06-30 00:00:00,Heavy to very heavy rainfall in NE states for next five days: IMD,"The India Meteorological Department on Saturday forecast heavy to very heavy rainfall over Northwest India including Delhi and the Northeast states during the next four-five days.

IMD also said that the Southwest Monsoon has further advanced into the remaining parts of East Uttar Pradesh and some more parts of West Uttar Pradesh on Saturday.


The northern limit of the monsoon now passes through Jaisalmer, Churu in Rajasthan, Bhiwani, Delhi, Aligarh, Hardoi, Moradabad, Una (Western UP), Pathankot in Punjab and Jammu.



The weather office said conditions are favourable for further advance of southwest Monsoon into some more parts of West Rajasthan, Haryana-Chandigarh & Punjab and remaining parts of West Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu during the next two-three days.


Isolated heavy rainfall is very likely over Delhi, Haryana Chandigarh, Punjab Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and East Rajasthan from June 29 to July 3; West Rajasthan on June 29, July 2 and 3; Chhattisgarh, Gangetic West Bengal, Jharkhand, Odisha on June 29 and 30 and Bihar during June 30-July 2, the weather bulletin states.


The IMD bulletin has forecast widespread light to moderate rainfall accompanied by thunderstorms, and lightning very likely over Northwest, Central and East India during the next five days.


IMD also said that widespread moderate rainfall accompanied by thunderstorms is very likely over Kerala, Karnataka, Konkan and Goa, Gujarat, Madhya Maharashtra; isolated to scattered light to moderate rainfall over Marathwada, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Coastal Andhra Pradesh, Rayalaseema, Telangana, during the next five days.


Widespread light to moderate rainfall accompanied by thunderstorms, lightning and isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall is also likely over Sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam and Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura during next five days, IMD added.



The heavy rainfall is expected to lead to localised flooding of roads, water logging in low-lying areas and closure of underpasses mainly in urban areas.


Occasional reduction in visibility due to heavy rainfall and disruption of traffic in major cities due to water logging in roads is expected to result in increased travel time. There are also possibilities of damage to vulnerable structures.


IMD has suggested that travellers need to check for traffic congestion on their route before leaving for their destination and avoid going to areas that face water logging problems often.

The Southwest Monsoon has progressed further into parts of Uttar Pradesh. Heavy rainfall is expected in various regions, potentially causing local flooding and travel disruptions.",Weather,50,382
the statesman,2024-06-30 00:00:00,Far-Right Surge,"Surge As France heads into the first round of parliamentary elections today, the surge of the far-right National Rally (RN) under Ms Marine Le Pen has captured global attention.surge As France heads into the first round of parliamentary elections today, the surge of the far-right National Rally (RN) under Ms Marine Le Pen has captured global attention. The RN, long a marginal force in French politics, now stands on the brink of a historic breakthrough, potentially securing a majority in the National Assembly. This development is not just a seismic shift for France but a moment of reckoning for Europe and democracies worldwide. The polls indicate that the RN could secure up to 37 per cent of the vote, a rise that reflects deep-seated discontent with the current political order. The centrist bloc, led by President Emmanuel Macron, appears to be losing ground, and the left-wing New Popular Front remains stagnant.

This fragmentation of traditional political forces underscores the growing polarisation in France. Several factors have contributed to this surge. Mr Macron’s presidency, marked by probusiness reforms and a perceived aloofness from the struggles of ordinary citizens, has left many feeling alienated. Issues like the rising cost of living and deteriorating public services have created fertile ground for populist rhetoric. Ms Le Pen has skilfully capitalised on these grievances, softening the party’s image and broadening its appeal beyond its traditional base. The implications of an RN-led government are profound. For France, it would mean a dramatic shift in domestic and foreign policy. Despite efforts to moderate its stance, the RN’s core positions remain deeply Eurosceptic and nationalistic. A government led by the RN could strain France’s relationship with the European Union, posing a significant challenge to the bloc’s cohesion at a time when unity is crucial.

The RN’s fiscal policies also raise concerns about economic stability, as promises of increased public spending clash with the need for fiscal responsibility. Moreover, the potential for political paralysis looms large. Should the RN fall short of an outright majority, France could face a hung Parliament. This scenario would lead to a fraught “cohabitation” between Mr Macron and an emboldened far-right, creating legislative gridlock and undermining effective governance. The stakes are high, and the uncertainty is palpable. The rise of the RN is not an isolated phenomenon. Across Europe and beyond, far-right and populist movements are gaining traction, fuelled by economic anxiety, cultural shifts, and a sense of disenfranchisement. This trend poses a direct challenge to the liberal democratic order established after World War II.It calls into question the effectiveness of mainstream political parties in addressing the needs and concerns of constituents. The outcome of France’s Parliamentary elections will resonate far beyond its borders. It is a pivotal contest that could reshape the country’s future and alter the trajectory of European politics. The rise of the RN reflects broader global trends that challenge the foundations of democracy and demand a renewed commitment to addressing the root causes of populism. The world holds its breath, contemplating the implications of this critical juncture in history","As France faces its parliamentary elections, the far-right National Rally (RN) led by Marine Le Pen has surged, potentially nearing a majority in the National Assembly. This shift marks a significant challenge to traditional political forces, with polls suggesting RN could garner up to 37% of the vote amid discontent over economic issues and perceived political alienation under President Macron's leadership. Le Pen's strategy of broadening the party's appeal beyond its traditional base has resonated amidst concerns about living costs and public services. A potential RN-led government could drastically alter France's domestic and foreign policies, straining EU relations and raising economic stability concerns. The prospect of legislative gridlock in a hung Parliament also looms, posing governance challenges. This election mirrors broader global trends of rising populism, questioning established democratic norms and requiring a renewed approach to political engagement and economic grievances. The outcome holds implications not only for France but for European politics at large, highlighting a critical moment in democratic discourse.",International News,162,509

The Navhind Times,2024-06-30 00:00:00,DGP may be transferred over Assagao house case,"Panaji

With Director General of Police Jaspal Singh likely to be transferred after getting embroiled in a controversy surrounding the partial demolition of a house in Assagao, the state government has now asked the Inspector General of Police Omvir Singh Bishnoi, who is on leave, to resume duty as soon as possible, apparently to take over the additional charge as DGP. 

Bishnoi is currently in a foreign country on a personal visit, sources said.


The government, as reported by this paper, has already briefed the ministry of home affairs about the developments vis-à-vis the Assagao house episode.

The sources said that necessary action is awaited in the matter.


Jaspal Singh has completed two-year tenure as the DGP, and as per senior police officials, his transfer is expected. The DGP has found himself in the dock after the suspended Anjuna police station in-charge Prashal Naik Dessai, in a report submitted to the Chief Secretary, accused the top police officer of pressurising and threatening him for not facilitating the demolition of the Assagao house. 

However, the Chief Secretary after conducting an inquiry into the case suspended Dessai and two police sub-inspectors – Sanket Pokhre and Nitin Naik – for dereliction of duty.

The police said that a fresh summons has been issued to Pooja Sharma, the house owner and  one of the accused in the case, and that she is likely to appear before the crime branch in the next couple of days.

The crime branch probing the house demolition and kidnapping case has registered a separate FIR for forgery and cheating, after one of the vehicles seized from an accused was found to be with a fake vehicle registration number and that the documents were forged.

The Assagao case was transferred to the crime branch on June 26.

Two accused were earlier arrested by the Anjuna police, while six more were held by the crime branch after taking over the case.

A four-member special investigation team was formed by the crime branch to probe the case.

Following this the police added nine more sections to the case under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) which include rioting, intent to outrage modesty and criminal conspiracy.","The state government of Panaji is set to transfer Director General of Police Jaspal Singh following a controversy over the partial demolition of a house in Assagao.

The New Indian Expres,2024-06-30 00:00:00,TISS terminates over 100 employees citing lack of grant: Reports,"The TATA Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) has  dismissed nearly 100 of its staff as the institute has not received funds from the Tata Trust to support the employees, reports said.

More then 50 faculty and 60 non teaching contractual staff were left unemployed. They were with the institute for over a decade.

""It is over the last 10-15 years that we have been receiving the grants for employing additional faculty to teach various courses. That funding was to be renewed. The no-cost extension and renewal of grant doesn't seem to have happened in a timely manner,"" PTI quoted a faculty member as saying on condition of anonymity.

""We were apprised on June 28 about the non-renewal of contracts. We told the TISS administration not to issue the letters (pertaining to non-renewal of contracts) till it hears from the Tata Trust. Let us try to find a solution. But our appeal did not find favour,"" the faculty member said.

Some of the teaching staff members were even part of the interview process which selects candidates for academic sessions for various courses last month, the person said.

""We asked the administration about the status of funding last month and we were told that there was no reason to worry and suddenly notices were issued that contracts have not been renewed due to lack of funds. This is sheer mismanagement on part of the administration which could not foresee what was coming,"" the faculty member said.

Another faculty member said usually contracts get over and teaching members continue to work.

In the past, no notice of termination of contracts was given.

""It seems that this has been done deliberately,"" he said.

Another faculty member said, ""It is a bad scene here. Everyone is in shock.""

A students' body of the institute in a statement on Saturday said the TISS administration must immediately revoke the ""termination"" of the faculty and staff members.

""It is completely a failure of the current leadership of TISS administration in running the institute and apathy of the BJP-led Union government,"" the Progressive Students Forum said.

The ""mass termination"" is set to create ""scarcity"" of the teaching and non-teaching staff, the forum said.

The termination of a 100 such positions will directly impact the future of students who are enrolling in the institute, it might also allow for politically motivated appointments in the near future, it said.

""The BJP-led central government and the current TISS administration are directly responsible for taking away the livelihoods of nearly a hundred employees and putting the future of its students also at risk,"" the forum said.

""The recent blunders made by the Ministry of Education in conducting nationwide entrance examinations only add to the incompetence of the central government,"" it charged.

“Most of us have been working for as many as 10-15 years, including in positions of responsibilities such as centre heads. We are unsure how the institute plans to run the courses after this arbitrary dismissal of such a large number of employees without having an alternative ready,” a faculty member from the Mumbai campus was quoted as saying by The Indian Express report.

Among the teaching staff, 20 of those dismissed were learnt to be from Mumbai campus, 15 from Hyderabad, 14 from Guwahati, and six from Tuljapur. The remaining teaching staff on TISS campuses are permanent faculty members on the University Grants Commission (UGC) payroll, according to The Indian Express.

“The institution has already written to the Tata Education Trust. A committee has been formed to pursue the matter with the Trust. If the grants are received, this can be reverted. But in case of no change in situation, there is no alternative. The institute will have to find alternative ways to run the courses,” said Acting Vice Chancellor Prof Manoj Tiwari.

According to a member of the administration, The Indian Express added, there are plans to propose that the same faculty members work on hourly basis to enable teaching to continue, while also preparing a complete roster of required positions to issue advertisements for regular appointments.

","The Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) dismissed nearly 100 staff members due to the non-renewal of grants from the Tata Trust. This decision affected over 50 faculty and 60 non-teaching staff, many of whom had been with TISS for over a decade. Faculty members criticized the administration for mismanagement and lack of foresight. The Progressive Students Forum condemned the decision, blaming the TISS administration and the BJP-led Union government. Acting Vice Chancellor Prof Manoj Tiwari mentioned efforts to resolve the funding issue and suggested interim measures to continue teaching.",Business and Finance,90,677

The Hindu,2024-06-30 00:00:00,Iran to have run-off between reformist and conservative,"The sole reformist in Iran’s presidential election, Masoud Pezeshkian, will face the conservative Saeed Jalili in a run-off, authorities said on Saturday, following a vote marred by historically low turnout.

Mr. Pezeshkian, 69, secured 42.4% of the vote, while Mr. Jalili, a 58-year-old former nuclear negotiator, came second with 38.6%, according to voting figures announced by Mohsen Eslami, spokesperson for Iran’s elections authority.

Conservative parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf was next with 13.8% of the vote, while the only other candidate, conservative cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi, received less than 1%.

“None of the candidates could garner the absolute majority of the votes,” Mr. Eslami said, adding that those who finished first and second would face each other in a runoff next Friday.

Only slightly more than 40% of the 61 million electorate took part in Friday’s first round — a record low turnout for the Islamic republic.

The electoral authority said more than one million ballots were spoiled.

Out of Iran’s 13 previous presidential elections since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, only one has led to a run-off, which occurred in 2005.

Raisi’s death :- 

The poll had been scheduled to take place in 2025 but was brought forward by the death of conservative President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.

The Guardian Council, which vets candidates, had originally approved six contenders. But a day ahead of the election, two of them — the ultraconservative mayor of Tehran Alireza Zakani and Raisi’s vice president Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh-Hashemi — dropped out. Both candidates asked their supporters to vote for Mr. Jalili in the July 5 run-off.

Friday’s vote took place amid heightened regional tensions over the Gaza war, a dispute with the West over Iran’s nuclear programme and domestic discontent over the state of Iran’s sanctions-hit economy.

Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had called on people to participate in the vote.

Opposition groups, especially in the diaspora, meanwhile called for a boycott, questioning the credibility of elections.","Masoud Pezeshkian, a reformist, will face conservative Saeed Jalili in Iran’s presidential run-off after a historically low turnout.

The Arunachal Times ,2024-06-30 00:00:00,RGU tops IIRF ranking in NE,"RONO HILLS, 29 Jun: Rajiv Gandhi University (RGU) here has been ranked 13th in the list of central universities released by the Indian Institutional Ranking Framework (IIRF), topping in the Northeast region.

Mizoram University secured the 15th position, followed by Tezpur University (Assam), and NEHU, Shillong (Meghalaya) at the 16th and 18th positions among the list of 50 other central varsities in the country.

The IIRF employs a meticulous evaluation process, considering multiple parameters to determine the ranking of an institution. These parameters encompass distinct facets of academic excellence and overall institution performance. The key parameters considered by the IIRF in determining rankings of the institutions includes placement performance, teaching learning resources & pedagogy, research, industry income and integration, placement strategies and support, future orientation, and external perception and international outlook.

RGU Vice-Chancellor Prof Saket Kushwaha congratulated the university fraternity on the ranking by the IIRF. He said that “this is a testimony to the university’s pursuits to excel and we are here to fare better.”

The VC termed it a “watermark achievement, considering its location in the remote border state of Arunachal Pradesh with so many challenges.”

“With this, now RGU will definitely participate in the other international rankings, such as the QS World University Rankings,” he said.

Terming the achievement “a milestone,” RGU Registrar Dr NT Rikam said that “the university community attributes this achievement as an outcome of the persistent efforts of Team RGU, including its students, teachers, academic administrators and non-teaching fraternity for the improvement in teaching and research environment of the university.”

RGU Joint Registrar Dr David Pertin, who is also a member of the university’s Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) divulged that “the inability to admit foreign students joining the varsity, due to RAP and PAP restrictions, is a point of concern.”

Stating that he was not surprised by the ranking, Dr Pertin said that “the university’s patient and persistent toiling is paying off.”

“Good to see that RGU is leaping further to the higher position of 13th as, during last year’s ranking, RGU secured the 16th rank (overall) among the central universities across the nation in the IIRF,” Dr Pertin said.","Rajiv Gandhi University (RGU) in Rono Hills has achieved the 13th rank among central universities in India, as per the Indian Institutional Ranking Framework (IIRF).

The Telegraph,2024-06-30 00:00:00,Ministry of statistics and programme implementation forms panel to find new GDP base year,"The ministry of statistics and programme implementation (MoSPI) has constituted a 26-member Advisory Committee on National Accounts Statistics (ACNAS) to recommend a new base year for GDP data, according to an official notification.

Chaired by Biswanath Goldar, a former professor at the Institute of Economic Growth, ACNAS will also explore the alignment of GDP with key indices such as the wholesale price index (WPI) for inflation, the consumer price index (CPI) for consumer inflation, and the index of industrial production (IIP) for factory growth.

The committee’s tenure is set for five years or until the completion of the next base year, whichever is later.

Its mandate includes reviewing existing databases, advising on new data sources to improve National Accounts estimates, and providing guidance on the methodology for compiling and presenting statistics for economic analysis.

At present, indices such as the IIP, WPI, and National Income are benchmarked to FY12, with the previous base year being FY05. The CPI, a widely used price benchmark, also uses 2012 as its base year.

The base year serves as a reference point for measuring changes in economic variables and comparing the relative performance of indicators over time, with real GDP growth currently calculated based on FY12 prices.

Economists said regular updates to the base year are essential to keep indices aligned to shifts in consumption patterns, sector weights and the inclusion of new sectors.

They recommended such updates at least once every 10 years for accurate GDP calculation. They suggest that FY23 could be a suitable base year for data revision, noting the absence of significant droughts or structural shocks to the economy during that period. Plans are also underway to revamp economic indices.

Experts indicate that price indices are outdated and the product basket composition needs updating. For example, the CPI still includes items such as horsecart fares, VCD players, and dung cakes in its basket of 299 products and services. The RBI relies on the CPI as a key price gauge for monetary policy management.","The MoSPI has formed a 26-member Advisory Committee on National Accounts Statistics (ACNAS) to recommend a new base year for GDP data.

The Orissa Post,2024-06-30 00:00:00,Third leading cause of sudden cardiac death is often asymptomatic; know about it," Aortic aneurysms, which is often asymptomatic, is the third leading cause of sudden cardiac death, said experts Sunday stressing the need for raising awareness on the fatal heart condition.

Aortic Aneurysms are the ballooning of the major blood vessel aorta, which carries blood from the heart to the whole body.It affects approximately 2 to 3 per cent of the population, but the risk increases with certain factors like atherosclerosis (collection of cholesterol in the blood vessels), hypertension, and generic deficiency in certain patients.

“Aortic aneurysms represent a critical yet under-recognised health concern that ranks as the third leading cause of sudden cardiac death, trailing only behind heart attacks and cardiac arrests,” Niranjan Hiremath, a senior consultant cardiovascular and aortic surgeon at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, New Delhi, told IANS.

“When the aorta’s wall weakens, it can dilate to twice or even three times its normal diameter, creating a significant risk of sudden rupture, which can result in immediate death, or lead to aortic dissections, another severe complication,” he added.

In India, awareness about cardiac risks predominantly revolves around heart attacks and cardiac arrests, but the dangers posed by aortic aneurysms have not received comparable attention.

“The lack of awareness is concerning, especially considering that about 75 per cent of aortic aneurysms are asymptomatic and go undetected until they present a sudden, life-threatening emergency. These aneurysms are often discovered incidentally during examinations for other medical conditions,” Niranjan said.

“Most intact aortic aneurysms do not produce symptoms. As they enlarge, symptoms such as abdominal pain and back pain may develop. Untreated, aneurysms tend to become progressively larger and can present with life-threatening complications,” added Shiv Choudhary, Executive Director – Adult Cardiothoracic & Vascular Surgery, Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, Okhla Road, New Delhi.

Aneurysms can develop in any segment of the aorta, but most commonly affects the abdominal aorta. The experts noted that genetic predispositions, trauma or infection, and tobacco can also contribute to the risk of aortic aneurysms.

It “weakens the wall of the aorta and finally leads to aortic rupture. In rupture, massive internal bleeding happens, and, unless treated immediately, shock and death can occur. The other fatal complication is a dissection of the aorta. In dissection, the layers of the wall of the aorta are split. This can result in mal-perfusion to the brain or visceral organs or eventual rupture. In both situations emergency intervention is warranted,” Shiv told IANS.

Open surgery used to be the major form of treatment. Recently, there has been a paradigm shift to minimally invasive techniques of endovascular stent implantation, which is associated with low risk, minimal morbidity, and low mortality, (Surg Cmde) V S Bedi, NM Chairman &amp; Senior Consultant Institute of Vascular &amp; Endovascular Sciences, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital New Delhi, told IANS.

“The aneurysms are required to be treated once the size of the aorta increases to more than 5cm because an increase of more than 6cm can cause sudden leak/rupture which can be fatal,” the doctor added.

The experts also advised strict control of blood pressure for patients with the condition and prohibition of tobacco in any form. Patients with diagnosed aneurysms should avoid intense physical sports and isometric exercise but can walk and indulge in light aerobic exercises.","Aortic aneurysms, affecting 2 to 3 percent of the population, pose a significant risk of sudden cardiac death, ranking as the third leading cause after heart attacks and cardiac arrests. Often asymptomatic, these aneurysms can balloon the aorta's wall, leading to potential rupture or dissection, which are life-threatening emergencies. Awareness about this condition in India remains low compared to other cardiac risks like heart attacks. Most cases are discovered incidentally during medical examinations, highlighting the critical need for early detection. Treatment options have evolved from traditional open surgery to minimally invasive endovascular stent implantation, reducing risks and improving outcomes. Experts emphasize managing risk factors such as hypertension, avoiding tobacco, and adopting appropriate physical activities to mitigate complications associated with aortic aneurysms.",Health and Wellness,121,537

The Orissa Post,2024-06-30 00:00:00,New criminal laws to come into effect July 1,"New Delhi: Three new criminal laws will come into effect across the country from Monday, bringing widespread changes in India’s criminal justice system and ending colonial-era laws.

The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita and the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam will replace the British-era Indian Penal Code, Code of Criminal Procedure and the Indian Evidence Act, respectively.

The new laws will bring in a modern justice system, incorporating provisions such as Zero FIR, online registration of police complaints, summonses through electronic modes such as SMS and mandatory videography of crime scenes for all heinous crimes.

They have tried to address some of the current social realities and crimes and provide a mechanism to effectively deal with these, keeping in view the ideals enshrined in the Constitution, official sources said.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who piloted the laws, said the new laws would give priority to providing justice, unlike the British-era laws that gave primacy to penal action.

“These laws are made by Indians, for Indians and by an Indian Parliament and marks the end of colonial criminal justice laws,” he said.

Shah said the laws were not just about changing the nomenclature but bringing about a complete overhaul.

“Soul, body and spirit” of the new laws is Indian, he said.

Justice is an umbrella term that encompasses both the victim and the culprit, the home minister said and added these new laws would ensure political, economic and social justice with an Indian ethos.

According to the new laws, judgment in criminal cases has to come within 45 days of completion of trial and charges must be framed within 60 days of first hearing.

Statement of rape victims will be recorded by a female police officer in presence of her guardian or relative and medical reports have to come within seven days.

Organised crimes and acts of terrorism have been defined, sedition has been replaced with treason and video recording of all search and seizure have been made mandatory.

A new chapter on crimes against women and children have been added, buying and selling of any child has been made a heinous crime and there is a provision for death sentence or life imprisonment for gang rape of a minor.

The offences against women and children, murder and offences against the State have been given precedence in the new law.

Overlapping sections have been merged and simplified and will consist of only 358 sections against 511 in the Indian Penal Code, the sources said.

For example, definitions scattered from sections 6 to 52 have been brought under one section. Eighteen sections already stand repealed and four relating to weights and measures are covered under the Legal Metrology Act, 2009.

Instances of false promise of marriage, gang rape of minors, mob lynching, chain snatching, etc are reported but the current Indian Penal Code did not have specific provisions for dealing with such incidents.

These have been addressed in the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the sources said.

A new provision has been made for cases such as abandonment of women after making sexual relations on the false promise of marriage.

The three laws were based on justice, transparency and fairness, the sources said.

Under the new laws, a person can now report incidents by electronic communication, without the need to physically visit a police station. This allows for easier and quicker reporting, facilitating prompt action by the police.

With the introduction of Zero FIR, a person can file a First Information Report (FIR) at any police station, regardless of jurisdiction.

This eliminates delays in initiating legal proceedings and ensures immediate reporting of the offence.

An interesting addition of the law is that in the event of an arrest, the individual has the right to inform a person of his choice about his or her situation.

This will ensure immediate support and assistance to the arrested individual.

Besides, arrest details will now be prominently displayed within police stations and district headquarters, allowing families and friends of the arrested person easy access to important information.

To strengthen cases and investigations, it has become mandatory for forensic experts to visit crime scenes for serious offences and collect evidence.

Under the new laws, victims of crime against women are entitled to regular updates on the progress of their case within 90 days.

This provision keeps victims informed and involved in the legal process, enhancing transparency and trust.

The new laws guarantee free first-aid or medical treatment to victims of crimes against women and children at all hospitals.

This provision ensures immediate access to essential medical care, prioritising the wellbeing and recovery of victims during challenging times.

Summonses can now be served electronically, expediting legal processes, reducing paperwork and ensuring efficient communication among all parties involved.

For certain offences against woman, statements of the victim are to be recorded, as far as practicable, by a woman magistrate and, in her absence, by a male magistrate in the presence of a woman to ensure sensitivity and fairness, creating a supportive environment for victims.

Both the accused and the victim are entitled to receive copies of the FIR, police report, charge sheet, statements, confessions, and other documents within 14 days.

Courts grant a maximum of two adjournments to avoid unnecessary delays in case hearings, ensuring timely justice delivery.

The new laws mandate all state governments to implement witness protection schemes to ensure the safety and cooperation of witnesses, enhancing the credibility and effectiveness of legal proceedings.

The definition of “gender” now includes transgender individuals, promoting inclusivity and equality.

By conducting all legal proceedings electronically, the new laws offer convenience to victims, witnesses and accused, thereby streamlining and expediting the entire legal process.

To provide more protection to the victim and enforce transparency in investigation related to an offence of rape, the statement of the victim shall be recorded through audio-video means.

Women, persons below 15 years, persons above 60 years and those with disabilities or acute illnesses are exempt from attending police stations and can receive police assistance at their place of residence.

","Three new criminal laws are set to replace colonial-era statutes in India starting Monday, aiming to modernize the justice system. The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam will update criminal procedure, evidence laws, and the penal code, introducing provisions like Zero FIR, online complaint registration, and mandatory crime scene videography.

It was sweet, sweet redemption for Kohli, who came good with the bat when it mattered. 

His 59-ball 76 may not have set the pulse racing, but it immensely helped the team’s cause.


India found two more heroes in Jasprit Bumrah and Suryakumar Yadav. With a miserly 18th over, Bumrah tightened the screws on South Africa. 

Bumrah conceded two runs and picked up a wicket in those six balls, which put the Proteas in a corner.

The final nail in the coffin was driven by Suryakumar, who pulled off a brilliant catch to dismiss David Miller in the last over. A juggling effort from Suryakumar at long-off sent the last recognised batter back. South Africa was knocked out cold.


Challenging total
After winning the toss, India made a challenging 176 for seven. 

There was concern among the Indian fans at the Kensington Oval when the side slipped to 34 for three. India was forced to rebuild. Axar Patel and Kohli calmed nerves with sensible batting. 

Axar knew his role well, having performed this task against Pakistan earlier in the tournament.

It's not what we did today but what we did for past 3-4 years: Rohit Sharma after win over South Africa

A 72-run fourth-wicket partnership was exactly what India needed to stay afloat. 

There could have been more, if not for a lazy piece of running from Axar. Though halfway down the track, Axar had time to turn back and make the crease.

Caught short
Axar, however, stopped in his track for a moment. Wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock took full advantage, throwing down the stumps at the bowler’s end to catch Axar short. 

Kohli’s desire to make it count was evident when he did not acknowledge cheers for his fifty. 

Using good technique and shots along the ground, Kohli stuck in for the long haul.

His effort paid rich dividend in the end. The nation rejoiced alongside Kohli and his mates.

The eviction drive was carried out as the vendors had not complied with the notice issued to them to shift to safer areas.

“Regular announcements were also made to inform them of the probable risks of residing in such vulnerable locations and to move to safer locations. Despite these warnings, the vendors were still continuing to run their outlets, and hence it was necessary to carry out the eviction to prevent potential accidents and ensure everyone’s safety,” DC Shweta Nagarkoti Mehta said.

Also, multiple complaints were being received by the DA regarding encroachment over the drains in the 6 Kilo area.

The occupants on the other side of the road, who were not sitting over the drains, were not evicted, the DC said.

“While this may cause some inconvenience, it is a necessary step to ensure everyone’s safety,” she said.

Mehta said that, with the onset of the monsoon season, the administration has been working diligently to implement measures to ensure the safety and wellbeing of all residents.

“The monsoon season brings an increased risk of landslides, flooding, and other weather-related hazards, posing significant dangers to both vendors and the public,” she said.

The DC informed that areas where encroachment has taken place over drains and can pose danger during heavy rains are also being identified.

She has advised all such illegal occupants to vacate and move to safer locations.

Mehta further informed that the eviction drive will continue in all vulnerable and disaster-prone areas of the capital. (DIPRO)","In Itanagar, the district administration evicted street vendors from the 6 Kilo area along NH 415 on Saturday, demolishing their temporary sheds constructed over drains.

The Pioneer,2024-06-30 00:00:00,Court sends Kejriwal to 14 days’ judicial custody,"A Rouse Avenue court on Saturday sent AAP convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to 14 days judicial custody in a corruption case related to the alleged excise scam.

He was produced before Special Judge Sunena Sharma of the Rouse Avenue court by the CBI after the end of his three-day custodial interrogation, following which the agency sought 14-day judicial custody while claiming that he was an influential politician who could tamper with evidence and influence witnesses if he did not remain in custody.  The CBI did not seek an extension of its custody of Kejriwal and asked that he be sent to judicial custody.

Allowing the plea, Special Judge Sunena Sharma said that Kejriwal be produced in the court on July 12.  Following a request by Kejriwal, the court has also permitted him to appear through video conferencing in the next hearing instead of having the authorities produce him physically.

""Considering the fact that the conspiracy alleged against the accused (Kejriwal) involves a large number of persons who were involved in the formulation and implementation of excise policy and also the persons who acted as facilitators in the use of ill-gotten money, I find that there exist sufficient grounds for remanding the accused to judicial custody',"" Special Judge Sunena Sharma said.

""...The investigation is still in progress and may require custodial interrogation of the accused to confront him with more material likely to be collected during the course of the investigation.

Accordingly, accused Arvind Kejriwal is remanded to judicial custody till July 12,"" the judge added. 

Noting the evidence before it, the court said that the investigation revealed that accused Vijay Nair, a close associate of Kejriwal, was the media-in-charge of the Aam Admi Party and he had contacted various liquor manufacturers and traders for demanding undue gratification for incorporation of provisions favourable to them in the excise policy for 2021-22.

It also noted that Kejriwal's name surfaced as one of the ""main conspirators of the criminal conspiracy"" for various offences under provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act and Indian Penal Code.  ""Four chargesheets in the case have already been filed against 17 accused persons including the persons of South group,"" the court noted.

It said that the investigating officer (IO) had pointed out in the case diary that Kejriwal was not cooperative during his custodial interrogation, nor was he truthful in disclosing facts on many material aspects. 

""The IO has pointed out certain incriminatory material collected during the investigation for showing that the ill-gotten money was used during the Goa assembly election for making payments towards the expenses of air tickets and hotel booking during the visits of the accused to Goa from June 2021 to February 2022,"" the court said.  It said that the IO also showed some incriminatory material showing Kejriwal's chats with certain persons ""involved in the transfer of ill-gotten money to Goa through hawala"".

In its remand application, the CBI said during the custodial interrogation, Kejriwal did not cooperate with the investigation and deliberately gave evasive replies contrary to the evidence on record. ""On being confronted with the evidence, he did not give a proper and truthful explanation regarding the enhancement of the profit margin for wholesalers from 5% to 12% under the new excise policy of Delhi 2021-22, without any study or justification,"" it said.

""He also could not explain as to why during the peak of second wave of Covid, the cabinet approval for revised excise policy was obtained through circulation in a hurried manner within one day, when the accused persons of the South Group were camping in Delhi and holding meetings with his close associate Vijay Nair,"" it added.

The application said Kejriwal evaded the questions regarding the meetings of his associate Vijay Nair with various stakeholders of the liquor business in Delhi and he was unable to give proper explanation about his meeting with Magunta Sreenivasulu Reddy, accused Arjun Pandey and accused Mootha Gautham.
","A Rouse Avenue court has remanded Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to 14 days of judicial custody in a corruption case linked to an alleged excise scam. After a three-day interrogation, the CBI argued for his custody, citing concerns he could tamper with evidence or influence witnesses. Special Judge Sunena Sharma noted Kejriwal's involvement in a conspiracy involving multiple individuals related to the excise policy and found grounds for his remand due to ongoing investigations. The CBI highlighted Kejriwal's non-cooperation during questioning and pointed to evidence of his connections to illicit financial activities related to the Goa assembly elections.

The Pioneer,2024-06-30 00:00:00,IGIA roof collapse: Victim's family to decide on legal action after cremation,"The son of the 45-year-old cab driver who died after a portion of a canopy at the Delhi airport collapsed amid heavy rains said the family will take a decision on filing a case in the matter after his father's cremation.

 The police handed over the body of the cab driver, Ramesh Kumar, to his family after postmortem at the Safdarjung Hospital on Saturday, a day after the incident, officials said.

 ""At around 12.30 pm, we received the body of my father after postmortem and we will return to our house. We will go for cremation at around 3.30 pm near our house,"" Ramesh's 25-year-old son Ravinder said.

 He said after his father's cremation, all the family members will discuss and decide whether they would file a case against those responsible for his father's death.

 Ramesh was waiting for some passengers at the IGI T-1 Friday early morning when a portion of a canopy covering the departure area collapsed on parked cars amid three hours of heavy rain in the national capital. Six people were also injured in the incident, prompting authorities to suspend flight departures.

 On Friday, Ravinder had said  that he was sleeping when he got a call from the police station asking him to come to the Delhi airport's Terminal 1 immediately.

 Upset over the compensation amount offered by the government, Ravinder had said that he had recently purchased the vehicle for Rs 5 lakh and had to make a down payment of Rs 1 lakh.

 Civil Aviation Minister K Rammohan Naidu, who visited the airport and took stock of the situation at T1, announced a compensation of Rs 20 lakh for the family.","Ramesh Kumar, a 45-year-old cab driver, tragically died when a portion of a canopy at Delhi’s IGI Airport Terminal 1 collapsed during heavy rain on Friday.

TIMES OF INDIA,2024-06-30 00:00:00,‘BJP wastes 6 mths of tenure by reviewing Cong schemes’,"Jaipur: State Congress president Govind Singh Dotasra criticised the Bhajan Lal Sharma govt for wasting initial six months of its tenure by reviewing the welfare schemes implemented by the Congress govt.

Speaking to the media at the party office on Saturday, Dotasra asserted that BJP ministers are busy issuing statements regarding the closure, curtailment, or investigation of these schemes and the abolition of new districts established by the Congress govt.

“The BJP govt has not undertaken any initiatives in the public interest during the past six months. Their actions have been confined to internal conflicts, resignation announcements, and frequent visits to the Delhi darbar,” said Dotasra.

Accusing the BJP govt of taking away credit for the accomplishments of the previous Congress govt, he alleged that they are deceiving the people by portraying the previous govt’s work as their own through advertisements.

“The pension amount recently disbursed by the CM in Jhunjhunu was predicated on a law enacted by the previous Congress govt, which stipulated a minimum pension of Rs 1,000 with a 15% annual increment. Legally, the govt is obligated to increase the pension amount annually, which was a norm established by the previous Congress govt, but the CM is claiming credit as if it were an initiative of his govt,” said Dotasra.

He highlighted that the BJP govt has not issued any recruitment notifications for the youth but is endeavouring to take credit for the recruitments and exams conducted by the previous Congress govt. He emphasised that providing employment to youth is not a priority for the current government, as they have remained silent on the issue since assuming power.

Deccan Chronicle,2024-06-30 00:00:00,"DC Edit | Team India triumph in T20 WC, cricket the real  ","There was a flood of tears after Team India held off South Africa in a pulsating final of fluctuating fortunes. An 11-year wait for a significant ICC event cup victory had built up the emotions in a cricket-crazy country so much that grown sportsmen wept tears of joy on a sunny afternoon in Barbados in the Caribbean. As South Africa went down gallantly in pursuit of a gettable target, tears of sorrow were shed too. But Team India was the superior combination amongst the two unbeaten sides that reached the summit of a representative T20 World Cup of 20 teams in which freshers like the USA and Afghanistan performed way beyond expectations. There were match-turning moments in the final that swung the game the way of the favourites India after they had recovered from early losses on a good pitch as Virat Kohli expertly anchored the innings, relying more on temperament than ball-striking talent, even as a vastly underrated all-rounder in Axar Patel steadied the boat. A momentum-snapping injury time out as India wicket-keeper Rishabh Pant was tended to saw Heinrich Klaasen, who seemed determined to take South Africa storming to the target in style, get out off the bowling of Hardik Pandya. An extraordinarily composed catch on the boundary rope by Suryakumar Yadav off Pandya again sending David Miller back to the pavilion and some smart seam bowling by man of the series Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh saw India prevail by seven runs in a thriller. Team India had been competitive in varying conditions, from the bowler-friendly drop-in pitches of New York and Miami, USA, to the more batting-conducive surfaces in the West Indies, its batters putting up defendable totals, no matter whether they were high or low and the fielders generally performing way beyond their known lack of alacrity. So good was the bowling, particularly by the spinners early on and then the pacers in the knockouts, led by the inestimably good fast bowler “Boom Boom Bumrah”, that India became the first to win a T20 World Cup unbeaten. Having ridden out stormy times as well as highs in their long careers, skipper Rohit Sharma and former captain Virat Kohli announced their retirement from T20 internationals, judging this victorious campaign to be the best time to call it quits. T20 is more of a team game than the two other formats that offer even more scope for individual performances. To shine in it, Team India had to reinvent themselves somewhat and a kindly skipper in Rohit who also showed the way with selflessly aggressive batting helped with his inclusive and calm approach and coach Rahul Dravid with his sheer persistence. The stars and the bits-and-pieces men shone to get Team India its fourth World Cup, two apiece in T20 and ODI formats.The event may have been tailored to Indian primetime TV viewership by a pliant ICC, beholden to Indian cricket for most of its riches. But Team India repaid the faith of a billion fans with a performance across trials and tribulation to induce national pride even if there should be no place for jingoism in sport. Former champions West Indies, Australia and England struggled to be consistent and were often caught short in T20 cricket that is tailormade for David versus Goliath upsets, at which Afghanistan sparkled with wins over New Zealand, Australia and Bangladesh before a semi-final against South Africa proved a bridge too far. The T20 game, better designed to give cricket a truly global reach, was a good advertisement for its attractions, even if glitches were galore in its organisation by a pedestrian ICC. The cricket behemoth India may have the most to celebrate but there was plenty for the others too, which means the game of cricket won as much as India’s always-optimistic fans.
","Team India clinched their long-awaited ICC T20 World Cup victory after an intense final against South Africa, which brought forth tears of joy and sorrow alike. Virat Kohli's resilient innings and Axar Patel's stabilizing performance were pivotal as India overcame early setbacks. Crucial moments like Rishabh Pant's injury timeout and Suryakumar Yadav's spectacular catch turned the game in India's favor. The team's adaptability across different pitch conditions, bolstered by outstanding bowling from Jasprit Bumrah and others, secured their unbeaten run throughout the tournament. Captains Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli announced their retirement from T20 internationals following this triumph, underscoring the team's collective strength over individual prowess in T20 cricket. Despite controversies and challenges, including organizational issues by the ICC, the tournament showcased cricket's global appeal and India's dominance, while also highlighting surprises from teams like Afghanistan.

THE STATESMAN,2024-06-30 00:00:00,Delhi govt announces Rs 10-lakh ex gratia for rain-related deaths on June 28,"The Delhi Government on Sunday announced a compensation of Rs 10 lakh to the next of kin of those who lost their lives following the unprecedented rain in the city on June 28.

Taking to social media, Delhi Cabinet Minister Atishi said: “Several deaths have been reported on 28th June, after extreme rainfall of 228 mm in 24 hours.”


“The families of all those who lost their lives will be given a compensation of ₹10 lakhs,” the minister added.




Atishi said directions have been given to the concerned department and officials to ensure that this compensation reaches the grieving families at the earliest.


In her letter to the ACS Revenue, Atishi directed to identify those who lost their lives with the help of area hospitals and the Delhi Police and immediately provide them with compensation on behalf of the GNCTD.

Meanwhile, the toll of rain-related deaths rose to ten, including the demise of a cab driver, at the airport, after a portion of the canopy of Terminal T1 collapsed.

While one person died of electrocution in the Rohini area, two others drowned in the Usmanpur area and another at Shalimar Bagh.

Bodies of three labourers, who were trapped in a pit of an under-construction building in the Vasant Vihar area on Friday, were recovered on Saturday by a joint team of the NDRF, SDRF, and DFS.

Meanwhile, in a separate incident, two boys aged nine years drowned near Siraspur underpass. They were rescued by the Delhi Fire Services (DFS) team and were brought to Babu Jagjivan Ram Hospital where they were declared dead.

The New Indian Express,2024-06-30 00:00:00,"In Rajasthan, minister’s ‘DNA test to check if Hindu’ remark met with a protest","Tribal leader and Banswara MP Rajkumar Roat on Saturday led a protest against Rajasthan Education Minister Madan Dilawar’s suggestion of a DNA test to verify if Roat was indeed a Hindu.

Holding their blood samples in their hands, Roat and the supporters of his Bharat Adivasi Party started marching towards Dilawar’s residence to mark a protest but were stopped by the police, after which they protested at the Amar jawan Jyoti.



“There is immense anger against Madan Dilawar’s comments. Until he resigns and apologises to the community, we will not let it go,” Roat said, adding that the minister has committed a grave mistake and the party will raise the issue in the state Assembly as well as before Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Parliament.

The controversy broke out on June 21 after Dilawar, while responding to a question on the tribal leader’s earlier remarks that he and his supporters were not Hindu, said: “Hain ke nahi hain, woh toh unke poorwajon se pooch lenge … aur Hindu nahi hain woh toh phir unke DNA ki jaanch kara lenge, unke baap ki aulad hain ke nahi woh (We will ask his ancestors whether he is a Hindu or not … and if (he says) he is not a Hindu, then we’ll get his DNA tested whether he is his father’s son or not).”

At Saturday’s protest, where he was joined by party MLA from Dungarpur Umesh Meena as well as Congress MLAs Ramkesh Meena (Gangapur) and Ghanshyam (Todabhim), Roat reiterated he does not fall under the Hindu varna system.

“Our country’s Constitution gives everyone the freedom to follow any religion or not…We do not oppose any religion but we indeed say that we do not come under any religion. Why should anyone have a problem? The BJP leaders should end the politics of religion and stop misleading the tribals,” he said. He added that the community is sending their hair, nails, etc. to Dilawar by post so that he can get their DNA tested.

Reacting to the protest, Dilawar repeated his earlier stance. “The tribals are a part of our community. They were Hindus, are Hindus, and will remain Hindus,” he said.

Other state BJP leaders, however, avoided commenting on the row, which comes as the bypolls for five Assembly seats are set to be held soon.

The BAP was formed out of the Bharatiya Tribal Party in September 2023. Like BTP, it advocates the creation of a ‘Bhil Pradesh’.

The community has consolidated under Roat and the BAP in some pockets. Against BTP’s two MLAs in the previous Assembly, the BAP now has three MLAs and one MP, with Roat defeating Congress rebel and BJP candidate Mahendra Jeet Singh Malviya in the Banswara Lok Sabha seat.

With Roat vacating his Chorasi Assembly seat to sit in Parliament, BAP’s figure may only go up.","Tribal leader Rajkumar Roat and his supporters from the Bharat Adivasi Party protested against Rajasthan Education Minister Madan Dilawar's suggestion of a DNA test to verify Roat's Hindu identity. The protesters marched towards Dilawar's residence but were halted by the police. Roat demanded an apology from the minister and vowed to raise the issue in the state Assembly and before Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The controversy arose after Dilawar's remarks on June 21, stating that Roat's ancestry would confirm his Hindu status, and if not, a DNA test would be conducted. Roat reiterated that he does not identify with the Hindu varna system and called for an end to the politics of religion. Dilawar maintained his stance that the tribal community is part of Hinduism. The Bharatiya Tribal Party, out of which the Bharat Adivasi Party was formed in 2023, advocates for the creation of a 'Bhil Pradesh'. With three MLAs and one MP, the BAP has gained support in tribal pockets.",Politics,162,474
