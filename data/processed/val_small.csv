Indian Express,2/20/0627,"‘Socialist’, ‘secular’ in Preamble: Shivraj, MoS Singh back Hosabale, Opposition slams remark","A day after RSS Sarkaryavaha Dattatreya Hosabale called for a discussion on whether the words ‘socialist’ and ‘secular’, inserted in the Preamble of the Constitution during the Emergency, should remain there, Union Ministers Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Dr Jitendra Singh threw their weight behind the idea even as leaders of the Congress and other Opposition parties criticised Hosabale’s remark.
There was no comment from the BJP on the RSS leader’s suggestion. Sudhanshu Trivedi, the party’s national spokesperson, attacked the Congress for being “behind every act of tampering with the Constitution and its spirit” over the last seven decades, and said it should apologise for the Emergency.
The LJP, which is part of the ruling alliance, was the only NDA partner to respond to Hosabale’s remark. “If this issue is brought before the alliance, we will oppose it. We are protectors of socialism and secularism,” LJP national vice president A K Bajpayi said.
Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s office shared a video of the minister addressing a press conference Friday in Varanasi where he said, “Sarva Dharma Sambhav Bharatiya sanskriti ka mool hai. Dharm nirpeksh hamari sanskriti ka mool nahin hai. Isliye ispar zaroor vichaar hona chahiye ki aapaatkaal mein jis dharm nirpeksh shabd ko joda gaya usko hataya jaaye.”
(“The core of Indian culture is Sarva Dharma Sambhav (equal respect for all religions) and not dharm nirpeksh (secular). Therefore, there must be a discussion on the removal of the word dharm nirpeksh that was added during the Emergency.”)
On socialism, Chouhan said that to believe everyone else to be like oneself is a core Indian thought. That this world is a family (Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam) is the core thought of India, he said.
“There is no need for socialism here. We have said for long that all should be treated alike. So, the word socialism is also not needed, and the country should certainly think about this,” he said.
In Jammu, Minister of State Jitendra Singh said he did not think there was “any second thought” on Hosabale’s remark. “Hosabale ji has stated that the words ‘secular’ and ‘socialist’ were added to our Preamble after the 42nd amendment as these were not given by Babasaheb Ambedkar,’’ he said.
Pointing out that Dr B R Ambedkar crafted “one of the best Constitutions of the world’’, Singh said “if it was not his thinking, then with what thought someone added these words”.
Asked whether the BJP endorsed the demand for the removal of the words ‘secular’ and ‘socialist’, Singh said, “Who doesn’t want to? Every right-thinking citizen will endorse it because everyone knows they are not part of the original Constitution document, which Dr Ambedkar and the rest of the committee wrote.”
“It is not a question of BJP vs non-BJP,’’ he said, adding “it is the question of preserving the democratic values and the constitutional values’’.
He said the Emergency was not a sudden aberration but rather the cumulative result of the Congress ideological foundation, and ","A day after RSS Sarkaryavaha Dattatreya Hosabale called for a discussion on whether the words ‘socialist’ and ‘secular’, inserted in the Preamble of the Constitution during the Emergency, should remain there, Union Ministers Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Dr Jitendra Singh threw their weight behind the idea even as leaders of the Congress and other Opposition parties criticised Hosabale’s remark.

He said the Emergency was not a sudden aberration but rather the cumulative result of the Congress ideological foundation, and accused the party of being rooted in nepotism, authoritarianism and opportunism, always placing its own interests above that of the country. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said: “Invoking the Emergency to discredit these principles is a deceitful move, especially when the RSS colluded with the Indira Gandhi government during that time for its own survival… To use that period now to undermine the Constitution reflects sheer hypocrisy and political opportunism.” BJP’s Trivedi was quoted by news agency PTI saying, “The BJP has been raising the issue of flagrant violations of people’s fundamental rights and atrocities committed by the Congress government during the Emergency, and has demanded an apology from the Congress. But the party is not ready to apologise and is instead diverting the issue.” “It is the Congress which is behind every act of tampering with the Constitution and its spirit in the last over 70 years.",Politics
Arunachal Times,2023-01-23 00:00:00,PM Modi has connected every Indian with G20: Adityanath at BJP state meet,"Lucknow, 22 Jan: Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday exhorted the BJP workers saying the resonance of the slogan ‘Modi ha to mumkin hai’ is not limited to India anymore but has spread globally, a proof of that is India’s presidency of G20 group.
G20, an intergovernmental group, has 19 members, besides the European Union, and is chaired by each member nation for a year, rotationally. Brazil is slated to chair the group in 2023.
“Wherever there is crisis in the world, everyone looks towards Prime Minister Narendra Modi with hope. The slogan that was raised in 2019 – ‘Modi hai to mumkin hai’ – today has not only become India’s slogan, it has become a global mantra and India getting the presidency of G-20 is an example of that,” Aditynath said.
“Modi ji has done the work of connecting every Indian with the G20. There are 11 conferences related to G20 which will be held in Agra, Lucknow, Varanasi, and Gautambuddha Nagar,” he said, addressing the daylong inaugural session of BJP’s state executive meeting at Indira Gandhi Pratishthan.
Referring to the Global Investors Summit to take place on February 10 and 12, he said UP is emerging as a destination for new investments and every BJP worker needs to come forward. “We all move forward with the spirit of victory. Many possibilities will come to us.”
Criticising the past UP governments, he said, “Yesterday you must have seen Mauni Amavasya’s bath in Prayagraj. More than 2 crore devotees had gone there. If the previous governments tried to understand this potential, then we would not have had to knock on others’ doors.”
Seven months into his second government, Adityanath said that for the first time under the leadership and guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a government was re-formed in UP with a two-thirds majority after completing five years in office.
“This was the result of the zeal and enthusiasm of the workers of the world’s largest political party like BJP,” he said.
The Chief Minister said that the party came to power in Azamgarh and Rampur Lok Sabha constituencies where by-elections were held, only because of Modi, who destroyed forecasts of all the analysts.
“762 municipal bodies are up for elections. And as soon as the report of the OBC commission comes, election will be announced, and with it BJP’s victory flag should be seen waving like it did in 2014, 2017, 2019, 2022 and in the municipal elections,” he said.
BJP state president Bhupendra Singh Choudhary, who also addressed the meeting earlier, set the party a target of winning all 80 seats in the state in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.
More than 700 party workers including Deputy Chief Ministers Keshav Prasad Maurya and Brajesh Pathak, Union Ministers General VK Singh, Sanjeev Balyan, Kaushal Kishore, Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, and Bhanu Pratap Verma attended the meeting. (PTI)","
Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, speaking at BJP’s state executive meeting in Lucknow, stated that the slogan ""Modi hai to mumkin hai"" has gained global recognition, evidenced by India’s G20 presidency. He praised PM Modi’s leadership and urged BJP workers to contribute to the success of the upcoming Global Investors Summit and upcoming municipal elections. Adityanath also criticised past UP governments for not tapping into the state’s potential and highlighted BJP’s electoral victories as a sign of growing support. BJP state president Bhupendra Singh Choudhary set a goal to win all 80 Lok Sabha seats in UP in 2024.

Indian Express,2/20/0627,AAP divided Delhi into two verticals… ignored those who pay taxes: CM Rekha Gupta at Express Adda,"Accusing the previous AAP government of dividing Delhi into “two verticals” by ignoring tax-payers, Chief Minister Rekha Gupta said Thursday that people are now “running towards Gurgaon, Faridabad, Noida” in the National Capital Region (NCR) instead of setting up businesses in the city.
Speaking at the Express Adda Thursday, Gupta also said the BJP’s poll promise of distributing Rs 2,500 each per month to women from economically weaker sections would be implemented soon, saying her government did not want to “rush into things”. Asked about the ongoing demolition drives in slum clusters, Gupta said it was time people started “calling out what is wrong”, such as encroachment.

“The previous government and the party divided Delhi into two verticals — one includes those who pay taxes, which help run the city. They never paid attention to them… from traders to industry, there is nothing in Delhi. There are no jobs, no work… They are all running towards Gurgaon, Faridabad, Noida,” the Chief Minister said.

“Then there are those people who they lured by giving 200 units of electricity free to get votes. They used this formula in a way that left people to their own devices and there was no accountability… But gradually, people understood that this will not help the city grow… we need industry and infrastructure,” she said.
On the ongoing demolition drives, Gupta said wrong practices should be flagged. “In this city, people have stopped calling out what is wrong. Today, we are in a situation where it has become wrong to say that you cannot build houses on railway tracks; following court orders is considered wrong,” she said.
“Despite giving slum dwellers houses worth Rs 35 lakh, if they don’t move and you remove the encroachment, what can you say? There are 675 slum clusters and lakhs of houses in Delhi that are eligible for rehabilitation based on set rules. Neither the Congress nor AAP gave houses to anyone, they only encouraged them to come in and settle… If the BJP govt is demolishing slums, it is also providing new houses to the people even as it improves the city’s infrastructure,” she said.

Responding to a question on being a part of the anti-corruption movement in 2011-12, which gave rise to AAP, Gupta said, “It was a moment when people of Delhi thought a change was going to come. All of them wanted a corruption-free government. With that hope, hundreds of people joined and I also joined… but now people will not forget this party (AAP) for what they did in the last ten years.”
A three-time councillor and first-time MLA, Gupta also spoke about her political journey — from an ABVP worker to Chief Minister. “I don’t come from a political background… I was the first girl from the Aggarwal samaj to contest university elections… I am happy that today there is a party (BJP), which gives opportunity to people who come from a non-political background,” she said.
Speaking about full statehood for Delhi, which her party demanded till 2014, Gupta said, “The ","Accusing the previous AAP government of dividing Delhi into “two verticals” by ignoring tax-payers, Chief Minister Rekha Gupta said Thursday that people are now “running towards Gurgaon, Faridabad, Noida” in the National Capital Region (NCR) instead of setting up businesses in the city.

Indian Express,2/20/0627,Uttarakhand High Court vacates stay on panchayat elections,"Observing that the repetition of reservation in seats is minuscule and in compliance with Article 243D of the Constitution, the Uttarakhand High Court vacated the stay on panchayat elections and ordered that the process be resumed.
The pleas, which prompted the stay on June 23, were by a clutch of petitioners arguing that the government’s decision to nullify the existing reservation rotation for the panchayat polls and bring about a new rotation has prevented them from being able to contest.
Under the reservation rotation system, constituencies are reserved for various categories for three terms, after which the quota goes to other seats. With a new rotation starting this year, the petitioner had said a seat that had been reserved for the last three terms would again be reserved this year, preventing him from contesting the election.
The division bench of Chief Justice G Narender and Justice Alok Mahra heard the counsel for the government who argued that the repetition was conducted on the recommendations of a report by a committee and was in compliance with the provisions of Article 234 D of the Constitution (pertaining to the reservation of seat in Panchayati Raj system).
While arguing, the counsel for the state had relied on the Supreme Court’s verdicts on withholding elections.
“The apex court has held that withholding election is a breach of constitutional mandate, for any reason, and even the SC cannot do it, even under article 142. This constitutional mandate that elections should proceed at any cost is inviolable,” the Advocate General had said.
On Friday, the HC said that the rulings of the Supreme Court that the counsel relied on elucidated one invariable rule that the constitutional courts may stall the election process where there is no compliance with the constitutional mandate regarding reservation under Article 243-D of the Constitution of India.

Arunachal Times,2023-01-23 00:00:00,Rijiju shares interview of retd judge who says SC ‘hijacked’ constitution by deciding to appoint judges itself,"NEW DELHI, 22 Jan: Law Minister Kiren Rijiju on Sunday sought to support the views of a retired high court judge, who said the Supreme Court “hijacked” the Constitution by deciding to appoint judges itself.
The government and the judiciary have been at loggerheads over the process of appointment of judges to the higher judiciary.
Rijiju shared the video of an interview of retired justice RS Sodhi, a former judge of the Delhi Court, saying it is “voice of a judge” and that majority of people have similar “sane views.”
Justice Sodhi said the right to frame laws lies with Parliament.
The law minister also said that “actually majority of the people have similar sane views. It’s only those people who disregard the provisions of the Constitution and mandate of the people think that they are above the Constitution of India.”
“Real beauty of Indian democracy is its success. People rule themselves through their representatives. Elected representatives represent the interests of the people & make laws. Our judiciary is independent and our Constitution is supreme,” the minister tweeted.
In the interview, Justice Sodhi also said the apex court cannot frame laws as it does not have the right to do so. The right to frame laws belongs to Parliament, he said.
“… Whether you can amend the Constitution? Only Parliament will amend Constitution. But here I feel the Supreme Court for the first time ‘hijacked’ the Constitution. After ‘hijacking’ they (SC) said that we will appoint (judges) ourselves and the government will have no role in it,” Justice Sodhi said in Hindi.
The appointment of judges to the Supreme Court and the high courts has become a major flashpoint between the executive and the judiciary.
While Rijiju has described the collegium system to appoint judges as something “alien” to the Indian Constitution, Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar has questioned the top court for striking down the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act (NJAC) and a related Constitution amendment.
Also the chairman of Rajya Sabha, Dhankar had said that a law passed by Parliament, which reflects the will of the people, was “undone” by the Supreme Court and “the world does not know of any such instance.”
By bringing the NJAC law, the government had sought to overturn the collegium system which came into being in 1992.
The apex court has questioned the government for delay in clearing the appointments of Supreme Court and high court judges.
Last week, the Supreme Court collegium had for the second time reiterated the names of two advocates for appointment as judges of the Calcutta High Court “expeditiously,” saying it was not open for the government to repeatedly send back the same proposal. (PTI)","
Law Minister Kiren Rijiju on Sunday backed retired Justice RS Sodhi’s criticism of the Supreme Court’s role in appointing judges, saying the court had “hijacked” the Constitution by taking over the appointment process. Rijiju shared Sodhi’s interview and claimed many people share this view. Justice Sodhi argued that only Parliament has the right to make and amend laws. The comments come amid ongoing tensions between the government and the judiciary over the collegium system, which Rijiju has called “alien” to the Constitution. The Supreme Court recently criticized the government for delaying judicial appointments.

Indian Express,2/20/0627,"Indus Waters Treaty: India rejects ‘illegal’ arbitration court’s authority, calls it ‘charade’ at Pak behest","India on Friday rejected the authority of an arbitration court “illegally” formed under the Indus Waters Treaty after the body issued a “supplemental award” on its competence to hear cases on the Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric projects in Jammu & Kashmir.
The Indian government has consistently opposed the proceedings of The Hague-based Court of Arbitration ever since its constitution by the World Bank in October 2022.
In a statement Friday, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) termed the move as the “latest charade at Pakistan’s behest” and said that this is an attempt by Islamabad to escape accountability for its role as the global epicentre of terrorism.
“India has never recognised the existence in law of this so-called Court of Arbitration, and India’s position has all along been that the constitution of this so-called arbitral body is in itself a serious breach of the Indus Waters Treaty and consequently any proceedings before this forum and any award or decision taken by it are also for that reason illegal and per se void,” said an MEA statement.
The Court of Arbitration had said Thursday that India’s position of holding the treaty in abeyance “does not deprive the Court of Arbitration of competence”.
India is constructing the Kishenganga project on the Kishenganga river, a tributary of the Jhelum, and the Ratle project on the Chenab river.
In 2015, Pakistan objected to their design features and moved the World Bank to seek a settlement through a neutral expert. But it withdrew its request a year later and asked for adjudication through a Court of Arbitration instead.
India, for its part, sought a neutral expert to rule on the differences. On October 13, 2022, the World Bank appointed Michal Lino as the neutral expert. The same day, it also appointed a Court of Arbitration.
India has opposed the court since then, saying it could not be “compelled to recognise illegal and parallel proceedings not envisaged by the Treaty”.
India has continued participating in the “Treaty-consistent Neutral Expert proceedings”.
The MEA statement on Friday said: “Following the Pahalgam terrorist attack, India has in exercise of its rights as a sovereign nation under international law, placed the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance, until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism. Until such time that the Treaty is in abeyance, India is no longer bound to perform any of its obligations under the Treaty. No Court of Arbitration, much less this illegally constituted arbitral body which has no existence in the eye of law, has the jurisdiction to examine the legality of India’s actions in exercise of its rights as a sovereign.”
The Indus Waters Treaty was signed on September 19, 1960, after nine years of negotiations between India and Pakistan. Then Indian Prime Minister Pt Jawaharlal Nehru and then Pakistani President Mohammed Ayub Khan signed the treaty in Karachi. The treaty has 12 Articles and 8 Annexures (from A to H). A","India on Friday rejected the authority of an arbitration court “illegally” formed under the Indus Waters Treaty after the body issued a “supplemental award” on its competence to hear cases on the Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric projects in Jammu & Kashmir. In a statement Friday, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) termed the move as the “latest charade at Pakistan’s behest” and said that this is an attempt by Islamabad to escape accountability for its role as the global epicentre of terrorism. “India has never recognised the existence in law of this so-called Court of Arbitration, and India’s position has all along been that the constitution of this so-called arbitral body is in itself a serious breach of the Indus Waters Treaty and consequently any proceedings before this forum and any award or decision taken by it are also for that reason illegal and per se void,” said an MEA statement. India is constructing the Kishenganga project on the Kishenganga river, a tributary of the Jhelum, and the Ratle project on the Chenab river.

Indian Express,2/20/0627,Hosabale remarks on Preamble: Rahul says RSS ‘mask has come off’,"A day after RSS general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale sought a discussion on whether the words “socialist” and “secular” should remain in the Preamble, Lok Sabha Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi said “RSS mask” has come off once again, and that the Constitution troubles them “because it speaks of equality, secularism and justice”.
Opposition parties, including the CP(I)M and the RJD, too, condemned Hosabale’s remarks
“…they want Manusmriti. They aim to strip the marginalised and the poor of their rights and enslave them again. Snatching a powerful weapon like the Constitution from them is their real agenda,” said Gandhi in a post on X. “RSS should stop dreaming this dream – we will never let them succeed. Every patriotic Indian will defend the Constitution until their last breath.”
Congress MP and communications in-charge Jairam Ramesh, meanwhile, referred to the November 25 Supreme Court order which dismissed petitions challenging the Constitutional validity of the 42nd amendment — through which the words ‘secular’ and ‘socialist’ were added to the Constitution’s Preamble the Emergency period in 1976,
Ramesh said these terms have achieved “widespread acceptance, with their meanings understood by ‘We, the people of India’ without any semblance of doubt”.
“The Chief Justice of India himself delivered a judgment on November 25, 2024 on the issue now being raised by a leading RSS functionary. Would it be asking too much to request him to take the trouble to read it?” he said.
Ramesh said that the RSS and the BJP “have repeatedly given the call for a new Constitution”. “This was Mr. Modi’s campaign cry during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The people of India decisively rejected this cry. Yet the demands for changing the basic structure of the Constitution continue to be made by the RSS ecosystem,” he said.
On Thursday, Hosabale had said, “The words socialist and secular were added to the Preamble. No attempt was made to remove them later. So, there should be a discussion on whether they should remain. I say this in a building (Ambedkar International Centre) named after Babasaheb Ambedkar, whose Constitution did not have these words in the Preamble.”
RJD chief and former Bihar CM Lalu Prasad said: “The country’s most casteist and hateful organisation RSS has called for changing the Constitution… They do not have the guts to cast an evil eye on the Constitution and reservations provided therein…”
Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said: “Invoking the emergency to discredit these principles is a deceitful move, especially when the RSS colluded with the Indira Gandhi Government during that time for its own survival… To use that period now to undermine the Constitution reflects sheer hypocrisy and political opportunism.”

According to a report, when a group of villagers was cutting trees in preparation for the coming year’s Nyokum celebration, Assam’s forest officials fired in the air to try to stop the villagers.

“The incident took place in the morning hours, way inside Arunachal’s territory. A large number of officials of Assam’s forest department along with police force later reached and tried to intimidate the villagers,” said a local resident.

Later, forest officials of Arunachal and officials of the Kimin administration also rushed to the spot.

The incident assumes significance against the backdrop of the recent issuing of a notice by Assam’s forest officials to the people of Bello, Lora and Gumto villages to vacate the villages, claiming that the land belonged to Assam.

Chief Minister Pema Khandu recently spoke with his Assam counterpart Himanta Biswa Sharma in this regard to resolve the issue. On Monday, the IGPs of both the states, along with the DCs and the SPs of Papum Pare and North Lakhimpur held a meeting in Yupia to try to defuse the tension.","

Indian Express,2/20/0627,F-35B jet to be moved to MRO facility at Kerala airport: UK,"Nearly two weeks after an F-35B ‘Lightning’ stealth fighter jet of the Royal Navy made an emergency landing at the Thiruvananthapuram International Airport and continued to remain grounded, the UK said it has accepted an offer to move the aircraft to the Maintenance Repair and Overhaul facility at the airport.
A British High Commission spokesperson said a UK F-35B aircraft is awaiting repairs at the airport after developing an engineering issue.
“The aircraft will be moved to the hangar once UK engineering teams arrive with specialist equipment, thereby ensuring there is minimal disruption to scheduled maintenance of other aircraft,” the spokesperson said, adding that the aircraft will return to active service once repairs and safety checks have been completed.
“Ground teams continue to work closely with Indian authorities to ensure safety and security precautions are observed. We thank the Indian authorities and Thiruvananthapuram International Airport for their continued support,” the spokesperson said.
Since the emergency landing of the fighter jet on June 14, it has remained unserviceable.
Manufactured by American defence and aerospace major Lockheed Martin and worth over USD 110 million, the F-35B jet is among the most advanced fighter jets in the world.
This fighter jet was operating from the British aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales. The jet was undertaking a routine sortie outside the Indian Air Defence Identification Zone with Thiruvananthapuram earmarked as an emergency recovery airfield.
After that, it could not return to the aircraft carrier after getting caught in adverse weather conditions.
According to officials, Royal Navy technicians from the carrier strike group had earlier attempted to repair the F-35B jet, but were unsuccessful. The aircraft had remained stranded at the airport since then.
HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Richmond had visited India as part of a UK carrier strike group for naval Passage Exercise (PASSEX) in the north Arabian Sea.

Indian Express,2/20/0627,Intensive electoral roll revision: Bihar voters may start getting forms from tomorrow,"Damini Nath
The Election Commission’s “special intensive revision” of the electoral roll in Bihar is likely to start on the ground over the weekend, with around 80,000 Booth Level Officers (BLOs) going house-to-house to distribute forms to each of the existing 7.8 crore registered voters, according to EC officials.
The poll panel had on Tuesday announced the “special intensive revision” of the electoral roll, starting from Wednesday, which will culminate with the publication of the electoral roll on September 30 before the Assembly polls due in November. The last such revision was in 2003. Since then, there have been annual revisions and revisions before the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections with only additions and deletions being made. This time, the roll will be made afresh.
All electors will have to submit forms, which will be pre-filled with their names, Voter ID number, constituency, address etc. For those who enrolled after 2003, age and place of birth proofs for self and parents will also be required. All existing voters will have to submit the forms and documents by July 25, failing which, the EC said, their names will be deleted from the draft roll. They will still get an opportunity to get their names into the final roll.
After the announcement Tuesday, a team of nine senior EC officials, headed by Senior Deputy Election Commissioner Maneesh Garg, visited Patna Thursday and Friday to review the arrangements. The EC team held meetings with the Chief Electoral Officer, the DCs and Electoral Registration Officers.
The process of printing nearly 16 crore forms is likely to be completed by Saturday and the BLOs will likely start distributing them from Sunday, officials said. The pre-filled forms were likely to be available on the ECI’s ECINET app for download by the electors from next week, they said.
On the reasons behind the intensive revision, the EC said Tuesday, “Various reasons such as rapid urbanisation, frequent migration, young citizens becoming eligible to vote, non-reporting of deaths and inclusion of the names of foreign illegal immigrants have necessitated the conduct of an intensive revision so as to ensure integrity and preparation of error-free electoral rolls.”

Indian Express,2/20/0627,New Delhi says Indus Waters Court of Arbitration has ‘no legal standing’: 5 points,"In a sharply-worded response, India has categorically rejected the “supplemental award” issued by what it described as an “illegally-constituted so-called Court of Arbitration” related to the Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric projects in Jammu and Kashmir.
Issued by the Ministry of External Affairs on June 27, the five-point statement calls the panel a “fabricated arbitration mechanism” created at Pakistan’s behest and says India considers all its pronouncements “illegal and per se void.” The ministry pointed out that the Treaty is currently in abeyance due to Islamabad’s continued support for cross-border terrorism and stated that India is no longer bound by its obligations until Pakistan fully dismantles all terror infrastructure.
India said that the so-called Court was constituted in “brazen violation” of the Indus Waters Treaty, making its existence and rulings “illegal and void.”
“The illegal Court of Arbitration, purportedly constituted under the Indus Waters Treaty 1960, albeit in brazen violation of it, has issued what it characterizes as a ‘supplemental award’…”
New Delhi reiterated that it has never recognised the body’s legal standing and that any proceedings or awards from it have no validity under international law.
“India has never recognised the existence in law of this so-called Court of Arbitration… any proceedings before this forum and any award or decision taken by it are also for that reason illegal and per se void.”
India also states that the arbitral body has no legal standing and is a serious breach of the treaty.
India has placed the treaty in abeyance following the Pahalgam terror attack, exercising its sovereign rights, and insists that Pakistan must renounce terrorism before any obligations resume.
“Following the Pahalgam terrorist attack, India has… placed the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance, until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism.”
India also emphasised that it is no longer bound by any obligations under the treaty until Pakistan dismantles terror networks.
India maintained its firm position: it rejects all decisions by the “so-called” court without exception.
“India, therefore, categorically rejects this so-called supplemental award as it has rejected all prior pronouncements of this body.”
The foreign ministry called the arbitration a “charade” orchestrated by Pakistan to divert attention from its role as the “global epicenter of terrorism.”
“This latest charade at Pakistan’s behest is yet another desperate attempt by it to escape accountability for its role as the global epicenter of terrorism… consistent with its decades-long pattern of deception and manipulation of international forums.”

Hindustan Times,2025-05-11 00:00:00,Behind India’s red line: Pak’s tetchy history with bonhomie,"New Delhi : In February 1999, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee crossed the Attari border with a phalanx of stars and celebrities on the inaugural Delhi-Lahore bus service. The bus, painted in the colours of both nations, rolled into Lahore where then Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif welcomed the delegation. Against the backdrop of Mughal-era monuments, the two leaders signed a declaration that seemed to transcend the bitter history of Partition.

The bonhomie was short- lived. In the summer of that year, shepherds tipped off Indian forces that Pakistani soldiers had infiltrated into Kargil and occupied strategic mountains, triggering a full-blown conflict a year after both countries acquired nuclear capabilities.

Two years later, rinse and repeat. In July 2001, then Pakistani PM Pervez Musharraf travelled to Agra as part of an internationally hailed peace summit. Though a pact eluded the leaders, peace seemed tantalisingly close. Six months later, terrorists from Pakistan-sponsored outfits attacked the temple of Indian democracy, killing eight people.

These two instances — one of conventional warfare and another of asymmetric, clandestine terror attack — underlined the risks that might have weighed on the Indian government when officials got the call from Pakistan’s director general of military operations at 3.35pm on Saturday.

“Terrorism itself is part of Pakistan’s foreign policy…Delhi needs to be careful,” said retired Air Vice Marshal, Manmohan Bahadur.

These considerations explained India’s new red line established hours before the ceasefire became public, “India has decided that any future act of terror will be considered an act of war against India and will be responded accordingly,” the officials said. ","The article draws parallels between past peace efforts and subsequent betrayals between India and Pakistan, highlighting the fragile nature of diplomacy between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. It recalls the optimism of the 1999 Delhi-Lahore bus initiative and the 2001 Agra Summit, both of which were followed by major Pakistani military or terrorist provocations—the Kargil War and the Parliament attack. In light of such history, India remains cautious. Officials stated that Delhi will now treat any future terror attack as an act of war, setting a firm new red line just before announcing a ceasefire with Pakistan",International News
Indian Express,2/20/0627,Atal Institute of Medical Super Specialties to be Himachal’s first to perform robotic surgery,"The Atal Institute of Medical Super Specialities (AIMSS) at Chamiyana in Shimla is set to become the first medical institute in Himachal Pradesh to introduce surgeries using cutting-edge robotic technology. A state-of-the-art surgical robot — procured at a cost of Rs 28 crore on the lines of AIIMS Delhi — has already arrived at the institute. The installation process is expected to be completed by July, following which robotic-assisted surgeries will commence.
Dr Brij Lal, principal, AIMSS Chamiyana, said that robotic surgery will offer significant benefits to both patients and doctors. “Robotic procedures require only small incisions, resulting in minimal blood loss, reduced need for transfusions, and faster recovery for patients. They experience less pain and are discharged sooner,” he said.
Doctors too will gain from the technology, as robotic systems enhance surgical precision and control. “Surgeons experience less fatigue, even during prolonged operations, enabling them to perform more procedures efficiently. The technology provides a clear, magnified 3D view of narrow and complex areas within the body, significantly reducing the risk of errors,” Lal added.
Meanwhile, a government spokesperson said in a bid to further strengthen healthcare infrastructure in Himachal Pradesh, Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu is set to visit Dr Rajendra Prasad Government Medical College (RPGMC), Tanda. As part of the visit, a detailed presentation will be made on the ongoing and proposed improvements in medical services and infrastructure at the institute. “The CM will also engage in an interactive session with the faculty members to gather feedback and suggestions, focusing on enhancing healthcare delivery at this key medical institution,” the spokesperson added.

Indian Express,2/20/0627,"High Court points to Sita Aur Geeta and Ram Lakhan, asks why CBFC objects to title of Janaki vs State of Kerala","The Kerala High Court on Friday asked what the problem was with the title of the Malayalam film, Janaki vs State of Kerala, after the Central Board of Film Certification demanded that it be changed.
The producers of the film, starring actor and Union minister Suresh Gopi, approached the High Court against the delay in CBFC certification for the film that had been scheduled for release on Friday (June 27).
Following opposition to the CBFC’s first demand for a change in the title of the film, the matter was taken up by the Revising Committee of the board, which also called for the name change. The word the CBFC wants changed is Janaki, another name for Goddess Sita, which is also the name of the main character in the film.
When the matter came up for hearing in the High Court, Justice N Nagaresh pointed out there had been several films that have names of Gods in the title, and that there had so far been no problem. “Then, how come for Janaki there is a complaint?” the judge asked. The court observed that there had been films such Sita Aur Geeta (1972) and Ram Lakhan (1989).
The CBFC informed the court that it had issued a notice to the producers, saying the film could be sanctioned for public exhibition if they carry out a change in the name of the lead character, Janaki, from the title and from dialogue. The notice also said the Revising Committee came to the conclusion.
It said the film deals with mature content, which includes sexual crime against women, strong sexual language/words, references to drugs, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Considering the same, the Revising Committee unanimously recommended the grant of ‘UA 16+’ with the modifications.
Subsequently, the court directed the CBFC to place the notice before it on the next day of hearing on June 30, even asking the film producers to either reply to the notice or appeal against it.
Supreme Court advocate and Rajya Sabha member Haris Beeran, who appeared for the producer, Cosmos Entertainment, said the board has no right to issue such a notice. It is untenable under the cinematograph certification rules. “We are going to challenge the notice as filing a reply will only further delay the release of the film,” he said.

Arunachal Times,2021-11-24 00:00:00,Capital witnesses 12-hr bandh,"ITANAGAR, 23 Nov: The 12-hour capital bandh imposed by the All Nyishi Students’ Union (ANSU) by and large passed off peacefully on Tuesday.

Even though there was no report of any major violence, for a brief period in the afternoon there was a tense standoff outside the civil secretariat when ANSU activists protested against Chief Secretary Naresh Kumar’s attending office.

However, the situation was brought under control by way of hectic parleys by IGP (Law & Order) Chukhu Apa and Itanagar Capital Region DC Talo Potom, who spoke with ANSU president Nabam Dodum and GS Gora Rikam to clear the secretariat area. However, ANSU activists allegedly burnt down an APSTS bus that was parked outside the secretariat, and a vehicle of the magistrate. Apart from this, there was no major report of violence. The ANSU imposed the 12-hour bandh to press its demand for immediate transfer of Education Commissioner Niharika Rai and withdrawal of an FIR lodged against the central executive members of the union.

Meanwhile, speaking to the media, the ANSU president blamed the chief secretary for the violence outside the civil secretariat.

“We demanded that he immediately leave the office. But, citing some excuses, he kept delaying and provoking the activists. Otherwise, we maintained utmost restraint during the whole day,” Dodum said.

He also alleged that IAS and IPS officers coming from mainland India do not respect the local sentiments. “We will not tolerate this kind of arrogant attitude of IAS and IPS officers coming from mainland India,” he said.

The ANSU president urged the elected MLAs to lead the state and stop fearing IAS and IPS officers. “Right now, a group of bureaucrats who all hail from mainland India and do not know the local issues are running the show. Elected leaders are sidelined. It is time our leaders also worked for our own people and stopped behaving like assistants of these bureaucrats,” Dodum said.

 He further said that the ANSU would intensify its agitation in the coming days if the government fails to respond to its two-point demand.


“We will soon hold a meeting of central executive members and will take a decision on the further course of action. In the next few days, we will also wait to see how the government responds to our demand,” added Dodum.","
The 12-hour bandh in Itanagar called by the All Nyishi Students’ Union (ANSU) over demands for the transfer of Education Commissioner Niharika Rai and withdrawal of an FIR against union members largely remained peaceful. However, tensions flared outside the civil secretariat when ANSU activists protested against Chief Secretary Naresh Kumar's presence in office. Despite intervention by IGP (Law & Order) Chukhu Apa and DC Talo Potom, an APSTS bus and a magistrate's vehicle were reportedly set on fire. ANSU president Nabam Dodum blamed the chief secretary for provoking protesters and criticized bureaucrats from mainland India for allegedly ignoring local sentiments. The union warned of intensifying agitation if their demands remain unaddressed.

Hindustan Times,2025-05-11 00:00:00,"IN 4 DAYS, INDIA DAMAGED TERROR INFRA, HIT CRUCIAL MILITARY FACILITIES","New Delhi : The US-brokered ceasefire between India and Pakistan has for now ended hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours who were on the brink of a full-blown shooting war after military confrontations escalated sharply during the last four days as India struck several terror sites, air bases and military installations in Pakistan which made desperate attempts to hit military infrastructure and civilian areas in several Indian states.

A halt to the fighting -- at least on paper; there were reports of Pakistan violating the ceasefire across the Line of Control -- has prevented a wider conflict and put the spotlight on the battle outcomes for the two sides after India launched Operation Sindoor in the early hours of May 7.

“We smashed the terror infrastructure there, hit their air defences and targeted several of their airbases. The Indian forces had a good run... Pakistan’s counter-offensive was mostly thwarted,” said one of the officials.","The US-brokered ceasefire has temporarily halted four days of intense military confrontations between India and Pakistan, triggered by India's Operation Sindoor in retaliation for the Pahalgam terror attack.

Indian Express,2/20/0627,How Uttarakhand man was rescued from bonded labour in Punjab – with some help,"For the family of Rajesh, an Uttarakhand resident who was rescued from bonded labour in Punjab on June 15, it’s a reunion after 17 years, albeit a painful one.
Last week, a video from Punjab’s Tarn Taran went viral, showing Rajesh at a cow shed, dishevelled and in visible distress. An NGO rescued him from the family that had kept him as a bonded labourer, prompting Garhwal MP Anil Baluni to seek his return through the Governor of the state, Gulab Chand Kataria.
Rajesh, currently at the Tarn Taran district hospital, has shown mental distress and requires treatment. “He could not identify me, but quickly recalled our parents,” said his sister Rajeshwari, who last saw him in 2008, when she was 9. “I recognised him, but he had changed. He recounted the ordeal, and we took him to the hospital for a medical examination.”
Rajesh left home when he was 18, ostensibly in search of work. “He didn’t contact us, and we didn’t know he was in Punjab. I got married to a man in Punjab and came here. It was shocking to know he was in Tarn Taran,” she said.
Speaking to The Indian Express, Baluni said he stumbled on the video after a YouTuber and the head of the NGO, Jagjeet Singh, posted it. “When I came to know, I spoke with the family. I contacted the Governor to seek his return,” he said. In his post on X earlier, Baluni wrote, “The Honorable Governor expressed concern on this issue and assured me that after a thorough investigation of this incident, Rajesh’s location will be tracked and he will be rescued and taken to his native village as soon as possible.”
Jagjeet Singh, who runs the NGO Baba Ratan Dev Sewa Society, got the tipoff from a viewer of his channel. “We visit places where human rights violations are reported. This time, his neighbour informed us that three men were being made to work for over 20 hours a day and mistreated by the family that owns the cattle shed. The men were sleeping near the cattle, with cow dung all around them,” he said.
When they confronted the employers, their statements didn’t match with the account of the labourers and the informant. “The police were cooperative… MP Anil Baluni also called the Governor to facilitate his return,” he said.
On June 15, his sister saw the video posted by the NGO and approached them. “He was assaulted day and night, made to work through the year, and not allowed to step out. Once, he tried to escape, but was caught and beaten up,” she said.
Singh said that once the family was informed, they were asked to report an identification mark. “He had fractured his finger during childhood, and they recalled this. When we checked, he had a crooked finger,” he said.

Expressing concern over the recent incident in Kimin and Kakoi circles, Papum Pare DC Pige Ligu said, “Efforts should be made from both sides to prevent occurrences of such incidents in future, besides working to maintain age-old bonhomie in the foothill areas by maintaining the status quo on the issue of boundary.”


The DC also highlighted the problems that the people residing in the boundary areas face, such as lack of basic amenities like roads, power and water supply, and opined that “development should be given a chance in such areas to improve the living condition of the people on humanitarian basis.”

Terming the recent incident “unfortunate,” North Lakhimpur DC Sumit Sattawan said that “boundary-related issues should be addressed in a proper forum.” He urged the Papum Pare administration to “halt the ongoing PMGSY road construction till further discussion and awareness campaign among people living in boundary areas.”

Sattawan also clarified that “no eviction will be done to existing structures, and eviction is done only to newly constructed structures in disputed areas, that too after following due process of law, and hence people should not panic.”

Arunachal Pradesh IGP (Law & Order) Chukhu Apa and his Assam counterpart Deepak Kedia stressed on proper coordination between both sides to ensure mutual understanding between the two states and seek a peaceful solution to such issues.

Assam’s APCCF PJ Vijayakar and DFO AK Dev Choudhury and Banderdewa DFO Chukhu Loma also spoke.

The meeting was also attended by the Papum Pare SP, officers of the forest departments of both the states, the ADCs of Yupia and Kimin, EACs and COs. (DIPRO)","
In response to recent tensions in Kimin and Kakoi circles, the Papum Pare district administration held an interstate coordination meeting with officials from Assam’s North Lakhimpur district. Papum Pare DC Pige Ligu emphasized the need to prevent future incidents and preserve peaceful relations by maintaining the status quo along the boundary. He also stressed the importance of development in border areas. North Lakhimpur DC Sumit Sattawan termed the recent incident “unfortunate” and called for a pause in PMGSY road construction until further dialogue. He assured that evictions would only target newly built structures in disputed zones and follow legal procedures.

Indian Express,2/20/0627,‘Zumba is harmful to moral life of students’: Religious groups slam Kerala bid to bring dance-based fitness programme to schools,"Some religious groups in Kerala have raised concerns about the CPI(M)-led government’s plan to introduce Zumba, a dance-based fitness programme, in schools. They argued that the “Western import” would have an adverse effect on morality.
The state Education Department recently decided to teach Zumba in all schools as part of efforts to drive students away from drug abuse and violence, and to improve their physical and mental fitness. Last month, ahead of the beginning of the current academic year, the Education Department had given training to teachers as part of their annual refresher programmes.
However, Abdul Samad Pookkottor, a prominent cleric belonging to SAMASTHA, a clerical body known for its pro-IUML stand, said: “Zumba is harmful to the moral life of students. Prayer is the best for mental well-being. We also have yoga. This is an import from the Western world. If the government insists that Zumba dance should be implemented, our clerics will fight against it. Girls and boys should not be allowed to mingle under the pretext of the Zumba dance. Should we require this dance programme from Colombia? Our students should be allowed to maintain morality. Let the government appoint physical education teachers in all schools.”
Another cleric, Nazar Faizy Koodathai, said students should not be compelled into “vulgarity”.
“If well-built students are also forced to dance wearing minimum clothes and mingling with the opposite sex, it is highly deplorable. Instead of introducing Zumba, let the government focus on physical training programmes. Students should not be forced into vulgarity,” he said.
The Indian Union Muslim League’s student wing, the Muslim Students Federation, also came out against the decision. IUML state president P K Navas said, “This was unilaterally introduced in schools without conducting a study.”
While chairing a meeting convened to address increasing incidents of teenage violence and drug abuse, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had suggested the idea of introducing Zumba in schools to ease stress and make students more active.
In 2022, the Left Front government had decided to introduce gender-neutral uniforms and other reforms in the education sector. A school curriculum committee had also suggested doing away with separate seats for boys and girls in schools as part of bringing gender neutrality. However, the government was forced to recall the reforms in the wake of protests from religious organisations.

The accused had returned after spending a decade in Goa, where he ran ‘The Krantis’, teaching what he called Kranti Yoga to many, including foreigners.
The accused, Tarun Kranti Agrawal alias Sonu, recently purchased a property spanning 5 acres of land near the Pragya Giri hills, located barely two kilometres from the Dongargarh temple, also a popular tourist destination.
A few months later, Kanti began construction work to set up an ashram on the premises. However, earlier this month, the local Dongargarh police started receiving complaints about drugs allegedly being served on the premises to minors and tourists. According to the police, it was also alleged that some youngsters at the place were carrying knives.
“We received information about unlawful activities taking place on the premises, after which we raided the place on June 25. We found 1.993 kg of cannabis in his possession. He was arrested under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act and remanded to judicial custody. We suspect he was selling drugs on the premises,” said the Rajnandgaon Superintendent of Police, Mohit Garg.
Agrawal’s parents are businessmen, and he is a native of Dongargarh. He left his home two decades ago, police said.
“Agrawal claimed before us (the police) that he has visited many countries and runs 10 NGOs. We will be seizing his passport, and we have received information about a few NGOS that he is referring to. We will check the activities of these organisations,” said an official.
Agrawal has been booked under section 20 B (produces, manufactures, possesses, sells, purchases, transports, imports inter-State, exports inter-State or uses cannabis) of the NDPS Act.

Indian Express,2021-01-01 00:00:00,"Delhi getsfirst model vaccination centre in Sriniwaspuri, police plan security cover","As part of arrangements for the arrival and storage of the Covid-19 vaccine, a maternity home in Sriniwaspuri has been converted into the capital’s first model vaccination centre by the South Corporation. Police, meanwhile, have asked all DCPs to draw up a security plan for transportation of the vaccine from Indira Gandhi International Airport to 621 vaccine stores, including Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital—the biggest storage facility—11 district vaccine stores and 609 peripheral vaccine stores.

According to SDMC councillor Raj Pal, the maternity home was converted in accordance with guidelines issued by the Union Health Ministry. A visit to the centre showed that it has been divided into three parts—a waiting area, a vaccination room and an observation room. The centre has a lounge where Aadhaar-based registration will be carried out. Following screening, vaccine candidates will be sent to the waiting area. The vaccination room has been readied with a first-aid kit. An ambulance will be parked outside in case of emergencies.

Each centre will have a vaccination officer—who would either be a doctor, nurse or a pharmacist—to help with registration and authentication of documents. Arrangements for cold storage at the centre have also been made. Pal said other centres would also be developed along similar lines. “Earlier this year, we were busy setting up Covid isolation centres. It feels good that the new year will start with a vaccine centre,” he said.

According to Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain: “The Delhi government is ready for the vaccine. All necessary arrangements, from storage to application, have been made. We are preparing 1,000 centres and are waiting for the vaccine to be made available.”

Police to make security arrangements:
An order issued Wednesday by Special CP (operations and licensing) Dr. Muktesh Chander, following approval from the Police Commissioner, states: “Delhi government will set up vaccination centres where about 100 persons will be vaccinated every day. Beneficiaries will be informed about the date, time, and place via SMS. Local police and police control rooms (PCRs) should locate such places and make arrangements for security and law and order.”

It further states that proper security arrangements will have to be made at the airport when the vaccine arrives. “PCR vans will escort these vaccines to primary, then secondary and finally to territory stores. All possible assistance should be provided by traffic police for smooth transport of these vaccines. Local police should make round-the-clock security arrangements at the storage sites, and PCR vans should also cover these sites in their patrolling plans,” states the order.

Chander also directed the central police control room to respond promptly to calls for help from cold storage points or vaccination sites, and pass on the information to PCR vans, local police, traffic police and any other agency. “A test message has already been sent to all police personnel about Covid-19 vaccination. If any personnel have not received such a message, it indicates that their number has not been updated on the personal information system (PIS). Police personnel in districts as well as in units should update it by January 3. Information has also been sought about police personnel below the age of 50 but having some comorbidity… this data should be updated on PIS; place of vaccination will be near the place of work as far as possible,” it states.

According to DCP (Shahdara) Amit Sharma—under whose jurisdiction Rajiv Gandhi Hospital falls—police have made all arrangements for the vaccine.","To prepare for Covid-19 vaccine distribution, a maternity home in Sriniwaspuri was converted into Delhi’s first model vaccination centre, with facilities for registration, vaccination, and observation. Delhi plans to establish 1,000 such centres. The South Corporation and police have coordinated efforts for secure vaccine transport and storage.

“The RSS and the BJP have repeatedly given the call for a new Constitution. This was Mr. Modi’s campaign cry during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The people of India decisively rejected this cry. Yet the demands for changing the basic structure of the Constitution continue to be made by the RSS ecosystem,” he said.
“The Chief Justice of India himself delivered a judgment on November 25, 2024 on the issue now being raised by a leading RSS functionary. Would it be asking too much to request him to take the trouble to read it?” asked Ramesh.
He was referring to the Supreme Court order on November 25 last year, when it had dismissed petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the 42nd amendment by which the words ‘secular’ and ‘socialist’ were added to the Preamble of the Constitution during the Emergency period in 1976, saying “these terms have achieved widespread acceptance, with their meanings understood by ‘We, the people of India’ without any semblance of doubt”.
A bench of then Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar said Parliament’s power under Article 368 to amend the Constitution also extends to the Preamble and rejected the argument that the words could not have been added retrospectively in 1976 to the original Preamble which has a cut-off date of November 26, 1949.
On Thursday, Hosabale not only asked the Congress to apologise to the country for imposing the Emergency but also made a strong pitch for a discussion on whether the words “socialist” and “secular”, inserted in the Preamble of the Constitution during the Emergency days, should continue to remain.
In a statement, Congress MP and whip in Lok Sabha, Manickam Tagore, said: “The RSS always wanted the Constitution to be attacked, and to be removed… We all know RSS stands for Manuvad and they want to spread hate. They call themselves a cultural organisation, not a political one. We all know the attack on words like secularism and socialism is an attack on the Constitution and parliamentary democracy. We will fight for the Constitution.”

Indian Express,2/20/0627,"Diesel mixed with water, 19 vehicles in Madhya Pradesh CM’s convoy break down, petrol pump sealed","Nineteen vehicles from Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Mohan Yadav’s convoy broke down after being filled with contaminated diesel late Thursday night.
The incident occurred when the convoy stopped at a petrol pump located near Dosigaon village on the Indore-Mhow road for refuelling, unaware that the fuel being dispensed was allegedly mixed with water. About 5,995 litres of petrol and 10,675 litres of diesel from the petrol pump have been sealed.
Some vehicles managed to leave the fuel station but stalled on the highway shortly after, while others could not even move from the pump.
CM Yadav is in Ratlam for a regional industry skill and development conclave. The 19 vehicles were supposed to be part of Yadav’s convoy on Friday.
The district administration has clarified that the incident may have happened after heavy rains in the district led to water seeping “into the diesel tank of the petrol pump which led to the vehicles coming to an abrupt halt.”
The food and civil supplies department staff immediately collected samples and analysed them, confirming the presence of water in the diesel supplied by the concerned pump.

“Entire matter is being probed, though the exact quantity of water cannot be specified immediately. The stock at the pump is being checked and findings will be summed up in the detailed report to the Ratlam district collector,” a senior official of the food and civil supplies department Anand Gole said.
Shubham Parmar, a driver from the convoy, told the local media that the vehicles were on their way from Indore for the Chief Minister’s programme on Friday. “We came from Indore and got down at a petrol pump and refuelled. The first few vehicles that left the petrol pump stopped on the highway, but the others stopped at the petrol pump itself.”
The driver said that when they checked the fuel, they found it was mixed with water, following which the local officials were alerted.

Hindustan Times,2025-05-12 00:00:00,"Objectives achieved, India sets ‘new normal’ in fighting terror","New Delhi : India set a new normal in dealing with terrorism emanating from Pakistan using Operation Sindoor that is not yet over, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday, adding that New Delhi’s ferocious but proportionate response forced Islamabad’s hand.

India’s actions, which had clear military, political and psychological objectives, made it clear to both Pakistan and international interlocutors that New Delhi’s response to cross-border terrorism will raise costs for backing and financing terror groups based in Pakistan that have been involved in attacks over the decades, the people said.

“The actions taken by India are aimed at creating and setting a new normal in the relationship. It is not business as usual. Pakistan and the world will have to get used to this new normal because India has had enough,” a person said.

The developments came a day after the two countries reached an understanding on halting military actions, after four days of escalating conflict involving drones, missiles and long-range weapons had raised fears of a full-blown war.

Within 15 minutes of concluding the first set of military strikes on terrorist infrastructure at nine locations in Pakistan and Pakistan Occupied Kashmir between 1.04am and 1.30 am on May 7, the Indian Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) informed his Pakistani counterpart that the attacks were directed only at terror groups and the Indian side was ready to talk, the people, familiar with the intricacies of Operation Sindoor, said on condition of anonymity. The first strikes were in response to the April 22 terror attack at Pahalgam in Kashmir.

There was no response from the Pakistani side and the people said Prime Minister Narendra Modi issued clear instructions to the armed forces – India’s retaliation to any action by the Pakistani military should be “bigger and stronger”.

One of the people quoted Modi as saying, “Wahan se goli chalegi, toh yahan se gola chalega (If they fire bullets, we will respond with cannons).”

India achieved the military objective of Operation Sindoor, which was to destroy the targeted terrorist infrastructure, within half an hour of the launch of its strikes on May 7, and the political objective, which was to raise the cost of backing cross-border terrorism, the people added.

Noting that the government has spoken of having a strategy of striking terrorists within Pakistan – or as one person put it, “ghar me ghus ke marenge (kill them in their homes) – the people said this too had been achieved. “The terrorists were struck in the heartland of Pakistan, not at the border,” a second person said.

“The cost of terrorism has increased. The Indus Waters Treaty is linked to the cross-border terrorism and it will be held in abeyance as long as terrorism from Pakistan continues,” the second person said.

The people said the cost for Pakistan’s backing of terrorism will rise proportionately and while terrorism may not end with the latest strikes on groups deep within Pakistan, India will respond to every act of terrorism. The Indian side also called the bluff of Pakistan’s deterrence, and the Line of Control (LoC), the international border or Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal will not protect the terrorists, they said.

The people said these factors set Operation Sindoor – launched in retaliation for the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians – apart from the surgical strikes across the Line of Control after the 2016 Uri terror attack and the air strike on Balakot in Pakistan’s Kyber-Pakhtunkhwa province after the 2019 Pulwama suicide bombing that killed 40 Indian troops.

“The Indus Waters Treaty survived three wars and a four-decade-long campaign of cross-border terrorism. Essentially, the point is that Pakistan cannot carry on with cross-border terrorism while expecting cooperation in areas of its own choosing,” the first person said.

After India’s initial strikes on terror infrastructure early on May 7, Pakistan attacked Indian military bases on May 8, 9 and 10, triggering progressively stronger responses from the Indian side that targeted Pakistani military facilities ranging from air defence systems to radar sites and command and control centres, the people said. Pakistan’s “most ambitious and wide-ranging attacks” were on May 10, when they attempted to strike 26 military locations with heavier calibre weapons, even though the Indian side repeatedly said there was no intention to escalate, the people said.

It was then that the Indian side decided to raise the military cost for Pakistan and the armed forces responded with “hellfire” by striking eight of Pakistan’s main airbases, including Chaklala, Rafiqui, Murid, Rahim Yar Khan, Chunian and Sialkot, with precision weapons, the first person said. The damage caused by these strikes was extensive and the runway at the Rahim Yar Khan airbase was devastated, he said.

After four days of intense confrontations involving drones, missiles and long-range weapons, the DGMOs of the two sides reached an understanding on halting military actions on Saturday afternoon.

“The Pakistanis stopped not because the Americans called them and told them to — in very nice English. They stopped because things were falling down on them from the sky. And making a very loud noise,” the second person said. The people also said that the ceasefire was arrived at on India’s terms and wasn’t forced on New Delhi. The cessation of hostilities was announced by US President Donald Trump around 5.30pm on Saturday and confirmed by India half an hour later, though Pakistan violated the understanding for about three hours on Saturday night. The ceasefire largely held on Sunday.

The strikes and counter-strikes of May 10 showed the stark difference in the technological capabilities and precision weapons of the two sides, and the force of the Indian response showed the Pakistani side that this was not going to be a “winning proposition”, the people said.

The people also explained the rationale behind India’s choice of the nine locations in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) where terrorist infrastructure was targeted, particularly the Jaish-e-Mohammed’s (JeM) main “markaz” or base at Bahawalpur, the Lashkar-e-Taiba’s (LeT) stronghold at Muridke, both in Pakistan’s Punjab province, and bases of groups such as Harkat-ul-Mujahideen and Harkat-ul-Ansar at Muzaffarabad, the capital of PoK.

“One thing that joins all these facilities together is that they are intimately tied to the Pakistani deep state’s complicity with and sponsorship of terrorism over a long period. These facilities, the organisations that they house, the terrorists that are based there, they all have a long track record of activity against India,” the first person said.

The JeM base at Bahawalpur was among the first three targets struck on May 7 and it was hit with the “most potent weapon available”, the people said, recalling JeM founder Masood Azhar’s link to several brazen attacks in India since he formed the group after being freed from an Indian jail along with two terrorists in exchange for the passengers of the hijacked flight IC-814 in 2000. These attacks included the assault on India’s Parliament in December 2001.

The JeM and LeT bases were also chosen because of the long-standing links between these groups and Pakistan’s military and intelligence, especially in the context of terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir and other parts of India, the people said. In purely psychological terms, the people said, the Indian side wanted to send across the message to the terror groups that “no place is safe”, and India’s armed forces are capable of going deep into “Pakistani territory in the mainland and hitting targets that are identified with their security establishment”.

The people also pointed to the evidence that emerged following the attack on Muridke of senior Pakistani military and civilian officials attending the funeral of people killed at the LeT’s sprawling base on the outskirts of Lahore.

“The funeral of terrorists being conducted with coffins wrapped in flags and military officers present should put to rest the myth that the terrorists are only linked with Pakistan’s intelligence agencies. These terrorists are linked with the entire Pakistani society – the deputy commissioner of Lahore was there and there was representation from the Punjab chief minister’s office,” the first person said, referring to photos and videos that have emerged of the funeral.","India’s Operation Sindoor, launched on May 7, marks a strategic shift in its approach to cross-border terrorism, targeting terror infrastructure deep inside Pakistan and Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK) in retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack. The Indian military struck nine terror hubs, including those of JeM (Bahawalpur), LeT (Muridke), and others in Muzaffarabad, using advanced precision weapons.

The operation aimed to raise the cost of Pakistan’s support for terrorism, militarily and politically, and to establish a “new normal” — making it clear that future terror attacks will be treated as acts of war. While Pakistan launched drone and missile counterattacks, India escalated by hitting key Pakistani airbases like Chaklala and Sialkot.

India also linked the Indus Waters Treaty to cross-border terrorism, putting it in abeyance. A ceasefire was reached on May 11 following intense retaliation from India, not international pressure, according to Indian officials. Though brokered diplomatically, India insists it happened on its own terms. The ceasefire has largely held, and India's assertive posture marks a paradigm shift in its national security doctrine.",Defence
Indian Express,2/20/0627,Over 180 companies of paramilitary forces deployed for Amarnath Yatra in Jammu,"The 38-day-long yatra is scheduled to start on July 3 from the twin routes — the traditional 48-kilometre Pahalgam route in Anantnag district and the shorter but steeper 14-kilometre Baltal route in the Ganderbal district — leading to the 3,880-metre-high holy cave shrine of Amarnath. The first batch of pilgrims will leave for Kashmir from the Jammu-based Bhagwati Nagar base camp a day before the start of the yatra.
“The administration is ready and committed to ensuring a successful yatra this year. Jammu and Kashmir Police has made multi-tier security arrangements for the yatra,” Inspector General of Police (IGP), Jammu Zone, Bhim Sen Tuti told reporters here.
Tuti, who along with divisional commissioner, Jammu, Ramesh Kumar chaired a high-level meeting to review arrangements, including security, for the yatra, said, “Just like we have been providing security in previous years, this year, even better arrangements are being made, whether in terms of the number of paramilitary forces, deployment in sensitive areas, or CCTV surveillance. Compared to earlier, more vigilant and multi-layered security is being ensured.” Replying to a question about the deployment of forces for the yatra in the region, he said, “Apart from Jammu and Kashmir Police, more than 180 companies of paramilitary forces have been deployed for the yatra.” He said that security forces have been deployed along the Jammu Kashmir National Highway from Lakhanpur to Banihal. “From road opening parties to CCTV cameras, everything has been set up, and security has also been provided at langars, lodging centres. There was no ROP (road opening party) arrangement from Lakhanpur to Jammu last year, but this year there will be ROP here as well,” he said.
The IGP added that starting from July 2, the traffic police will issue a daily advisory. “Cut-off timings will be fixed at all points related to yatra movement. All pilgrims who wish to participate in the yatra must follow this advisory so that there are no problems or inconveniences,” he said.
He said all pilgrims are advised to join the main convoy that departs between 4:00 and 4:30 am. “Traveling individually will not be appropriate. Those travelling with the official convoy are provided with a secure environment, and it is safer to travel in an organised and protected setup,” he said.

Indian Express,2/20/0627,Lanka arrests Indian fishermen because their rights were given up during Emergency: Jaishankar,"External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said Friday that Sri Lankan authorities are arresting Indian fishermen because of an Emergency-era agreement that gave up fishing rights in some areas.
“At the time, several big decisions would be taken without a debate. These days, there is a discussion about our fishermen going to Sri Lanka and getting arrested there. That is because of an agreement signed with Sri Lanka at the time of Emergency under which the rights of the fishermen to fish in some part of Sri Lankan waters were given up by us,” he said at a BJP youth wing event to mark the 50th anniversary of the Emergency.
Tamil Nadu’s DMK government has repeatedly raised the issue with the Union government. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this year, calling for the return of Katchatheevu island that was handed over to Sri Lanka through agreements signed in 1974 and 1976.
The decades-old dispute resurfaced last year after Modi posted on X that the Congress “callously gave away” Katchatheevu to Sri Lanka in the 1970s.
Government data shows Sri Lanka has arrested more than 528 Indian fishermen in 2024.
Jaishankar said: “If it wasn’t for an Emergency Parliament, if Parliament at the time was a genuine Parliament, there would have been a debate and I don’t know if the Parliament would have allowed such an agreement,” he said. “The decisions taken at the time still show their impact in the state of Tamil Nadu.” The state is expected to go to the polls next year.
The External Affairs Minister also took aim at the Congress party, stating that one family’s interests were placed above the nation during the Emergency.
“There’s a movie titled Kissa Kursi Ka… these three words aptly tell the reason behind the imposition of the Emergency. When a family is considered above the nation, things like Emergency take place,” Jaishankar said.
He stated that during that time he was a 20 year-old student at Jawaharlal Nehru University, and the biggest lesson from the Emergency was to never take one’s freedom for granted.
In a reference to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Jaishankar said: “Some people flash the Constitution in but the feeling in their hearts is different… Political parties also have a DNA and they have, to date, never expressed regret for imposing Emergency.”
Responding to the remarks, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said in a post on X: “What I can tell the EAM is to please tell us what President Trump is saying. What is his trade deal? Why is President Trump repeatedly claiming credit for the ceasefire? EAM would be well advised to deal with the complete collapse of Indian diplomacy… He should be worried about repairing the damage to Indian diplomacy rather than getting into the history of what happened 50 years ago.”
Later, speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the event, Jaishankar hailed the global outreach after Operation Sindoor. “I have a great sense of pride when I see Parliamentary delegations led by",Yash Pathak,International News

Said Rajesh Kumar, DSP (Bawal), “Around 20–25 tractors managed to break through the barricades this afternoon and enter Rewari. We had to use water cannons and teargas shells to stop them but they managed to move forward.”

Leaders from groups associated with the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha distanced themselves from the group. “Until the protest carries on under the banner of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, we will follow what the leaders say; we are all disciplined. There is a group of protesters who, from the beginning, have been wanting to force their way through… This is not part of our plan, we are trying to create pressure on the government, make people aware. We are not here to fight or get into a confrontation or damage things,” said Ramzan Chaudhary, head of the Nuh unit of the Jai Kisan Andolan that has also been protesting under the banner of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha.

Farmers from Rajasthan and Haryana have been protesting at the border since December 13, with people from other states, including Gujarat and Maharashtra, joining them in the days since, resulting in their numbers swelling from barely 200 to around 1,500 now.

A representative of Swaraj India said, “There are some youth who have broken through the barricades. They have been here for some time and were getting impatient. We had been trying to convince them since the morning to not force their way, that we had to stay here and strengthen the movement, but they felt they needed to move towards Delhi.”

“Only 12 or 13 tractors have gone through, the rest of the protesters are still at the border and will continue to remain there until they receive any directions otherwise from the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha leaders... Talks are also on to convince those who went through to continue the protest peacefully,” he said.","A group of protesting farmers at the Haryana-Rajasthan border broke through police barricades in Rewari en route to Delhi, despite efforts by leaders to maintain peaceful demonstrations.

Indian Express,2/20/0627,India finds out about decisions important to it from White House: Congress takes dig on India-US trade deal,"With US President Donald Trump announcing that a “very big” trade deal is on the cards with India, the Congress on Friday took a swipe at the government and said it seems that India gets to know decisions of great importance to it from the White House.
The opposition party’s swipe at the government came after President Donald Trump said a “very big” trade deal is on the cards with India, hinting at significant progress in the negotiation process of a long-awaited bilateral trade agreement between the two countries.
“We are having some great deals. We have one coming up, maybe with India. Very big one. Where we’re going to open up India,” said Trump while speaking at the ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ event at the White House.
Congress general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh said that “after repeating 16 times” that he used a trade deal as an instrument to bring about a ceasefire between India & Pakistan, Trump has now announced that the India-US trade agreement is going to be signed in the next few days.
“He calls it a ‘very big deal.’ It better be – given that it led to the abrupt end of Operation Sindoor,” Ramesh said on X.
“As is now becoming evident, India has to get to know decisions of great importance to it from the White House in Washington DC,” the Congress leader said.
Trump’s remarks come as an Indian team headed by chief negotiator Rajesh Agarwal on Thursday arrived in Washington for the next round of trade talks with the US.
Both countries are engaged in negotiations for an interim trade deal and are trying to finalise the pact before July 9.
The high tariffs announced by the US on April 2 were suspended by the Trump administration till July 9.
The agriculture and dairy sectors are difficult and challenging areas for India to give duty concessions to the US. India has not opened up dairy in any of its free trade pacts signed so far.
The US wants duty concessions on certain industrial goods, automobiles – especially electric vehicles, wines, petrochemical products, dairy, and agricultural items like apples, tree nuts, and genetically modified crops.
India is seeking duty concessions for labour-intensive sectors like textiles, gems and jewellery, leather goods, garments, plastics, chemicals, shrimp, oil seeds, grapes, and bananas in the proposed trade pact.

An Indian ePassport will be a paper and electronic passport which includes a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Chip and an antenna implanted in the passport’s inlay and holds the passport holder’s personal and biometric information. It will be immediately recognised as a little supplementary gold colour insignia printed beneath the passport’s front cover.
The key benefit of the ePassport is the increased ability to safeguard the integrity of the passport holder’s data. It will have the data printed on the booklet as well as digitally signed in the electronic chip, which can be securely authenticated by immigration officials, protecting the passport from forgery and potential fraudulent activities such as fake passports, while confirming its authenticity at border controls.
The cost of an e-passport is expected to be the same as an ordinary Indian passport.

Addressing a meeting here on Tuesday, the DC asked the police to register drug-related cases “instantly.”

Informing that the state government has issued instruction to “locate government officials who are involved in drug addiction and to give them one chance of rehabilitation,” the DC urged all departments to “locate such addicts in their respective department.”


ADC Liyi Bagra stressed on “exemplary punishment as per NDPS Act to abusers and traffickers; awareness camps with fund drives, and parental roles and societal efforts to control the menace,” while SP Raja Banthia said that the administration and the police alone cannot solve the issue “unless civil society as a whole comes forward to fight this menace.”

He added that the police would keep the names of informants secret while filing FIRs in drug-related cases.

DMO Dr Dubom Bagra, APWWS member Marbom Riba Bagra, and the principal of the government higher secondary school also spoke.

Indian Express,2/20/0627,"Rajnath for roadmap on de-escalation, border demarcation","Eight months after the disengagement of troops at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has told his Chinese counterpart Admiral Dong Jun that there is need for a “structured roadmap of permanent engagement and de-escalation”. He called for a “permanent solution of border demarcation”.
In his talks Thursday with Dong on the sidelines of the meeting of Defence Ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in Qingdao, Singh underlined the need for “bridging the trust deficit created after the 2020 border standoff, by taking action on ground”.
The Ministry of Defence, in a statement Friday, said Singh and Dong agreed to continue consultations at various levels to achieve progress on issues related to “disengagement, de-escalation, border management and eventual de-limitation through existing mechanisms”.
Even after the disengagement along the LAC in eastern Ladakh, de-escalation has not  happened. An estimated 50,000-60,000 troops are still stationed on either side of the LAC in the region.
The mention of a “structured roadmap” for permanent engagement and de-escalation is a new formulation – both sides have been working towards normalising their relationship after the bitter military standoff.
The previous meetings between the two sides had focused on trust, understanding and confidence-building through engagements and maintaining peace and tranquility along the borders. But there was no talk of a “structured roadmap”, key to the remaining steps for “de-escalation”.
The statement on the Qingdao meeting did not mention “de-induction” of troops while speaking on “border management” and “eventual de-limitation”.
The Ministry said the two ministers held “in-depth discussions on the need to maintain peace and tranquility” along the border.
It said Singh “acknowledged the work being undertaken by both sides to bring back semblance of normalcy in the bilateral relations” – the resumption of the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra is a pointer to that.
Singh, in a post on X, said, “Held talks with Admiral Dong Jun, the Defence Minister of China, on the sidelines of SCO Defence Ministers’ Meeting in Qingdao. We had a constructive and forward looking exchange of views on issues pertaining to bilateral relations.”
“Expressed my happiness at the restarting of the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra after a gap of nearly six years. It is incumbent on both sides to maintain this positive momentum and avoid adding new complexities in the bilateral relationship.”
According to the Ministry, Singh “highlighted the necessity of solving the complex issues through a structured roadmap of permanent engagement and de-escalation.”
He “also stressed on border management and to have a permanent solution of border demarcation by rejuvenating the established mechanism on the issue”, it said.
“He emphasised the need to create good neighbourly conditions to achieve best mutual benefits as well as to cooperate for stability in Asia and the world","In his talks Thursday with Dong on the sidelines of the meeting of Defence Ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in Qingdao, Singh underlined the need for “bridging the trust deficit created after the 2020 border standoff, by taking action on ground”.

Indian Express,2/20/0627,‘Given Rs 600 to split between 8 people’: Jharkhand men stranded in UAE with no pay for 3 months’,"For Charuman Mahto, the last few weeks have been trying. The company that they are employed with in the United Arab Emirates hasn’t paid him in weeks, he doesn’t have enough money to afford food and rent and now, he faces the additional threat of homelessness after their landlord has threatened to throw them out.
Charuman is among 15 migrant workers from Jharkhand’s Hazaribagh and Giridih districts who have been left stranded in Hamim in the outskirts of UAE’s Abu Dhabi after their Hyderabad-based utility company stopped paying them three months ago. With no money for rent, utilities or even food, the workers, who were hired to lay transmission lines, have now appealed to the central and state governments here to help them return home.
The group went to Abu Dhabi’s in January 2024. “While hiring us two years ago, the contractor, Tirupati Reddy, told us that the company has been working there for over 10 years and is trustworthy,” Charuman, who’s previously worked in construction in Kazakhstan, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia, said. “The contractor promised to pay us around 1,700 dirhams (approximately Rs 40,000) a month, and we were issued visas and told to pay for flight tickets. We weren’t required to pay for rent or electricity, which the company took care of. However, for the past three months, we haven’t received any pay.”
Calls and texts to contractor Tirupati Reddy and the company’s supervisor went unanswered.
With the company not paying for rent and utilities, their landlord has cut their water connection and has threatened to evict them from the two-room house they share in Hamim, the workers claim.
“This is the only work we know,” Arjun Mahto, a 28-year-old Bishnugarh, said. “But these past three months have been extremely difficult. Sometimes, the contractor would give us Rs 600 to divide between eight people. And now the landlord’s ultimatum. We even begged him to let us stay a little longer.”
“The heat here is unbearable. We won’t be able to live outdoors once we’re forced to leave. Our families back home are worried and are waiting for us to return,” another worker, 40-year-old Bishnu Mahto, said, adding: “Some Bangladeshi workers are helping us in whatever way they can.”
The workers eventually got in touch with Sikandar Ali, a migrant rights activist.  “We are constantly following up with the authorities and will continue to urge the government to take immediate action. Everyone is trying to help in their capacity — sending letters, giving updates to the families,” Ali said.
Shikha Lakra, head of the Jharkhand’s State Migrant Control Room (SMCR) – the migrant helpline under the state’s department of labour — said the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) had asked them to look into the issue “urgently”.
“We are working to bring the workers back safely in coordination with the Ministry of External Affairs and the Indian Embassy in Dubai,” she said.

Indian Express,2/20/0627,Bhopal’s 90-degree bridge: CM promises action against those responsible for ‘technical faults’,"Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Mohan Yadav on Thursday said action would be taken against those responsible for technical flaws in the construction of the railway overbridge in Bhopal that features a 90-degree turn.
Yadav said the overbridge would be inaugurated only after the flaws are fixed. “The technical faults in the construction work of the Aishbagh RoB will be rectified. People responsible for them will be identified and action will be taken against them,” he said, adding that the work to fix the issue has started.
The 648-metre bridge in the Aishbagh area, which cost Rs 18 crore to build, was meant to eliminate long delays at railway crossings and shorten the commute for nearly three lakh people daily. While one portion was being built by the Public Works Department, the Railways handled another portion.
The Public Works Department has constituted a four-member committee, including two chief engineers and an executive engineer, to assess the design, evaluate accountability, and recommend corrective measures.
The Indian Express had reported earlier this week that more than a year before the overbridge came up, red flags had already been raised over its peculiar design.
The report had said that on April 4, 2024, a team of supervisors from the Railways inspected the site where the bridge was being built, after which Sudhanshu Nagayach, Deputy Civil Engineer at the West Central Railways Division, wrote to the PWD Executive Engineer of the Bridge Construction Division that “during the inspection, it is noticed that towards Barkhedi, connection of bridge and approach (sic)” does not seem to be proper.
Nagayach wrote that the portions of the bridge constructed by the PWD and Railways are “meeting almost at right angle, which is neither fulfilling the functional requirement nor safe for road users”.
“It will lead to criticism amongst road users and public and also give bad image of engineers in the public,” the letter read.

Siddharth noted in his letter to district education officers, “Teachers have been transferred in various phases, but despite being posted at a distance of 30 km from a distance of 400 km, they are not satisfied, so complaints are being lodged at various levels.”
The order also highlights that academic work is being affected in schools where transferred teachers have not yet been replaced.
Under the new system, teachers can log in to the portal, view lists of transfer-seeking colleagues by district, subject, and category and apply for transfers themselves. The directive states that teachers of the same category and subject may form groups of up to ten and arrange mutual transfers between their current schools. The department says this will help “fill vacant posts and allow teachers to select the school themselves by transferring themselves.”
Verification for the transfer process will be conducted via OTP and transfer orders are to be issued within three days of application. The order makes clear that “it will be mandatory to join the selected school within seven days of the transfer order being issued. If even a single teacher in the entire group refuses to join, the transfer order of all the transferred teachers will be cancelled.”
The facility will be available from July 10 through the end of the month, with further guidelines to be issued separately, the directive reads. The Education Department has clarified that neither the state headquarters nor district establishment committees will intervene in the process, placing responsibility for transfers directly on teachers.
The initiative follows a large-scale transfer drive earlier this year involving more than 1,30,000 teachers. Despite the government’s efforts to make the process transparent and efficient, many teachers remained dissatisfied with their postings, prompting the department to introduce this self-transfer mechanism.
The officer said the new system is expected to provide convenience to teachers and help the department address the challenge of vacant posts in schools.

Indian Express,2/20/0626,"‘Learning like a baby, new steps, how to eat’: Shubhanshu Shukla, first Indian on board the ISS","With open arms, a beaming Shubhanshu Shukla glided into the International Space Station Thursday evening India time, transferring himself from the Dragon spacecraft that brought him and three others from Earth after a 28-hour journey through space.
Group Captain Shukla, the pilot of the Dragon spacecraft, is the first Indian on board the ISS. He was the second to enter the station, after mission commander Peggy Whitson of the US, shortly after 5.45 pm.
The Dragon had connected with the ISS, a permanent research laboratory in space, 105 minutes earlier in a smooth docking manoeuvre. At the time of docking, both the ISS and the spacecraft were travelling at speeds of nearly 26,500 km an hour.
The incoming astronauts — Whitson, Shukla, Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski of Poland and Tibor Kapu of Hungary — were welcomed with hugs by the astronauts already stationed there. The ISS was already home to seven astronauts, members of the 73rd expedition to the station that began on April 19 and will continue until November.
With the addition of four astronauts from the Axiom-4 mission, who will stay there for two weeks, ISS is now hosting 11 people. Operational since 1998, the ISS is comparable to a six-bedroom US apartment in size and can comfortably accommodate a dozen astronauts simultaneously.
Shukla and the other incoming astronauts were offered a liquid diet to refresh themselves as they chatted with the existing residents and moved around in the facility. For Whitson, a veteran of space travel, this is the fifth trip to the ISS.
Shortly thereafter, Shukla was presented with the astronaut number 634 by Whitson — he is the 634th individual who has travelled to space.
“It’s a privilege. It’s a privilege to be amongst the few who have got the chance to see the Earth from a vantage point,” Shukla said. “It has been a wonderful ride. It has been great. I was looking forward to coming to space. It is something to look forward to,” he said.
As the pilot of the mission, Shukla was given a number ahead of Uznanski-Wisniewski and Kapu. Whitson already has a number, 419.
“The best part about being commander with all rookies is that you get to watch the rookies go through it for the first time. And it helps you remember some of the things you went through the first time. It’s very special to relive the experience through these guys,” Whitson, whose first space trip was in 2002, said.
Shukla said he was overwhelmed by the welcome received from those on board the ISS.
“The minute I entered the International Space Station, you guys (members of the 73rd expedition) made us feel so welcome… you literally opened your doors for us. It was fantastic. I feel even better… Whatever expectations I had about coming here have been surpassed, by the view, of course that’s a big part of it, but by you guys as well. Thank you so much,” he said.
The Axiom-4 mission had launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida Wednesday noon India time, and took 28 hours ","Group Captain Shukla, the pilot of the Dragon spacecraft, is the first Indian on board the ISS. It’s a privilege to be amongst the few who have got the chance to see the Earth from a vantage point,” Shukla said. I am getting used to this quite well, enjoying the views, enjoying the entire experience, learning like a baby… learning the new steps, learning how to walk, learning how to control yourself, everything, learning how to eat,” he said. The Dragon spacecraft carrying the astronauts came in contact with the docking port of the Harmony module of the ISS for a ‘soft capture’ around 4 pm India time. Shubhanshu stands at the threshold entrance of the International Space Station … waiting to step in for a 14-day sojourn… as the world watches with excitement and expectation.” Anonna Dutt is a Principal Correspondent who writes primarily on health at the Indian Express.",International News

Indian Express,2/20/0626,Those who committed wrongs in Jal Jeevan Mission work won’t be spared: Minister C R Patil,"Asserting that any contractor or anyone who had committed wrongs in implementation of Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) will not be spared, Jal Shakti Minister C R Patil said Thursday that 92 per cent of teams of Central Nodal Officers deputed for “ground inspection” of the rural tap water schemes have submitted their reports and the remaining are expected to do so by end of this month.
Addressing a press conference on achievements of his ministry on completion of the NDA government’s 11 years, Patil said, “Out of 119 teams constituted, 111 teams have completed their survey work. 89 of them have submitted their reports and work is going on the same. I think that the remaining teams are expected to submit their resorts by 30 [June]. Out of the total teams deployed, 92 per cent have submitted their reports, only 8 per cent are yet to do so.”
Patil said that anyone who has committed any wrong will not be spared.
“hamne pahle Lok Sabha me bhi kaha tha, aap ko bhi batata hun… ye jo nal se jal ki yojana hai vah samanya aadmi ke ghar me paani dene ki baat hai. (I have said in Lok Sabha before and I reiterate it now. The tap water scheme is aimed at providing drinking water to the common man’s house. If any contractor or anyone else commits any wrong, we will not spare anyone),” Patil said, responding to a question.
Patil said that he had made it clear and this is the reason that the government had deployed over 100 teams of Central Nodal Officers for ground inspection of the JJM schemes. On May 19, the Centre had announced sending 100 teams for “ground inspection” of the Jal Jeevan Mission schemes across the country. The move follows a meeting chaired by the Cabinet Secretary on May 8 to review the mission’s schemes. Later, some more teams were added to the initial list of the teams.
Patil said that the states have also been told that there should not be any complaints where tap is installed but no water is available. It has been conveyed to the state governments that if the source of water has dried, it must create another source with their own money and ensure supply of water, he said.
Patil’s remarks are significant in view of ongoing scrutiny of the JJM amid concerns over rising costs. Since the launch of the Jal Jeevan Mission in 2019, 6.4 lakh water supply schemes with total estimated cost of Rs 8.29 lakh crore—more than double of the scheme’s original outlay of Rs 3.60 lakh crore (Centre: Rs 2.08 lakh crore, States:1.52 lakh crore) — have been approved by the states.
On May 21, The Indian Express reported that an investigation of the data uploaded by states and UTs on the Jal Jeevan Mission dashboard showed that a crucial change in tender guidelines three years ago lifted the check on expenditure, and led to cost escalations. This resulted in additional costs totalling Rs 16,839 crore for 14,586 schemes, an increase of 14.58% from their estimated cost.

Indian Express,2/20/0626,"Need to discuss if socialist, secular should remain in Preamble: RSS Gen Secy Dattatreya Hosabale","RSS general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale on Thursday not only asked the Congress to apologise to the country for imposing the Emergency but also made a strong pitch for a discussion on whether the words “socialist” and “secular”, inserted in the Preamble of the Constitution during the Emergency days, should continue to remain.
Addressing a gathering at Dr Ambedkar International Centre, Hosabale, while refraining from mentioning Congress, said, “Those who did this (imposed the Emergency) are moving around with the Constitution in their hands. They have not apologised to the country for that. They must apologise for it. If your ancestors did it, apologise on their behalf.”
Coming to the 42nd Constitutional Amendment in 1976 through which the words “socialist” and “secular” were included in the Preamble, Hosabale said, “The words socialist and secular were added to the Preamble. No attempt was made to remove them later. So, there should be a discussion on whether they should remain. I say this in a building (Ambedkar International Centre) named after Babasaheb Ambedkar, whose Constitution did not have these words in the Preamble.”
During the Lok Sabha elections, several INDIA bloc leaders, especially Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had waved a copy of the Constitution in various rallies, alleging that PM Narendra Modi-led government was “trying to change” it.
At the event, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari was the chief guest with journalist Ram Bahadur Rai and former BJP leader K N Govindacharya also on the panel since they had actively participated in the movement spearheaded by Jayaprakash Narayan leading up to the imposition of the Emergency in 1975.
It was necessary, Hosabale said, that the dates June 25 and June 26 do not remain “old boys’ clubs of discussions” among those who were thrown in jails during the 21 months of the Emergency but “occasions to spread information among the youth about that period, so that the Emergency mindset never returns in the country”. He called upon the Sangh’s student affiliate Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) to hold study circles in universities to spread awareness about the Emergency.
Hosabale said while thousands of people were put in jail and tortured during that period, freedom of the judiciary and media was also curtailed.

He recalled having seen Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L K Advani being arrested on the morning of June 26, 1975 just outside an MLA guest house in Bengaluru, where they were put up for a Parliamentary Committee meeting.
“Advani ji said he wants to call the PTI and UNI to give a statement, and Atal ji asked him who would be willing to publish it?” Hosabale recalled, but added that the people of India proved their maturity as a democracy in those testing times.
Gadkari also recalled that when he went to secure parole for his maternal uncle so that he could perform the last rites of his maternal grandfather, he had to wait outside the police station the whole night. He stressed that the stor","RSS general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale on Thursday not only asked the Congress to apologise to the country for imposing the Emergency but also made a strong pitch for a discussion on whether the words “socialist” and “secular”, inserted in the Preamble of the Constitution during the Emergency days, should continue to remain.

Yadav also chaired a meeting of the standing committee of the National Board for Wildlife in Dehradun and the committee recommended the inclusion of sloth bear and gharial in the ministry’s species recovery programme, the ministry added.
According to the ministry, during the meeting it was also noted that as part of the government’s plans to mitigate elephant mortalities due to collisions with trains, 3,452.4 km of sensitive railway stretches were surveyed and 77 high-risk areas were identified for mitigation.
Project Elephant is a centrally sponsored scheme and the steering committee reviews the project’s implementation and issues such as elephant conservation and protection of habitats.
On the synchronized elephant population estimation in the Northeastern states, the committee noted that over 16,500 elephant dung samples have been collected, as per the ministry. Further, the committee also discussed regional action plans on human-elephant conflict in southern and Northeastern India.
The last elephant census or estimation exercise was in 2017 which found that the country was home to around 29,964 elephants. Even though a report on the next synchronized elephant census titled ‘Status of Elephants in India 2022-23’ was prepared, The Indian Express had reported last October that it was shelved citing a delay in census in the North-East and because it was an interim report. That report had noted a 20% drop in elephant count compared to five years ago.
Last December, in reply to a question in Parliament, the Environment ministry had said that between 2019-20 and 2023-24, 73 elephant deaths due to collision with trains or train accidents were reported.
The committee also noted progress on DNA profiling of captive elephants, with 1,911 genetic profiles completed across 22 states.
Yadav urged coordinated efforts between Indian Railways, Ministry of Power, NHAI and mine developers to reduce human-wildlife conflict, as per a government release. He also emphasised the need for systematic collection and analysis of data on elephant deaths due to railway accidents, and knowledge sharing among states.

Indian Express,2/20/0626,India in touch with China on rare earth supply issue amid export curbs: MEA,"India on Thursday said it has been in touch with China on the issue of rare earth magnet supply, as Beijing has imposed restrictions on their exports.
This is the first time that the Indian government has officially acknowledged raising the matter with China, at a time when Delhi and Beijing are working towards normalising the relationship after six years of border standoff.
Responding to questions, MEA official spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “On rare earths, yes, we have been in touch with the Chinese side both in Delhi as also in Beijing and we are talking to them as to how we can streamline the supply chain issue on rare earths.”
“We are in touch with the Chinese side on several economic issues and trade issues as and when anything is required to be done,” he said.
China, which controls over 90% of global processing capacity for the magnets used for automobiles, clean energy and home appliances, enacted restrictions in April requiring companies to obtain import permits from Beijing.
China’s export curbs — meant as a response to US President Donald Trump’s tariffs — is likely to impact car manufacturers worldwide.
The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), an industry group, has sought the Indian government’s intervention.
While rare earth magnets are a crucial component in electric vehicle motors, they are also required for parts like power windows and audio speakers used in petrol or diesel-run cars.
And though the measures imposed by Beijing are meant to focus on high-performance exports, shipments of low-end magnets are also being held up at ports due to confusion around implementing the restrictions.
India’s auto sector imported 460 tons of rare earth magnets, mostly from China, in the fiscal year ending March 31 and expects to import 700 tons worth $30 million this year, according to industry estimates.
Sources said that the industry bodies and companies had raised the issue with the commerce ministry, and that had been escalated to the Chinese.
On April 2, Trump unveiled his policy of reciprocal tariffs, targeting most of America’s trading partners. Two days later, China responded by announcing a 34% tariff on all US imports, while also placing export restrictions on rare earths.
Following the restrictions in April, China’s exports of rare earth magnets fell sharply in May. The framework agreed to by the US and China also involves the easing of rare earth supplies.
Critical minerals and rare earth elements, which are used across several key sectors, ranging from electronics to renewables, automobiles and defence, are increasingly playing a vital role in the economy. For instance, lithium, nickel and cobalt are used in lithium-ion batteries. Dysprosium and neodymium, and tellurium, indium, and gallium are used in wind turbines and photovoltaic cells respectively.

Jaishankar has responded to the US proposal to impose a 500% tariff on Russian oil imports, saying that any development in the US Congress is of interest to India if it affects, or has the potential to affect, the country’s interests.
Addressing a press conference, Jaishankar said that India’s concerns and interests regarding energy security have been conveyed to US Senator Lindsey Graham.

“Regarding Senator Lindsey Graham's bill, any development which is happening in the US Congress is of interest to us if it impacts our interest or could impact our interest. So, we have been in touch with Senator Graham. The embassy and, ambassador have been in touch. Our concerns and our interests in energy, security have been made conversant to him. So, we'll then have to cross that bridge when we come to it, if we come to it,” Jaishankar said.
Graham's sanctions bill on Russia would impose a 500 per cent tariff on imports from any nation that purchases Russian oil, gas, uranium and other products, The Hill reported. The bill has over 80 co-sponsors in the Senate, potentially making it veto-proof.
Following the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war, the US and other Western nations imposed sanctions on Moscow, but India has maintained its imports of Russian oil.

Mint,2/20/0703,Who is Soham Parekh? Indian techie accused of moonlighting across multiple US startups,"An Indian tech professional named Soham Parekh is at the centre of a growing controversy in Silicon Valley after he was accused of moonlighting at multiple US-based startups, without disclosing his parallel roles.
The allegation was made public by Suhail Doshi, co-founder and former CEO of analytics platform Mixpanel. Taking to X (formerly Twitter), Doshi claimed that Parekh had been secretly working for three to four startups simultaneously, deceiving early-stage companies, including several backed by Y Combinator.
“He’s been preying on YC companies and more. Beware,” Doshi wrote, while publicly sharing Parekh’s CV and suggesting his work portfolio may be fabricated.
In a follow-up post, Doshi revealed that he had attempted to reason with Parekh before exposing him online.
“I tried to talk sense into this guy, explain the impact, and give him a chance to turn a new leaf… but it clearly didn’t work,” he said.
Responding to users questioning why moonlighting is unethical if performance targets are met, Doshi asserted that Parekh “got nothing done” during his short stint at Mixpanel and that he frequently lied about his work.
“It wasn’t just moonlighting. It was lying, faking progress, and deceiving multiple employers at once,” Doshi wrote.
According to the CV shared by Doshi, Soham Parekh holds a bachelor’s degree from the University of Mumbai and a master’s from Georgia Institute of Technology. His resume lists stints at several tech firms, including Dynamo AI, Union AI, Synthesia, and Alan AI — mostly in engineering and technical roles.
Reacting to the viral post, Soham Parekh wrote, ""There’s a lot being said about me right now, and most of you don’t know the full story. If there’s one thing to know about me, it’s that I love to build. That’s it. I’ve been isolated, written off, and shut out by nearly everyone I’ve known and every company I’ve worked at. But building is the only thing I’ve ever truly known, and it’s what I’ll keep doing.""
He revealed that he has signed an exclusive founding deal to be founding engineer at one company and one company only. ""They were the only ones willing to bet on me at this time. The team is cracked, they back misfits, and they’re building something absolutely insane in the video AI space.
We’re launching at the end of this month. More details tomorrow in my TBPN interview. I’m pissed. And I’ve got something to prove.""

Mint,2/20/0703,"Shocking: Company distributes employees’ nude photos, sexually abuses them as punishment for not meeting sales targets","Neo Corporation is facing public outrage after reports of shocking punishments for staff who didn’t meet sales targets. The punishments the underperformers allegedly received are shocking, to say the least.
The Japanese company, based in Osaka, sells and installs electricity and energy-saving products. It has nine branches in Japan and claims high salaries in its job ads.
According to the company, the average annual income for sales staff in 2024 was $97,000 ( ₹83 lakh). It also claims that 57.1 per cent of its salespeople earn $69,500 (nearly  ₹60 lakh a year).
However, what has shocked social media is how the company allegedly treats its employees.
Former employees said underperformers were forced to take nude photos. They were sexually abused by the boss, who allegedly grabbed the underperformers’ private parts, according to the South China Morning Post.
Five ex-workers filed a lawsuit in March. They accused the company of verbal abuse and harassment. One worker said, if someone failed to make a sale, the manager forced them to take nude photos. Then, he shared them with others and sent the victim proof.
According to one employee, his boss often punished him by painfully grabbing his private parts. When he complained, the manager laughed and said it happened to everyone. The worker later developed depression.
Reports also reveal verbal abuse, forced unpaid overtime and even slapping by senior staff. The company deducted sales commissions unfairly and sometimes made employees return money on payday.
Harsh fines were also imposed for things like traffic violations, some as high as $42,000 ( ₹36 lakh). In March, five ex-employees filed a lawsuit, demanding $132,000 ( ₹1.13 crore) in damages for mental harassment and illegal pay cuts.
The incident has shocked many. It has raised serious concerns about workplace abuse in Japan’s corporate sector.
One person called it “more than workplace harassment”, according to SCMP. Another said asking for and sharing private photos is a crime.
“We thought television dramas were exaggerated, but reality is even more terrifying,” came from another.
Neo Corporation has, however, denied all the allegations and emphasised its anti-harassment policy.
“Harassment has no place in our corporate culture. There are also factual errors based on one-sided perspectives,” SCMP quoted the company as stating.

Mint,2/20/0703,Delhi HC restrains Baba Ramdev's Patanjali from running misleading ad against Dabur Chyawanprash,"The Delhi High Court on Thursday restrained Patanjali from running allegedly disparaging advertisements against Dabur Chyawanprash.
A bench of Justice Mini Pushkarna allowed interim injunction applications filed by Dabur, saying, ‘Application is allowed’. The court has now listed the matter for further hearing on July 14.
The controversy started after Patanjali aired an advertisement starring Baba Ramdev, where he is seen questioning the authenticity of other Chyawanprash products in the market.
The advertisement states:“Jinko Ayurved aur Vedo ka gyaan nahi, Charak, Sushrut, Dhanwantari aur Chyawanrishi ke parampara mei ‘original’ Chyawanprash kaise bana payenge?”
Dabur also objected to certain parts of Patanjali's ads that described a 40-herb Chyawanprash as “ordinary.”

Dabur said that “40+ herbs” tag is a direct reference to Dabur’s product, which holds over 60% of the Chyawanprash market.
Dabur further stated that the advertisement was misleading and undermines consumer trust in a product category that is strictly regulated. It argued that Chyawanprash is a classical Ayurvedic formulation governed by the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, , which mandates adherence to prescribed formulations based on ancient Ayurvedic texts.
To label other brands as “ordinary” is both misleading and harmful, Dabur contended.
The company further raised concerns that the advertisement implied potential health hazards from using non-Patanjali products, posing a threat to public safety. It cited to earlier Supreme Court orders in contempt proceedings against Patanjali for similar advertising conduct, arguing that the company is a habitual offender.
Dabur India owns brands such as Dabur Amla, Dabur Vatika, Dabur Chyawanprash, Dabur Honey, Honitus, PudinHara and Dabur Lal Tail and juice brand Real.
Dabur India reported an 8.35 per cent decline in consolidated net profit at  ₹312.73 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2025 impacted by higher expenses in a challenging demand environment.
The company had posted a profit of  ₹341.22 crore in the same quarter previous fiscal, Dabur India said in a regulatory filing.
Revenue from operations in the quarter under review stood at  ₹2,830.14 crore as against  ₹2,814.64 crore in the year-ago period, it added.

They argue that the laws were imposed undemocratically, and without repeal, no constructive discussion can take place.

AIKSCC highlighted issues such as paddy being sold at ₹900 per quintal against an MSP of ₹1,868, worsened by the FPTC Act 2020.

The Samyukta Kisan Morcha supported ongoing protests, urging citizens to boycott corporate products and encouraged student groups and workers to mobilize locally.

Mint,2/20/0703,HDFC Bank CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan moves SC against Lilavati Trust FIR after recusal of Bombay HC judges,"HDFC Bank CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan has filed a petition with the Supreme Court of India against the FIR by Lilavati Kirtilal Mehta Medical Trust, according to a LiveLaw report.
This comes after recusals by three Bombay High Court judges in the case, which Senior Advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Jagdishan, told the apex court bench had caused a delay, the report added.
The SC bench of Justices MM Sundresh and K Vinod Chandran, has agreed to list the matter tomorrow, July 4 (Friday), as per the report.
Rohatgi called Lilavati Trust's FIR “frivolous” adding that the bank has to recover money from them and this is a way for them to allegedly arm-twist out of paying.
“A frivolous FIR has been lodged against the MD and the Bank, by trustees of the Lilavati hospital, who are litigating against the other group of trustees. The bank has to recover money from them. In order to twist the arm, they have lodged an FIR through the Magistrate against the MD. We went to the Bombay High Court. Three benches of the Bombay High Court recused from hearing. Now the next date is given as July 14, that is also tentative. Everyday the bank is suffering,” Rohatgi submitted, as per the report.
Notably, three judges in the Bombay HC have recused from the case in three separate instances. Further, as per the High Court's earlier administrative order, cases related to Lilavati Trust are not be listed before six other of its judges, the LiveLaw report added.

Mint,2/20/0703,"UP Kabaddi player Brijesh Solanki, 22, dies of rabies weeks after puppy bite","In a deeply tragic case, 22-year-old Kabaddi player Brijesh Solanki from Uttar Pradesh died of rabies, weeks after being bitten by a stray puppy he had rescued from a drain. A promising state-level athlete and gold medallist, Brijesh was being groomed for the Pro Kabaddi League. His death has sparked shock and concern across social media and raised urgent questions about awareness around rabies prevention.
According to a Times of India report, Brijesh did not take the anti-rabies vaccine after the minor bite, believing it to be harmless. His family said he did not realise the seriousness of the injury and mistook the early symptoms for a routine sports injury.
“He pulled a puppy out of a drain and it bit him lightly. He didn’t think it was serious,” said his brother, Sandeep Kumar, speaking to news agency ANI. “We had never even heard of a rabies case. By the time symptoms appeared, it was too late.”
The first signs of illness appeared on June 26, when Brijesh began feeling numbness during practice. His condition quickly worsened. He was taken to a district hospital and then shifted to a private facility in Noida. But as his condition deteriorated, he reportedly developed hydrophobia — a classic symptom of rabies.
“He became scared of water, and only then did doctors suspect it was rabies,” said Sandeep. “We were denied proper treatment at several government hospitals. By the time we reached Noida, it was already too late.”
Brijesh passed away on Saturday, en route to a faith healer in Mathura. A heartbreaking video of the young athlete in a delirious state circulated online a day after his death, leaving many questioning the lack of public health awareness and access to timely treatment.
Following his death, health officials visited Farana village and vaccinated at least 29 people as a precaution. A local awareness drive has also been launched.
“He was our most promising player,” said Praveen Kumar, Brijesh’s coach. “He thought the pain in his arm was from regular kabaddi practice. He didn’t realise how serious that small bite could be.”
The family has now appealed to the government for support. “Brijesh was the sole breadwinner. We request that the government give us a job to help us survive,” Sandeep added.

Mint,2/20/0703,India‑US ‘mini trade deal’ in 48 hours? Can the two nations reach a common ground before July 9 tariff deadline?,"India and the United States will likely finalise an interim or a “mini trade deal” within the next 48 hours, with negotiations underway in Washington, DC, news reports said on 3 July, quoting sources.
The discussions between the Indian and US trade teams are in their ‘last leg’, with the Indian team extending its stay in Washington last week to sort out differences. The two countries expect to arrive at a mini deal before 9 July, the day the pause on US tariffs is set to be lifted.
“Both sides have dug in their heels over a number of issues, including Washington's demand that India open its market to genetically modified crops - a long-standing red line for New Delhi due to risks to its farmers,” NDTV said in a report saying that the “mini trade deal” would be finalised within 48 hours.
The reports said the US wants greater market access to the Indian agricultural and dairy sectors. However, these sectors are likely to be excluded from the proposed deal due to concerns over rural livelihoods and food safety.
India, for its part, wants tariff concessions on its labour-intensive exports, such as footwear, garments and leather, which create major jobs.
A report in News18 said India has made it clear that it cannot completely open up its dairy sector, which serves as the economic backbone for millions of Indian farmers.
External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had earlier expressed hope that trade negotiations between India and the US would reach a ‘successful conclusion’ and that the two nations could find a ‘meeting ground’.
President Donald Trump also expressed optimism about finalising a trade agreement with India that could lead to significantly lower tariffs for American goods, provided New Delhi takes steps to ease market access for US companies.
Trump had earlier said that India appeared willing to reduce trade barriers, potentially clearing the path for an agreement ahead of a looming 9 July tariff deadline.
“Right now, India doesn’t accept anybody in. I think India is going to do that. If they do, we’re going to have a deal for less, much less, tariffs,” Trump said, referring to the 26 per cent reciprocal tariffs he announced on 2 April, which are currently suspended pending trade negotiations.
The focus of the deal, however, has narrowed to reciprocal tariff reductions or removals, as officials have called on both nations to prioritise lowering overall duty barriers, NDTV reported.
India and the US have been negotiating over a Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) before the deadline for the suspended 26 per cent reciprocal tariffs is lifted.
These reciprocal tariffs on India imposed by the Trump administration on 2 April were temporarily suspended for 90 days but will automatically resume if no agreement is reached.

It is alleged that Mishra, an alumnus, raped the first-year student inside a security guard's room in South Calcutta Law College on 25 June evening while Ahmed and Mukherjee, her seniors in the institute, helped him.
“Their mobile phone location showed them moving around Ballygunge Station Road and Fern Place on the evening of 26 June. The mobile tower dump is being used for the purpose,” the officer said.

“The movement of the accused three is very important for the sake of the investigation. We are analysing the call detail records; we need to know the purpose of these meetings, which could have links to the case,” he said.
According to the detectives, the trio were giving contradictory statements to mislead the police.
“Because these three are law students, they know certain tricks. They are giving out contradictory statements to confuse us,” he said.
According to a report by the Times of India, Monojit told police he was “confident” the survivor would not report the crime, believing that the video of the assault on their phones would serve as a deterrent.

Mint,2/20/0703,Trump warns Republicans as GOP struggles to get final votes for Tax Bill: ‘Ridiculous…what are you waiting for’,"As House Republican leaders struggle to find the final votes to advance Donald Trump’s massive tax and spending package, the president voiced frustration, saying, “What are Republicans waiting for and what are they trying to prove?”
Trump on Thursday posted on Truth Social, “Largest Tax Cuts in History and a Booming Economy vs. Biggest Tax Increase in History, and a Failed Economy. What are the Republicans waiting for??? What are you trying to prove??? MAGA IS NOT HAPPY, AND IT’S COSTING YOU VOTES!!!”
In another post, he said, “FOR REPUBLICANS, THIS SHOULD BE AN EASY YES VOTE. RIDICULOUS!!!”
 
Trump had set an ambitious plan to get the fiscal package passed by July 4. However, even with the Republicans controlling both the House and Senate, he faced pushback. Both cost-conscious conservatives as well as swing-district moderates are worried that the plan would make big cuts to Medicaid and other social welfare programmes.
On a key procedural vote late Wednesday, five “no” votes appeared on the board from Republicans, while eight others held back their votes. And that is enough to set back the measure.
Speaker Mike Johnson, meanwhile, said he would keep pressing through the night to advance the tax bill.
“I’ll keep it open for as long as it takes to make sure we’ve got everybody here accounted for and all the questions answered,” Johnson said in an interview on Fox News.
The House was voting on the rules for discussing a tax bill—a step that usually follows party lines and is considered routine. But in a closely divided House, such votes can become a way for lawmakers to show their power and push for changes or demands.
Trump and Johnson had projected confidence ahead of the critical procedural vote. As voting began, the speaker told reporters that “we’re in a good place,” adding that “we’re going to deliver the big beautiful bill.”
“It looks like the House is ready to vote tonight,” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social social media platform.
“We had GREAT conversations all day, and the Republican House Majority is UNITED, for the Good of our Country, delivering the Biggest Tax Cuts in History and MASSIVE Growth,” President Trump said.
Earlier in the day, Johnson sounded hopeful that enough Republican lawmakers would eventually support the bill, which includes tax cuts the party had promised, roll back clean energy incentives from the Biden era, and provide funding for Trump’s push to curb illegal immigration.

Mint,2/20/0703,Boeing  AH-64E Apache: What India’s upcoming US-made attack choppers can do – explained,"India is likely to receive three of the six AH-64E Apache attack helicopters ordered for the Army by the end of this month, after a delay of about 15 months, media reports said.
The development comes after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, in a telephone call with US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth, sought fast-tracking deliveries of the combat helicopters and GE F404 engines that will power India’s LCA Tejas, the Indian Express said in a report.
India and the United States signed a $600 million deal to procure six additional Apache helicopters for the Army in 2020, following a contract to procure 22 helicopters for the Indian Air Force in 2015. 
The six Apache helicopters were supposed to be delivered in three batches in May–June 2024. The delay in delivery was attributed to technical and supply chain issues.
News reports said these six new Apache AH-64E helicopters will be based at Jodhpur in Rajasthan and deployed along the western borders with Pakistan. The Apache squadron in Jodhpur was established in 2024 by the Army Aviation Corps. The Squadron has been waiting for helicopters for over 15 months now.
The Apache AH-64E is recognised as one of the most advanced and lethal multi-role attack helicopters in the world. Developed by Boeing, it features a combination of firepower, agility and cutting-edge technology.
“The AH-64E is the most modern configuration of the Apache and is ready for the multi-domain operation (MDO) battlefield. A network-centric, fully integrated weapon system specifically built to dominate in a highly contested and complex battle space, the AH-64E Version 6, or v6, Apache includes multiple enhancements to the aircraft’s sensors, software and weapons performance,” reads the Boeing website.
The helicopter is equipped with Hellfire missiles, 70mm rockets, and a 30mm chain gun, according to reports. It is capable of engaging ground targets, armoured vehicles, and even low-flying aircraft. 
Also, the advanced sensors, targeting radar, and night vision capabilities make it suitable for operations in all conditions, including high-altitude and low-visibility combat zones.
In addition to offensive roles, the Apache’s survivability features, including crash-resistant structures, redundant flight systems and infrared suppression, make it a highly reliable platform in modern warfare.
“The Modernised Apache builds on the mature, combat-proven AH-64 platform and combines it with the convergence of cutting-edge attack helicopter technologies to deliver greater reach, survivability and lethality. It represents the most affordable, achievable, low-risk attack helicopter for MDO decision dominance,” the Boeing website says.
Boeing’s AH-64E v6 is a fully integrated, optimised for battle attack helicopter that is truly in a class by itself, it says. It provides and integrates advanced capabilities through a layered effect of onboard and offboard sensors, stand-off long-range weapons and the connectivity required to use all the tools the ec","India and the United States signed a $600 million deal to procure six additional Apache helicopters for the Army in 2020, following a contract to procure 22 helicopters for the Indian Air Force in 2015. The AH-64E v6, also known as the Apache Guardian, is the latest and most advanced version of the Boeing AH-64 Apache attack helicopter. “Designed for interoperability within the MDO ecosystem, the AH-64E v6 is a lethal, survivable and agile system providing the reach, manoeuvrability and performance needed by ground forces and contributes to current and future joint mission success,” the website reads. Apart from India, the other customers for the Apache include Egypt, Greece, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Korea, Kuwait, the Netherlands, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom. This $1.9 billion award brought the total current funded value of the contract to $2.1 billion, and has the potential to increase to more than $3.8 billion with future obligations, the company had said in a press statement then.",International News
Mint,2/20/0703,Indian-origin entrepreneur Balaji Srinivasan buys private island to build new nation for techies,"Indian-origin tech entrepreneur Balaji Srinivasan has purchased a private island near Singapore to build what he calls a “Network State”- a decentralised, digital-first society for techies, creators, and founders.
Srinivasan, a former CTO of Coinbase and co-founder of multiple Silicon Valley ventures, envisions a future where online communities with shared values evolve into globally recognised nations. His project, which once sounded like a futuristic thought experiment, is now unfolding on a real island with real people, and it’s creating quite the buzz, TechCrunch reported.
The island is home to ‘The Network School’, a three-month residential programme that merges entrepreneurship, emerging tech, and personal transformation. Participants, handpicked for their ambition and unconventional thinking, wake up to gym sessions and spend the day attending workshops on artificial intelligence, blockchain, and startup innovation.
“We got an island. That’s right. Through the power of Bitcoin, we now have a beautiful island near Singapore where we’re building the Network School,” Srinivasan posted on X.
Srinivasan’s long-term goal? To build a borderless, crowd-funded nation for digital nomads and tech-savvy changemakers — a concept he outlined in his 2022 book The Network State. According to him, the idea is to create self-improving communities that first exist online, then claim physical territory, and eventually negotiate global recognition.
One participant, content creator Nick Peterson, shared a virtual tour of the island and described it as “an oasis for gym rats and startup founders.” He added, “I’ve been living in this real-life experiment called the Network School, where we are kind of testing what creating a new nation would feel like.”
Srinivasan says the school is designed to foster “win-and-help-win” societies focused on truth, health, and wealth. The island curriculum is deeply rooted in his broader mission to rethink governance in the digital age.
Born to Tamil-origin physician parents in New York, Balaji Srinivasan holds multiple degrees in Electrical and Chemical Engineering from Stanford University. Over the past two decades, he has co-founded and backed several high-profile tech ventures — including Counsyl, Earn.com, and Teleport — and invested early in Bitcoin, Ethereum, OpenSea, and Alchemy.
The 44-year-old is one of Silicon Valley’s more provocative thinkers, often stirring debate with his critiques of traditional institutions and his push for decentralised systems. Critics have likened his “network nation” idea to modern-day techno-utopianism, or even digital-age colonialism — but Srinivasan remains undeterred.
In 2024, he launched the first Network School on this Southeast Asian island, with future campuses planned for Dubai, Tokyo, and Miami.
“We’re looking for remote workers, digital creators, personal trainers, developers — people who want to earn crypto, build things, burn calories, and have fun,” he said in a recruitment post.","Indian-origin tech entrepreneur Balaji Srinivasan has purchased a private island near Singapore to build what he calls a “Network State”- a decentralised, digital-first society for techies, creators, and founders.

Mint,2/20/0703,"Phone-tapping violates right to privacy: Madras Court observes, ‘Can only be used for…’","Phone-tapping is a violation of the fundamental right to privacy unless it is justified by a procedure established by law, the Madras High Court observed on Wednesday.
Citing Section 5(2) of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, Justice N Anand Venkatesh stated that the law permits phone tapping in cases of a public emergency or in the interest of public safety, but it should not be misused to cover regular criminal investigations.
The Court observed, as quoted by Bar and Bench, ""The right to privacy is now an integral part of the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. Telephone tapping constitutes a violation of the right to privacy unless justified by a procedure established by law.""
It added, “Section 5(2) of the Act authorises interception of telephones on the occurrence of a public emergency or in the interests of public safety...the words of Section 5(2) of the Act cannot be strained to include detection of ordinary crime.”
The Court was hearing a plea challenging a 2011 order issued by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs authorising the CBI to tap the mobile phone of the petitioner P Kishore, who was then the Managing Director of Everonn Education Limited.
The order was linked to a CBI investigation based on an FIR filed in August 2011, which named Kishore as one of the accused. The FIR said an IRS officer named Andasu Ravinder, who was working as an Additional Commissioner of Income Tax, allegedly asked Kishore for a  ₹50 lakh bribe to help his company avoid paying taxes. The bribe was allegedly to be routed through Uttam Bohra, a friend of Ravinder.
Based on the tip-off, the CBI caught Ravinder and Bohra near Ravinder’s home with  ₹50 lakh, which they could not account for. 
Kishore later challenged the phone-tapping order, saying it violated his right to privacy. The Centre and CBI, however, argued that interception was necessary to prevent and investigate corruption.
The Court dismissed this argument, saying that interpreting the law so broadly would weaken the constitutional right to privacy.
""In fact, the use of Section 5(2) of the Act to detect the commission of ordinary crimes de-hors the requirement of public emergency or in the interests of public safety appears to be clearly misconceived.""
“Where phone tapping has been found necessary to tackle crimes, such a power has been expressly conferred as for example in certain special statutes like the Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act, 1999. Section 14 of the said Act authorizes interception of wire, electronic or oral communication for the purposes of investigating into organised crime. The words of Section 5(2) of the Act cannot be strained to include detection of ordinary crime.”

the tribune ,2005-06-01 00:00:00,Bofors bubble bursts HC quashes charges against Hinduja brothers and Swedish firm,"ew Delhi, May 31
In a major relief to Europe-based NRI Hinduja brothers, the Delhi High Court today quashed charges against them in the Rs 64 crore Bofors payoff case, while exonerating the Swedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors as well of the charges of criminal conspiracy and forgery, saying the agency had failed to produce original documents about the alleged nine payments to the brothers and the photo copies of those papers could not be relied upon as authentic evidence.

Lambasting the CBI for the manner in which it had probed the case during the past 14 years at an estimated cost of Rs 250 crore and not been able to procure even the crucial original documents from the Swedish authorities, Mr Justice R.S. Sodhi said. “During the investigation a huge bubble was created with the aid of the media, which, however, when tested by court, burst leaving behind a disastrous trail of suffering.”

“…on the basis of the statements made by the CBI in the court about the documents, no case can be proceeded with in respect of Hinduja brothers — Srichand, Gopichand, Prakashchand — or the Bofors company,” the court said, quashing the proceedings before the trial court against them and as well as the order of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate framing charges in the case. In a protracted legal battle, the three brothers had left no stone unturned to explore every possible legal remedy available to them in the case since the CBI had filed a chargesheet against them in October 2000.

With this order, the bail bonds and surety bonds executed by Hinduja brothers and the AB Bofors before the trial court also stood quashed, Justice Sodhi ruled. Coming down heavily on the CBI for failing to bring its investigation to a logical conclusion, the court said, “The accused suffered emotionally. Careers — both political and professional — were ruined besides causing a huge economic loss. Many an accused lived and died with a stigma. It is hoped that this elite investigating agency will be more responsible in future.”

Rejecting the photostat copies of the original documents, sent by the Swedish Government’s Prosecutor’s Office via their Ministry of Justice to the CBI through Indian Embassy during the protracted investigation in the highly politically sensitive case, the court said on the basis of such documents the alleged nine payments estimated to be over 14 crore, received by Hinduja brothers’ company Mcintyre Corporation, could not be linked to the Bofors gun deal.

The CBI had alleged that Hinduja brothers who acted as middlemen in the Rs 1437 crore Bofors gun deal, signed in 1986 by the then Rajiv Gandhi Government with Swedish arms manufacturer, were among the main beneficiary of the Rs 64 crore kickbacks along with Italian businessman Ottavio Quattarochhi, who is absconding. The court said that on the basis of two documents -D-292 and D-293 - exhibited by the CBI on record “show that the status of Hindujas was of consultants and not of agents.”

Holding that the duplicates of the original documents did not fulfil the test of Section 78(6) of the Evidence Act, which deals with foreign documents in a criminal case, the Court said that careful analysis of the CBI’s statement about the transmission of the documents, “Shows that the (Swedish) Prosecutor’s Office had in its possession photostat copies and it sent them to the Ministry of Justice, Sweden.”

The court said the document procurement process showed that only change that had taken place during the transmission of these papers to India was that “an initial and seal of the Ministry of Justice has been put thereon but no date.”

“Now under the Evidence Act, I cannot take judicial notice either of the seal or the initial. These too have to be proved by evidence. Moreover, what becomes crystal clear is that the Ministry of Justice has not issued any certified copy of the documents in their possession. There is no such certificate appended to the photo copies nor is there anything to show that the authority, which has put its seal and initials, had the originals in its possession and made the photo copies there from,” the court said.

Under Section 76 of the Evidence Act, a certified copy about the authenticity of duplicate documents when produced before the court in a case was required to be issued by the authority, which were issuing such documents, to be placed before a court of law, Justice Sodhi observed.

The CBI, meanwhile, said that it would examine the judgement and decide about the future course of action, when asked whether an appeal would be filed in the Supreme Court.","The Delhi High Court quashed charges against the Hinduja brothers and AB Bofors in the ₹64 crore Bofors payoff case, citing lack of original evidence. The court criticized the CBI for a flawed 14-year probe and emotional, political, and financial damage caused by the case, dismissing unreliable photocopied documents.",Crime and Justice
The tribune ,2005-06-02 00:00:00,Hurriyat leaders leave for PoK today Massive security cover,"Srinagar, June 1
All is set for the “Karvaan-e-Aman” that would be carrying over a dozen separatist leaders on their first ever visit to PoK and Pakistan when the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus rolls from here tomorrow morning. Those who got the travel permits include moderate APHC Chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, JKLF chairman Mohammad Yaseen Malik and Shabir Ahmad Shah of the Democratic Freedom Party (DFP), while the hardline Hurriyat chairman, Syed Ali Shah Geelani has opted out.

Meanwhile, a massive security blanket was thrown in the entire Kashmir valley following intelligence reports that militants are planning to strike in a big way.

The security along the entire route from Srinagar to the Kaman post has been upgraded keeping in view a high degree of threat perception.

Sharpshooters have taken positions at various points along the Jhelum valley road.

Official sources said intelligence reports had been received that militants are planning to strike in the valley and disrupt the fifth ‘Karvaan-e-Aman (Caravan of Peace)’’.

‘’We have intercepted messages directing militants to cause large-scale disturbances on or before June 2,’’ the sources said.

However, they said all necessary measures have been taken to foil any such attempt by the militants.

The sources said in view of the threat perception the Hurriyat and other separatist leaders have been asked to travel in their own vehicles to a particular point from where they will board the trans-Kashmir bus.

Those undertaking the journey tomorrow include an 11-member delegation of the APHC, apart from the JKLF Chairman, Mohammad Yaseen Malik, and DFP president, Shabir Ahmad Shah. There are two former APHC chairmen, Abdul Ghani Bhat and Moulvi Abbas Ansari, and Bilal Lone, all executive members, in addition to Mr Fazal-ul-Haq Qureshi. Others who joined the delegation include second rung leaders, Mannan Bukhari, Mohammad amin Qureshi, Syed Saleem geelani and Mohammad Yusuf Naqash. Two party colleagues of the Mirwaiz, Mr Yaqoob Vakil and Mr G M Bhat are also included in the delegation.

Islamabad: Ignoring India’s reservations, Hurriyat leaders will travel to Islamabad from PoK on June 4 for talks with Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz and other leaders.

The Hurriyat leaders, led by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, would arrive in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) by the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus tomorrow.","On June 2, the ""Karvaan-e-Aman"" (Caravan of Peace) bus is scheduled to carry over a dozen separatist leaders from Srinagar to Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) for their first-ever visit. Notable leaders with travel permits include Mirwaiz Umar Farooq (moderate APHC Chairman), JKLF chief Mohammad Yaseen Malik, and Shabir Ahmad Shah of the Democratic Freedom Party. However, hardline Hurriyat chairman Syed Ali Shah Geelani has declined to participate.

Due to intelligence warnings of potential militant attacks aimed at disrupting the fifth such peace journey, a massive security arrangement has been enforced across the Kashmir valley. Sharpshooters and enhanced surveillance have been deployed along the Jhelum Valley Road up to the Kaman post.

Security agencies have reportedly intercepted messages directing militants to create large-scale disturbances before or on June 2. Consequently, separatist leaders will travel in private vehicles to a designated point before boarding the trans-Kashmir bus.

Once in PoK, the Hurriyat leaders are expected to proceed to Islamabad on June 4 to meet Pakistan’s President Pervez Musharraf, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz, and other officials—despite India’s objections.",Politics
The tribune ,2005-06-03 00:00:00,Hurriyat leaders reach PoK Ehsan Fazili,"Srinagar, June 2
About two months after the beginning of the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service coupled with other confidence-building measures between India and Pakistan, a nine-member delegation of Kashmiri Hurriyat leaders crossed the LoC at Kaman bridge to enter PoK today. This being historic journey for improving relations between India and Pakistan, after the bus service had been started for the divided families, is maiden visit of the Hurriyat leaders on the invitation of Pakistan’s government.

While APHC delegation left from the party headquarters at Rajbagh, JKLF chairman, Mohammad Yaseen Malik and Mohammad Abdullah Tahiri left earlier from Malik’s Maisuma residence here this morning. Unprecedented security arrangements were made in the city and en route the 120-km-long route from here to the Kaman bridge on the occasion. This became necessary due to the indifferent attitude of militant organisations towards the Hurriyat leadership’s response to Pakistan’s invitation to visit that country. Apart from the delegation, the fifth caravan of the bus carried 20 passengers on their return journey to PoK and only six fresh passengers from here.

Hundreds of supporters of the leaders comprising the delegation converged at the party headquarters while a large number of light vehicles followed the caravan of the leaders from here to Uri. There was a delay of three hours due to heavy traffic with hundreds of supporters following the Hurriyat delegation to the LoC. It took separatist leaders nearly seven hours to cover 120-km-long distance from here to cross the Kaman bridge, time for lunch at Islamabad and formal checking near the Kaman post also included.

Though JKLF chairman, Mohammad Yaseen Malik accompanied by Mohammad Abdullah Tahiri of Shabir Ahmad Shah’s DFP, undertook the journey separately, APHC chairman, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq heading the delegation said that the goal was the same with different approach. Shabir Ahmad Shah could not undertake the trip to Pok and Pakistan, as he was denied travel documents late last night, apparently for his “Kashmiri citizenship” cited in the application form. Earlier he had decided to go alone after the authorities had reportedly asked him to send not more than four members. But he himself was not provided with travel documents to undertake the journey. His associate, Moulana Abdullah Tahiri later joined JKLF leader, Mohammad Yaseen Malik.

The APHC delegation led by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, apart from him include three other executive members, Abdul Ghani Bhat, Moulvi Abbas Ansari and Bilal Ghani Lone, and the Peoples Political Front (PPF) leader, Mr Fazal-ul-Haq Qureshi. All five members had two rounds of talks with the NDA government at the centre till early last year. The delegation also includes two party colleagues of the APHC chairman Moulvi Umar Farooq’s Awami Action Committee (AAC), Mr Mohammad Yaqoob Vakil and G.M. Bhat.

For the APHC chairman, Moulvi Umar Farooq, the champion of initiation of dialogue to resolve the Kashmir issue, this is more a sentimental journey. He would be paying tributes to his grandfather, Moulvi Mohammad Yusuf Shah, who spent his life in exile on the other side of the LoC and lays buried there. He holds that dialogue which could lead to triangular and finally tripartite talks has been a long standing demand of the APHC. “The mission is to interact with the political and militant leadership on the Kashmir issue” on the other side of the LoC, he claims.

According to former APHC chairman, Abdul Ghani Bhat, the “aim is to build bridges” between the people on the two sides of the LoC. He said that the delegation was going there “with determination and a message of love”. “We want the APHC to rise as a symbol to build bridges between India and Pakistan. This would help develop congenial atmosphere so that issues get resolved through dialogue, he opines.

According to Fazal-ul-Haq Qureshi, opportunity is part of the dialogue process that the APHC had started with the Government of India. He said that dialogue with the people on the other side of the LoC, whosoever it may be, would lead to further improvement of relations and finally resolution of the Kashmir issue, pending over past 57 years. The visit may be followed by the interaction with the Government of India, he opines adding that this would help resolve the long-pending Kashmir issue. He says that the APHC was not against views of the militant organisations, but the “dialogue process is also necessary to reach a conclusion and resolve issues.","On June 2, a nine-member delegation of Hurriyat leaders crossed the Line of Control (LoC) at Kaman Bridge to enter Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), marking a historic moment in Indo-Pak relations and Kashmiri political engagement. This was the first-ever visit by Hurriyat leaders to PoK and Pakistan, made possible by the recently launched Srinagar–Muzaffarabad bus service and Pakistan’s invitation.

Led by APHC chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, the delegation included former chairmen Abdul Ghani Bhat and Moulvi Abbas Ansari, Bilal Ghani Lone, Fazal-ul-Haq Qureshi, and others. Meanwhile, JKLF chairman Mohammad Yaseen Malik and DFP’s Mohammad Abdullah Tahiri traveled separately. Heavy security was deployed due to intelligence inputs on possible militant threats. The bus also carried 20 returning passengers and six fresh travelers.

Shabir Ahmad Shah was denied travel documents at the last minute due to mentioning “Kashmiri citizenship.” The Hurriyat leaders described the journey as both political and emotional, aiming to bridge divides and foster dialogue. Mirwaiz called it a “sentimental journey” to visit his grandfather’s grave in exile. The delegation stressed the importance of dialogue — both with the Indian government and with leadership across the LoC — as a path toward resolving the decades-long Kashmir conflict.",International News
The tribune ,2005-06-04 00:00:00,"Stop terror, Hurriyat leaders tell PoK House","Muzaffarabad (PoK), June 3
Visiting Kashmiri separatist leaders began their political mission to Pakistan today with some sharply critical words for the leadership here for “romanticising” militancy that has cost thousands of deaths in Jammu and Kashmir.

Address to a joint session of the two houses of the so-called “Azad Kashmir” legislature was the high point of the first full day here for Hurriyat Conference Chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and six other leaders of the conglomerate as well as for JKLF Chairman Yasin Malik, who all crossed the LoC to come to PoK from Srinagar yesterday.

Support for the peace process, demand for participation of Kashmiri representatives in the Indo-Pak dialogue and an end to violence was the central theme of their speeches, a day ahead of their visit to Islamabad where they will meet President Pervez Musharraf and other Pakistani leaders.

In forthright comments, Malik said a “romantic aura” created by the PoK leadership about militancy had attracted very talented Kashmiri youth who later lost their lives. He cited examples of a cement factory owner and a pilot who were killed in the course of the militancy.

As an embarrassed PoK Prime Minister Sikander Hayat Khan watched, one of his ministers sought permission to respond to Malik’s comments but did not have his way.

Farooq said the peace process was “not irreversible” if the basic issue was ignored and added that approaches for resolution of the Kashmir problem could be altered for achievement of the goal.

“We want improvement in relations between India and Pakistan. But the peace process cannot be irreversible if attention is diverted from the basic issue, although there can be trade, cultural exchanges and sports,” he said.

He said though “Kashmiris have a just cause, mere justness of it is not enough and time has come to evolve consensus among themselves.”

“Time has come to define goals of Kashmiri leaders” to enable them to evolve a strategy and change it if necessary to attain their goals,” he said.

Farooq attacked hardline Hurriyat leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani, who has turned down Pakistan’s invitation for the visit, for his consistent refusal to join the effort to find a solution to the Kashmir problem.

Without referring to Geelani by name, he said “some people thought that such an approach was negative. I do not agree with them. Hurriyat has decided to make itself relevant to the peace process and wants to become part of it.”

Going a step further, Farooq even obliquely said his faction was ready to go ahead even without Geelani on board. “Time comes in every movement to take decisions. Not everyone will be on board. There is nothing extraordinary about it.”

Apart from Farooq and Malik, those who addressed the assembly were Abbas Ansari, Abdul Gani Bhat and Bilal Lone.

Asserting that he had supported the peace process and talked about flexibility, Malik blamed the Kashmiri leaders on both sides for being hypocritical in toeing the line of Indian and Pakistan governments.

Ridiculing the leaders, he said he wanted to know if any one of them was taken into confidence by the governments of India and Pakistan when the two countries started the peace process.

Contending that “paid servants” cannot change the situation, he said no decision on Kashmir can be “imposed” without consulting Kashmiris and added that “it will not come like that and you have to ask for it.”

Bhat, former Hurriyat Chairman, said Kashmiris were caught between the alleged human rights violation and the killings of top Kashmiri leaders.

Without naming anyone, he said Farooq’s father, the late Mirwaiz, Abdul Ghani Lone and his own brother were among the many who have been assassinated in Kashmir and feared that he could be targetted in future for saying this.

“We need to end the human rights violations in Kashmir.

We want the killings to stop at the earliest. We have to hold dialogue with people holding the guns and ask them to give peace a chance. We want to end violence, insurgency, indignity, humiliation and submission. We want to end them as quickly as possible,” he said.

Calling for change of strategy, Bilal Lone asked the PoK leaders to permit the return of militants who crossed over to this side as they lived in “miserable” conditions here.

“Send them back. We can take care of them and facilitate their return. We will welcome them and do our best to rehabilitate them,” he said. — PTI","Kashmiri separatist leaders, including Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Yasin Malik, began their political mission in PoK on June 3 by criticizing the glorification of militancy, which they said had led to unnecessary loss of lives. Addressing the PoK legislature, they called for Kashmiri participation in the Indo-Pak dialogue and an end to violence. Farooq hinted at moving forward without hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani. The leaders stressed the need for dialogue, human rights, and reintegration of militants. Their visit continues with meetings scheduled with Pakistani leaders in Islamabad.",International News
The tribune ,2005-06-05 00:00:00,Hurriyat leaders in Islamabad Recognition of Kashmir’s disputed status: Pervez,"Islamabad, June 4
Giving a twist to India’s gesture in allowing Kashmiri separatist leaders to travel to Pakistan, President Pervez Musharraf today said it was a recognition of the “disputed status” of Kashmir by both countries.

Hurriyat Chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and eight other separatist leaders from the Kashmir valley were flown from PoK into the Pakistani capital by helicopters around the time the Pakistani ruler was leaving on a three-day visit to the UAE and Qatar. He will meet them on his return here.

The visit of the separatist leaders had “great political significance because they have not come on Indian passports and visas issued by Pakistan,” the General was quoted as saying by the state-run APP news agency at Chaklala airbase before his departure.

So, he said, “it is the recognition of the disputed status of Kashmir by both countries.”

India had expressed reservations over travel by the separatist leaders beyond PoK on special permits but later issued them passports to facilitate it. However, it made it clear that onus for travel by them beyond PoK would be on Pakistan.

Describing the visit as “a very important confidence building measure,” Musharraf said “this is a great leap forward in understanding flexibility being shown by both sides.”

This, he said, should now lead to discussion for the resolution of the Kashmir issue. “The option is open — we hope that it leads on to that.”

After their arrival, the separatist leaders attended a lunch hosted by Pakistan’s Kashmir Affairs Minister, Faisal Saleh Hayat.

“All parties must work together to resolve the (Kashmir) problem,” moderate Hurriyat Chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq said in a brief encounter with the media on arrival here.

The Mirwaiz also stressed that Kashmir “is a political issue and all such issues should be resolved through negotiations.”

The Pakistan Prime Minister will host a lunch for the leaders tomorrow while President Musharraf will meet them on his return from the foreign tour on June 6. ","On June 4, President Pervez Musharraf termed the visit of Kashmiri separatist leaders to Pakistan as a sign of both countries acknowledging Kashmir's disputed status. The leaders, including Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, flew from PoK to Islamabad without Indian passports or Pakistani visas. India, while facilitating the travel, clarified that responsibility for their visit beyond PoK rested with Pakistan. Musharraf called it a major confidence-building step and urged dialogue for resolution.

The Congress, which came under attack during the political turmoil in Goa three months ago, today stormed back to power in the state and swept all three byelections in Haryana but lost in Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka, where the Samajwadi Party opened its account, winning the Shimoga Lok Sabha constituency.

Winning three of the five byelections on its own and with its ally NCP bagging one seat, the Congress-led United Legislature Party raised its tally to 21 in a House of 39 in Goa which came under President’s rule in March after two controversial confidence votes that unseated the BJP and placed Congress in power. The BJP won the fifth seat and raised its tally to 17. It also has the support of the UGDP MLA.

The Samajwadi Party made its parliamentary debut from the South with former Chief Minister S Bangarappa winning the Shimoga Lok Sabha constituency which he had quit as a BJP member to join SP a few months ago. He defeated his nearest rival Ayanur Manjunath, a former foe who now contested on a Congress ticket, by a margin of 16,633 votes.

Elsewhere, the Congress ran out of luck. In the Chamrajpet Assembly constituency in Karnataka vacated by former Chief Minister S.M. Krishna, the party lost to its coalition partner JD (S) when its candidate R.V. Devaraj was humbled by Jamir Ahmed Khan by 3278 votes.

In the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, in the Penukonda Assembly constituency opposition Telugu Desam’s P. Sunita defeated her nearest Congress rival B Sriramulu by 18,850 votes. Sunita cashed in on the sympathy wave generated by the killing of her husband Paritala Ravi, a TDP MLA, late last year in the faction-ridden Rayalaseema region of the state.

The ruling Congress-led United Democratic Front in Kerala was dealt a severe blow when its candidates belonging to the Congress and CMP lost both the byelections to the CPM in Koothuparamba and Azhikode with record margins of defeat.

In retaining the two seats, the CPM-led LDF improved on its performance in the 2001 Assembly poll and bettered its lead in the last year’s Lok Sabha poll in the two segments.

In Uttar Pradesh, retaining its supremacy, the ruling Samajwadi Party-RLD combine swept all four seats to which byelections were held. The SP’s nominees won in Allahabad (West), Varanasi (North) and Haiser Bazar (Reserved) while ally RLD’s candidate won in Khairagarh.

The Congress Legislature Party will meet tomorrow in Panaji to elect its new leader amidst indications that the race for the chief minister would be among Pratapsinh Rane, Ravi Naik and Lusinho Faleiro. — PTI","On June 5, the Congress reclaimed power in Goa, winning three of five bypolls and boosting its tally to 21 in the 39-member Assembly, with ally NCP securing one more seat. The BJP won one seat, raising its total to 17. Congress also swept Haryana’s three bypolls but faced defeats in Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh. Notably, the Samajwadi Party made its southern debut with S. Bangarappa winning in Karnataka’s Shimoga Lok Sabha seat. The Congress Legislature Party is set to meet in Panaji to choose a new Chief Minister.

The tribune ,2005-06-07 00:00:00,TRIBUNE IMPACT Punjab PMT cancelled Jagtar Singh Sidhu and Saurabh Malik,"Chandigarh, June 6
In less than 24 hours after a news report on the leakage of Punjab PMT-2005 question paper appeared in these columns, the Vice-Chancellor of Baba Farid University of Health Sciences, Dr J.S. Gujral, today cancelled the same. Recommendations in this regard were forwarded to the state government late this evening.

The sources in the Punjab Government said the examination was cancelled after the Vice-Chancellor found out that the question paper in possession of The Tribune was indeed a copy of one handed over to the candidates. This is, perhaps, the first time in the state’s history that an entrance examination has been cancelled.

Giving details, the sources said the Vice-Chancellor, after receiving a copy of the question paper from The Tribune during a Press conference held earlier in the evening, compared it with the original to find the two identical.

The sources said the paper, in all probability, had leaked from the binding section. “Someone managed to pull three sheets out of the total 12 and circulated the same”, they said. “The questions contained in the examination paper with the newspaper are at serial number 23 to 66 and 140 to 183.”

The sources added that the matter was likely to be handed over to the Punjab Police for catching the culprit. Dr Gujral, when contacted, said he was left with no other option but to cancel the examination as the career of students could not be compromised with. He added that the probe would now be carried out to fix responsibility.

Earlier in the evening, the state’s Medical Education and Research Minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal directed the Secretary, Medical Education, Mr Sarvesh Kaushal, to ascertain the facts. The Secretary was asked to submit a detailed report after completing the probe as early as possible, preferably within the next 48 hours.

Before that, the Vice-Chancellor also announced a high level probe into the leakage, adding that formal orders in this regard would be issued on Tuesday. Addressing a Press conference from his residence-cum-camp office in Sector 27, Dr Gujral said the names of the inquiry officers would be made public within the next day or two and the report would be submitted within a week or so. The officers in all probability would be from outside the University.

The Vice-Chancellor added that the admission process would not be affected by the probe as the counselling was scheduled to start in the first week of next month. He added that the guilty would not be spared once the allegations of paper leakage were established. Dr Gujral said he would stay in his camp office for the next two days so as to enable persons concerned to bring whatever material they had to establish the allegations.

He, however, refused to provide the question paper handed over to the students for comparison with the one in The Tribune’s possession. “I have absolutely no reasons to doubt the authenticity of the news report, but we would take necessary action after following the due procedure,” Dr Gujral added.

As far as the declaration of results in the evening of the examination day was concerned, he denied the allegations of showing undue haste. “We were simply following the prescribed procedure.”

Dr Gujral added that he was surprised to read about the leakage of the question paper because theirs was more or less a foolproof method. “The question papers are dispatched to the centres between 3.30 am and 4.30 am to avoid the possibility of leakage,” he said,

It may be recalled that all 88 questions faxed to The Tribune a day before the examinations were part of the question paper taken by the students in Amritsar, Faridkot, Jalandhar, Ludhiana and Patiala.
","Following a news report exposing the leak of the Punjab PMT-2005 question paper, Baba Farid University’s Vice-Chancellor Dr. J.S. Gujral cancelled the exam on June 6, after verifying that the leaked paper matched the official version. The leak reportedly originated from the binding section. This marks the first cancellation of a state-level entrance exam in Punjab’s history. A high-level probe has been ordered, with results expected within a week. Despite the cancellation, the admission process is set to proceed on schedule, and police involvement is likely to trace those responsible.

The tribune ,2005-06-07 00:00:00,"Advani quits, but partymen say no Satish Misra and S. Satyanarayanan Tribune News Service","New Delhi, June 7
A rattled and bewildered BJP rallied behind party President L.K. Advani imploring him not to press his resignation for “being relieved from the party post.”

With former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the vanguard trying to prevail upon Mr Advani not to quit as BJP President, there were scores of meetings throughout the day to find a way out of the impasse. However, Mr Advani remained firm in his resolve to resign as the BJP President though several senior leaders expressed confidence that Mr Vajpayee would succeed at some point of time if not immediately in convincing him to relent from his resolve in the interest of the party.

A meeting of the party office-bearers along with the BJP Parliamentary Board has been convened here tomorrow at 5 pm to consider Mr Advani’s letter in which he has asked to be relieved from the party Presidentship, organisation Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu told mediapersons after remaining huddled with Mr Vajpayee and other office-bearers.

“We are confident that Mr Advani will accept the wish of the party and take back his resignation,” a flustered Mr Naidu observed. “Mr Vajpayee told us that Mr Advani was firm on his request to be relieved from the post of party Presidentship.”

He said the BJP strongly condemns VHP leader Praveenbhai Togadia’s anti-Advani statements and taken exception to the acerbic language used by Mr Togadia. Mr Naidu praised the role and “yeoman service” of Mr Advani in building and expanding the base of the BJP.

Mr Naidu praised the contribution of both Mr Advani and Mr Vajpayee to the nation, the cause of Hindutva as well the nationalist forces and the party.

Mr Advani’s letter to BJP General Secretary Sanjay Joshi offers an insight to the Leader of the Opposition’s mind when he remains firm on his comments and observations on Pakistan founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah.

“I have taken this decision after pondering the matter very carefully. And I believe that my visit to Pakistan last week has immensely reinforced the initiatives taken by the NDA Government to bring about peace and normalcy with Pakistan. I have not said or done anything in Pakistan which I need to retract or review”, the one page letter said.

“All the party leaders are of the view that he should withdraw his resignation. They have met former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and discussed the issue. The request of all the leaders, including the allies of the BJP, is that Advani should withdraw the resignation,” party spokesman Prakash Javdekar told newspersons at the party headquarters.

The spokesman maintained that “Advaniji is still the President. There will be no more questions and answers.”

Asked about reports that Mr Naidu has been asked to officiate as President, he pointed out that “he has been coordinating party affairs earlier also.”

Soon after his return here from Manali after a short vacation, Mr Vajpayee spoke to Mr Advani on the telephone after senior party leaders had urged him to persuade Mr Advani to reconsider his decision.

While confirming Mr Vajpayee’s call, Mr Advani’s aides said that they were not aware of the contents of the telephonic conversation between the two leaders.

Making a statement at Bhunter airport, Mr Vajpayee backed Mr Advani’s statement on Pakistan and its founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah who had played an important role in the freedom struggle.

The former Prime Minister also said Mr Advani’s remarks had been “misinterpreted. His remarks on Jinnah are being misinterpreted”.

A senior leader said Mr Advani has played the role of a “statesman” in Pakistan as his statements and observations during his stay in the neighbouring country would go a long way in facilitating the peace process.

“The real villain of the piece are Vishwa Hindu Parishad leaders like Ashok Singhal and Acharya Giriraj Kishore and their loudspeaker Praveenbhai Togadia”, the senior leader said adding that “Mr Advani has initiated a process through which many temples are being restored in Pakistan and the VHP is trying to thwart the whole process. Mr Advani’s statements and comments during his trip to Pakistan would contribute to the conflict resolution process with Pakistan”, he said.

Even as efforts were on to persuade Mr Advani not to press his resignation, inspired rumours suggested that former party president and Human Resource Development Minister Murli Manohar Joshi was being backed by the Sangh Parivar to take over the reins of the BJP.

While Mr Advani’s letter to the party General Secretary said “I am sure acceding to my request (of being relieved from the party presidentship) would be in the best interests of the great cause I have served all my life, as also of the party which has given me so much”, such a decision can only be considered by the party working committee.

Barring protests and welcome statements from the VHP leaders, the Rashtriya Swayamsevk Sangh has maintained that it had not demanded Mr Advani’s resignation.

“Unfortunately, RSS supremo K Sudarshan does not enjoy a moral clout of his predecessors like Golwalkar, Balasaheb Deoras and Professor Rajendara Singh “Rajjubhaia”. Sudarshanji is not in a position to rein in the extremist elements of the VHP”, a BJP senior leader observed adding that “this is not a BJP crisis but of the entire Sangh parivar”.

Meanwhile, Acharya Giriraj Kishore commenting on the resignation of Mr Advani said “ it is in line with the wishes of the people and the party workers that he (Mr Advani) has resigned and I am sure a principled man like him will not withdraw his resignation.”

Asked about VHP firebrand leader Togadia terming Mr Advani a “traitor”, Acharya Kishore said “if anybody has said anything like that then we apologise.

On who would be the VHP’s choice to lead the BJP, Mr Kishore said “It is BJP’s headache but whoever it is he or she should be committed to the Sangh’s ideology.”","On June 7, BJP President L.K. Advani offered to resign following internal backlash over his remarks praising Pakistan’s founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah. Despite mounting pressure from party leaders, including Atal Bihari Vajpayee, to reconsider, Advani remained firm. He defended his Pakistan visit and refused to retract his statements. The BJP condemned VHP leader Praveen Togadia’s attacks on Advani, while speculation grew that the Sangh Parivar might back Murli Manohar Joshi as successor. Vajpayee supported Advani’s stance, saying his comments were misinterpreted. A key party meeting was scheduled to decide the party’s next steps.",National News
The tribune ,2005-06-09 00:00:00,BJP board rejects Advani’s resignation VHP firm on replacement,"The BJP Parliamentary Board and Central Office-Bearers “unequivocally” rejected the resignation of party president L.K. Advani here today. After the meeting, top party leaders, led by Mr M. Venkaiah Naidu, met him and made a renewed appeal to reconsider his decision.

Mr Advani, who tendered his resignation yesterday, is understood to have sought time till tomorrow to respond to the party’s appeal.

All through the day, Mr Advani held firm that there was no question of rescinding his resignation due to the unusual circumstances. After his meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to brief him about his trip to Pakistan, Mr Advani told mediapersons that “the circumstances have not changed.”

At the same time, the BJP Parliamentary Board has been convened to meet again tomorrow when it will take stock of the situation and decide on the further course of action. From all indications it is unlikely that Mr Advani will relent and the party will have to look for an alternative.

An informal exercise is already under way to shortlist leaders who can succeed Mr Advani and also has the backing of the Sangh Parivar.

Simultaneously, the VHP continued with its hard stand that Mr Advani should be replaced by a “Hindu-minded leader” at the helm of affairs of the BJP. “We welcome Advani’s decision to resign, respecting the sentiments of the voters of his constituency and Hindu sentiments. He should stick to his decision,” VHP Vice-President Acharya Giriraj Kishore told newspersons.

The RSS sought to distance itself from the developments in the BJP with its chief K.S. Sudarshan stating in Mumbai that the leadership tangle is an internal matter of the saffron party.

The emergency meeting, chaired by Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu and attended, among others, by former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and chief ministers of BJP-led states, passed a resolution rejecting Mr Advani’s resignation and appealing him to continue to lead the party.

Immediately after the one-hour meeting, the leaders barring Mr Vajpayee and former Union Minister Murli Manohar Joshi, went to Mr Advani’s residence in an attempt to persuade him to withdraw his resignation.

Sources said Mr Advani told the leaders that he would give his decision tomorrow in time for the Parliamentary Board meeting.

He is also understood to have asked the leaders about the stand of the Parliamentary Board and the top brass their views on the controversial remarks on Pakistan founder Mohammed Ali Jinnah, which had irked the RSS and others in the Sangh Parivar.

The leaders who met Mr Advani included Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Babulal Gaur, Jharkhand CM Arjun Munda and Chhattisgarh CM Raman Singh.

The other leaders who met Mr Advani were Ms Sushma Swaraj, Mr Pramod Mahajan, Mr Arun Jaitley, Mr Rajnath Singh, Mr Sushil Modi and Mr Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi.

The resolution, which was full of praise for Mr Advani, said, “The meeting appeals to Mr Advani to continue to lead the party, which he has so ably led in the past.”

“Mr Advani represents the best values in public life. He has scholarly articulated the debate on nationalism in the past few decades with rationality, logic and with powerful idioms,” it said, adding: “His contribution to our ideology is unparalleled.”

“The party has benefited enormously from his leadership and needs his leadership in the future also,” it said.

The resolution also condemned the use of “highly objectionable language” by some leaders of the VHP about Mr Advani.

“These statements have lowered the level of public discourse. Such outbursts, indecent protests and abusive language adversely affects the strength of the nationalist movement in the country. These statements also go against the very ethos of Hinduism,” the resolution said.

Meanwhile, top leaders of the party remained tight-lipped over the next course of action and the scheduled media briefing after the Parliamentary Board Meeting was cancelled at the last minute.","On June 8, the BJP Parliamentary Board and senior leaders unanimously rejected L.K. Advani’s resignation as party president and urged him to reconsider. Despite their appeal, Advani held firm, citing unchanged circumstances following his controversial remarks on Pakistan’s founder Jinnah. He has sought time until tomorrow to respond. The VHP continued to demand his replacement, while the RSS distanced itself from the issue. A resolution passed by BJP leaders praised Advani’s leadership and condemned VHP’s offensive language. With Advani unlikely to relent, informal discussions on potential successors have already begun.",National News
The tribune ,2005-06-10 00:00:00,Advani isolated Satish Misra and S. Satyanarayanan,"New Delhi, June 9
Caught between ideology and leadership, the BJP was today forced to postpone its Parliamentary Board and office-bearers’ meeting till tomorrow to buy time to work out a compromise formula to resolve the crisis triggered by the resignation of party President L K Advani.

Even as franctic efforts were on throughout the day from Advani loyalists, led by Mr M Venkaiah Naidu, to work out a solution by way of a fresh draft resolution, the RSS assertion that it will not tolerate any dilution on its “basic ideology” left little room for manoeuvre for Mr Advani to continue as party President.

Mr Advani, who guided the party to great success in the past two decades, today appeared to be isolated within the party as even his loyalists are understood to have made it clear that they can’t tread on a path which diluted the party’s basic ideology.

A majority of leaders admitted in private that they had no option but to side with the party ideology in the event of a clash between the party ideology and an individual, even if that individual happened to be none other than Mr Advani.

Meanwhile, differences within the party ranks also came to the fore when one of the senior-most leaders and former Union Minister M M Joshi asserted that Jinnah was not secular and that there could be no compromise on the basic ideology of the party.

“I have told the party leaders, including M Venkaiah Naidu, that basic ideology (of the party) should not be diluted in any resolution that may be adopted (by the party) urging Mr Advani to withdraw his resignation,” Mr Joshi, a known detractor of Mr Advani, told newspersons here.

Meanwhile, senior BJP leaders held a series of meeting to work on a draft resolution to be taken up by the Parliamentary Board to accommodate the feelings of L K Advani, who had expressed displeasure that the resolution yesterday had not referred to his Pakistan visit or the context in which his remarks on Jinnah were made.

Sources said the fresh draft resolution, while appreciating his rich contribution to the party and also hailing his recent Pakistan tour as “historic” was categoric that Jinnah was not secular and described him as a man responsible for partition on religious ground.

Referring to the “other face of Jinnah”, particularly his espousal of the two-nation theory, the fresh resolution says judgment on Jinnah’s secular credentials cannot be established on the basis of his one off statement.

The resolution also underlines that the party cannot compromise on its basic ideology, sources said.

Once the draft of the fresh resolution was ready, Mr Naidu along with Mr Pramod Mahajan and Ms Sushma Swaraj went to Mr Advani’s residence to discuss on the draft with him.

Mr Advani is understood to have requested them to give him some more time as he wanted to have a word with senior BJP leader and Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Jaswant Singh, who is returning here from abroad tomorrow, before he makes up his mind, sources said.","On June 9, the BJP postponed its Parliamentary Board meeting amid continued internal crisis over L.K. Advani’s resignation as party president. Efforts by party leaders to persuade him continued, but the RSS’s firm stance on preserving core ideology limited options. A new draft resolution is being prepared to balance support for Advani and reaffirm the party’s opposition to Jinnah’s legacy. Advani remains isolated within the party, with even his allies unwilling to compromise on ideological grounds. He has sought more time to consult senior leader Jaswant Singh before making a final decision.

As many as 15 persons were feared killed when a high velocity storm struck the Bathinda belt bordering Haryana and Rajasthan last night uprooting trees, bringing down electricity and telephone poles and damaging Bathinda distributary, several canals and minors in the area.

So intense was the storm that it wreaked havoc bringing down walls and blowing off tin-sheeted roofs and signboards. Reports of maximum number of deaths came from Fatehabad and Sirsa, where six persons were reported to have died. Although the official death toll for Sirsa district was given as three. The other deaths reported were, two in Bathinda, two in Fatehabad, one in Abohar and one in Yamunanagar.

Six deaths were reported from Fatehabad district. Two labourers were reportedly burnt alive in a fire incident in a cardboard factory in Ratia town of Fatehabad district. In another fire incident one person was killed in the same district. In Bangoan village an aged person was killed when the duststorm uprooted a tree under which he was sleeping. In the same village a four-year-old boy fell into a water reservoir during the storm while a girl was killed when a flying object hit her in Meondakalam village.

SIRSA: At least three persons including two women, were reportedly killed in devastation caused yesterday by high velocity winds here. Unofficial reports put the toll at six.

According to official reports reaching here, Joginder Bai of Kuttabad, Pataki Devi of Chaprian and Ram Singh of Risalia Khera died last night. Families of the three deceased were given exgratia of Rs one lakh from the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund. Cheques for the exgratia were handed over to the families of the deceased today by the Deputy Commissioner, Mr S.K. Goyal.

Meanwhile, according to unconfirmed reports three persons had also died in Dhani Majra and Thobia villages.

The Deputy Commissioner has instructed the BDOs to assess the losses in the village and asked them to submit the reports soon.

DABWALI: Property and crops worth lakhs of rupees were reportedly damaged in last night’s duststorm. Electricity and communication lines were badly damaged.

Hundreds of acacia and eucalyptus trees were uprooted and blocked highways and canals in the district.

Electricity supply to the entire district was severely hit and could be restored only after 4 pm in the town whereas as some parts of the district remained without power till late in the evening. Erratic power supply also hit water supply in the entire district.

Water in Bhakhra main line crossed the danger mark as several trees fell in it. There was a threat of flooding near Khuian Malkana village in Dabwali subdivision.

Timely action by the irrigation department, however, saved the canal which is also known as the lifeline of Rajasthan. Mr M.C. Goyal, Superintendent Engineer, praised the villagers of the area for extending their support to the officials of the department to take the floating trees out of the canal.

BATHINDA: Fierce duststorm accompanied with rain lashed the city for about an hour late last evening throwing normal life out of gear. While two persons died, nine others were injured in and around the district. Various distributaries and minors got damaged due to uprooting of trees.

The Bathinda distributary got damaged in the duststorm and its nearby areas were inundated. The duststorm also damaged Bhadaur distributary, Neor minor, Tapali distributary, Chotian minor, Bhundar minor, Ginda Manda minor, Maan minor and Mithari minor.

The Xen, Mr S.K. Sathana, said the situation was under control now, but they would have to keep a strict vigil tonight as further damage in any of these minors and distributaries could cause extensive damage. He said the main problem that they were facing was the closure of the main canal for carrying out the repair work. He said the main Bathinda branch was flowing above the danger mark and he was closely monitoring the situation. He said the repair work on Bathinda distributary was carried out from 1.45 pm to 4.45 pm today and subsequently 50 cusecs of waster was released in it. He said they would increase the water level slowly up to the 160 cusec mark. He said if everything went right then all distributaries and minors would regain their original shape by tomorrow night.

The tribune ,2005-06-12 00:00:00,A world first in N-power programme Arup Chanda,"Kalpakkam (Tamil Nadu), June 11
India has made a big leap forward in its nuclear power programme by achieving reprocessing of nuclear fuel with high plutonium content with a high burn-up mark for the first time in the world.

Addressing a press conference here today at the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR), about 70 km from Chennai, Dr Anil Kakodkar, Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission and Secretary of Department of Atomic Energy, said for the first time the plutonium and uranium-rich carbide fuel with a high burn-up mark of 147.8 giga watts day per tonne had been achieved.

He said: “The fast breed test reactor here is unique because it is using carbide fuel. It was a bold step and as a part of cautious approach the target for burnup was fixed at 25,000 mega watts day per tonne. But what has been achieved is six times of the target.”

Dr Baldev Raj, Director, IGCAR, said: “The department is committed to efficiently closing the fast reactor fuel cycle by safely reprocessing future discharges of spent fuels with increasing burnups and in achieving the energy security for the country”.

He said while the fast breed reactors (FBR) had been using oxide and carbide fuel the facility had decided to “ leapfrog into using metallic fuel in specially designed FBRs”.

Dr Kakodkar said: “The IGCAR is focused on developing metallic fuel for specially designed FBRs. We have been using oxide and carbide fuel but we will leapfrog into using metallic fuel in the next 10 years.”

He said scientists at the IGCAR had been working on reprocessing of nuclear fuel and had been successful.

Explaining the scientific process of reprocessing of nuclear fuel and how much energy it can generate he said: “To put it for a layman I would say 100,000 mega watts day per tonne mean that just one gram of fuel can keep a 50 watt bulb lighted for three to four years.”

He said the country was going to be living with energy shortage as 50 years from now the demand would be 1300 to 1400 giga watts day per tonne in India. “We have to extract maximum energy from the minerals and hence reprocessing is very important,” he added.

Asked how much plutonium was extracted, Mr Kakodkar said: “I have no answer for such questions and you should know which questions not to ask”.

The extraction of plutonium or uranium is one of the country’s top secrets as it will give away the stocks and also indicate how much of it was being diverted for manufacturing nuclear weapons.

He said: “We have a plan to rapidly go on to the second phase of our nuclear power plan which will consist of more FBRs. They will be designed to meet India’s request which is different from rest of the world. The modest quantity of uranium in our soil was enough to meet the requirement”.

“Our nuclear programme is unique dictated by our own conditions. We are placing very high emphasis on research.

We will take more steps to strengthen domestic research and technology,” he added.","India has achieved a major milestone in its nuclear programme by successfully reprocessing high plutonium-content carbide fuel with a record burn-up of 147.8 GWd/t at the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR), Kalpakkam. This is the first such accomplishment globally. Atomic Energy Commission Chairman Dr. Anil Kakodkar highlighted this leap as part of India's fast breeder reactor (FBR) strategy, with plans to transition to metallic fuel in the next decade. The development marks a critical step towards energy security and maximizing energy extraction from limited uranium resources. Officials refrained from disclosing plutonium extraction data, citing national security.",Science and Technology
The tribune ,2005-06-13 00:00:00,Let Siachen be a peace mountain: PM Rules out redrawing of established borders,"Siachen, June 12
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said the time had come to convert the world’s highest battlefield, Siachen, into a “peace mountain” without redrawing “established borders”.

“Now the time has come and we should try to convert this battlefield into a peace mountain,” the Prime Minister said in his address to the troops at the base camp here before winding up his three-day visit to Jammu and Kashmir.

Ruling out recasting geographical contours, the Prime Minister said in his address, delivered in Hindi, that “these borders are not only necessary but also indispensable for the honour of our country”.

Any solution arising from the ongoing peace process with Pakistan would take “full care” of the security and well-being of the troops.

Dr Manmohan Singh, who also made an aerial survey of the forward areas along the Siachen glacier for about 20 minutes, ignoring the advice of Army officials and his personal physician, told the jawans and officials of the armed forces that the whole country was concerned about them. “I am proud of seeing your patriotism and your determination,” he said.

Telling them that he was here to see how to provide some relief from the difficult living conditions, he announced the construction of two home theatres for their entertainment and a CT-scan centre for better healthcare facilities.

He told them that they were keeping vigil on the barren, hostile mountains to protect the honour of the country without grumbling.

“But the question arises how long this situation can continue. On the one hand, the youth of this country is protecting the country by sacrificing its happiness and on the other, the troop deployment is affecting the sanctity of the mountains. We should create an atmosphere in which no one perceives any danger and this place becomes an example of perfect peace,” he said.

Asked to throw more light on this statement, the Prime Minister told reporters at Leh before taking his special flight to Delhi, that “we have to consider new ways” to resolve the problem.

To a question on his visit to Siachen, he said, “I was privileged to go to Siachen where our brave soldiers are defending our frontiers so gallantly. It was a great emotional moment for me.”

To another query, he said the people of Ladakh could rest assured that the Centre would do everything to bring peace and prosperity for them.

During his three-day visit, the Prime Minister stayed at Leh on both intervening nights. He laid the foundation stone for two 45-MW hydel power projects—one in Kargil and another at Leh—to improve the power situation in the region and addressed the jawans and officials of 14 Corp, besides visiting Siachen.

Immediately on his arrival at the Siachen base camp, Dr Manmohan Singh took rest for about 20 minutes, before giving his address and proceeding on the aerial survey. In all, he spent about two hours in the area.

The first Prime Minister to visit the Siachen sector in Jammu and Kashmir situated at over 12,000 ft altitude, he said efforts should be made to create such an atmosphere of peace here wherein “nobody fears any threat, there is no scope for any conflict and this place becomes an example of peaceful environment.”

Briefed by top Army officers about the prevailing situation, he noted in the address to troops here that “Siachen is called the highest battlefield” where living is very difficult.

“How long shall we allow such conditions to prevail (in Siachen)?” he said. “Now the time has come for us to make efforts to convert this battlefield into a peace mountain.”

He added talks were going on with Pakistan in this regard.

Emphasising that India wanted peaceful relations with Pakistan, the Prime Minister, however, asserted that in pursuit of this, “we are not ready to accept any changes in the drawn and established boundaries of the country.

“We feel, these boundaries are important not only for our security but it relates to the country’s honour also. For this prestige, Indian soldiers are happily bearing difficulties here (in Siachen).”

He said the path of the future may be ridden with challenges and difficulties but with everyone’s contribution these will be overcome.

Addressing troops, he praised their sacrifice and announced new welfare measures, including home theatres and a CT-scan facility.

A powerful explosion rocked Pulwama in South Kashmir today, killing at least 15 persons and injuring over 90 others, many of them seriously. Many shops, houses and vehicles were damaged in the explosion. Those killed included three CRPF personnel, including a Commandant, and two students. More than 10 students were among the injured in the explosion.

Tension gripped Pulwama town soon after the explosion, where a large number of persons took to the streets, protesting against the police and civil administration. The protesters held that the official claim of the explosion having been caused a car having RDX was wrong and no senior officials reached the spot even after an hour of the explosion. The police fired in the air to quell the demonstrators and had to lob teargas shells to bring the situation under control. More than 10 protesters were injured in clash with the police.

The Director-General of Police, Mr Gopal Sharma and other senior police and civil administration officials rushed to the spot to take stock of the situation. The IG Police, Mr Javed Makhdoomi, said that 15 shops were damaged in the explosion, which took place at around 11.30 a.m. He said the explosion took place in a car carrying RDX. However, the immediate cause of the explosion was not yet known. The explosion took place in a busy market place in the vicinity of a high school, State Bank of India, CRPF 68 bn camp, post office and a shopping complex.

No militant organisation has claimed responsibility for the attack which came a day after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s visit to Jammu and Kashmir which took him to Kargil, Leh and Siachen. This is the third such incident of high magnitude during the past one month.

At least three persons were killed and several others injured in a car bomb explosion at Jawahar Nagar early last month. Two women were killed and about 50 others were injured, including 30 students of a local school, in another grenade explosion in the Lal Chowk area later.

In today’s explosion, at least nine persons, most of them civilians died on the spot while five others succumbed to their injuries in various hospitals here. The CRPF men killed were identified as P.R.V. Prasad, Amba Rao and J.D.R. Kumar. Of the injured, 42 have been admitted in the SMHS hospital, eight in the SKIMS, Soura, five in the Bone and Joints Hospital here.

Nine others were admitted to Pulwama district hospital, while one was being treated at Pampore hospital.","A powerful explosion in Pulwama, South Kashmir, killed at least 15 people, including three CRPF personnel and two students, and injured over 90 others.

The tribune ,2005-06-15 00:00:00,Punjab hikes power tariff by 10.27 pc,"Chandigarh, June 14
Illustration by Gaurav Sood The Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission today hiked the power tariff by 10.27 per cent across the board except the farming sector and Scheduled Castes, thus putting a financial burden of Rs 768.65 crore on the power consumers in the state for the current financial year. The announcement in this connection was made by the Commission’s Chairman, Mr R.S. Mann.

However, the actual increase in case of rural domestic power consumers will be 20.27 per cent as the 10 per cent rebate, which was given to them during the last financial year because of the poor quality of power supply to the rural areas, has been abolished. In other words, the Commission has given a big blow to rural domestic power customers. Sources said there were differences among members of the Commission over the abolition of rebate given to rural areas. One of the members insisted that it must be abolished and then other members, to avoid on unsavoury situation, agreed with him.

In fact, according to the sources, there were also differences about the overall increase in the tariff rates. Certain members wanted that the increase should not be above 6 per cent in any case but ultimately the increase in tariff ordered is above10 per cent.

The Commission has also increased the minimum monthly charge by 10.27 per cent for all categories. Even the power rates for the Golden Temple Complex and the Durgiana Mandir in Amritsar have been increased.

The rates for the farming sector, except a small section of farmers who get metered power supply, have not been increased by the Commission on the request of the state government because it has promised to give Rs 1065.18 crore as subsidy to compensate the PSEB for providing power to this sector on low rates. And for the Scheduled Castes, the state government has promised to give Rs 50 crore as subsidy to the PSEB.

However, the tariff rate for the farmers, who get metered supply and whose number is nearly 45,000, has been increased from 57 paise per unit to 62 paise per unit. Roughly calculated, this increase is 9 per cent. The Commission has allowed the PSEB to charge the upward revised rates of tariff with retrospective effect that is from April 1, last.

In fact, the increase in the tariff rates is a second major shock for power consumers. Earlier, the state government had increased the electricity duty by 5 per cent in April this year putting a financial burden of Rs 350 crore, which is to go to the dedicated fund created for the oldaged and other pensioners.

Besides, the Commission had tabulated that the PSEB got Rs 291 crore in excess of its determined revenue requirement during the year 2003-04 and had promised to pass on this money to power consumers by making adjustments in tariff rates accordingly for the current financial year. But this amount appears to have disappeared as no benefit of this amount was passed on to the power consumers today by the Commission. Explaining this point the Commission authorities said after the rechecking of Board’s accounts, it had been found that the excess revenue amount was only Rs 36.66 crore and this amount had been adjusted in the revenue deficit of the Board for 2004-05.

Power tariff experts say the overall financial burden, with the inclusion of electricity duty amount of Rs 350 crore and Rs 291 crore, which was to be passed on to consumers but now has been adjusted in revenue deficit, on power consumers during the current financial year, will be in the range of Rs 1409 crore. This figure includes Rs 768.65 crore also which the Board is to collect from power consumers during the current financial by way of increased tariff rates. For domestic supply, tariff rates up to 100 units have been increased from 200 paise to 221 paise and for 101 to 300 units the tariff has been hiked from 334 paise to 368 paise. For the above-300-unit slab, the new rate will be 389 paise and for non residential and public lighting category it will be 423 paise.

In the industrial sector, the rate has been hiked from 306 to 337 paise for small power supply and 337 to 372 paise for medium power supply and same rate will be applicable for large supply units. For bulk supply the rate has been increased from 357 paise to 394 paise on average basis.

For Railways, the rate has been increased from 402 paise to 443 paise. For Golden Temple and Durgiana Mandir, first 2000 units will be free of cost and above this rates have been increased from 273 paise to 301 paise. There are separate rates for season industry and ice factories etc.","The Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission has raised power tariffs by 10.27% across all categories, excluding the farming sector and Scheduled Castes, placing an additional ₹768.65 crore burden on consumers for the current fiscal year. Rural domestic consumers face a higher effective increase of 20.27% due to the removal of a previous 10% rebate. Tariffs have also been retrospectively applied from April 1. The increase follows an earlier 5% electricity duty hike, raising the total burden to approximately ₹1,409 crore. While most farmers remain unaffected due to government subsidies, those with metered supply will see a 9% hike. Rates for religious sites like the Golden Temple and Durgiana Mandir were also raised beyond their initial 2,000 free units. Differences reportedly emerged within the Commission on both the increase rate and the removal of rural rebates.",Business and Finance

Asking the Governors to rise above partisan politics while discharging their constitutional obligations, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh urged them to play the role of elder statesmen in ensuring that inter-state issues are handled with sagacity without spilling over as major disputes.

The Prime Minister also urged them to play a positive role in ensuring that communal harmony prevailed in all corners of the country. He also told them to play a pro-active role, as Chancellors of universities, to improve the quality of our universities and bring them up to world standards.

""In these turbulent times we are living in, people have great expectations from this office(Governor). This places an added burden on your shoulders to rise above partisan politics while discharging your constitutional obligations,"" Dr Singh said while speaking on the second day of the two-day Governors' Conference at Rashtrapati Bhavan here.

""The role of the Governor has varied over time and space, and has come under close public scrutiny. The greater the responsibilities attached to an office, the greater will be public scrutiny in a democracy,"" Dr Singh said.

In this context, the Prime Minister pointed out that ""In our evolving polity, where political patterns have changed substantially over the last 50 years, there is bound to be some partisan controversy or the other challenging the authority and dignity of this high office.""

Pointing that an area which is causing some friction in our polity is the interface between states, whether it be on the sharing of waters, or on sharing minerals or on sharing electricity, Dr Singh said ""there is need for Governors to play the role of elder statesmen in ensuring that inter-state issues are handled with sagacity without spilling over as major disputes and often, as law and order problems.""

Asking the Governors to act as watchdogs and alert the State and Central governments on security threats, Dr Singh said ""removed from the hustle and bustle of day-to-day activities, Governors are extremely well placed to assess long term trends in many matters and utilize their wisdom to aid governments in their actions.""

Dr Singh said in some cases, internal security problems were a consequence of uneven economic growth, inequities in social institutions or political shortcomings, sometimes these were ""outright acts of extremism and terrorism for which there can be no space in a democratic polity.""

""Governors must guide Chief Ministers and help them deal with such situations, distinguishing between the genuine and legitimate expression of dissent and disaffection and the manifestations of anti-national, anti-social and anti-people threats to our democratic way of life,"" he said.

On the economic front, the Prime Minister said after years of the so-called ""Hindu rate of growth,"" the country was in a position to post a 7-8 per cent growth to which there were ""no external constraints"" any longer.

""It is very much in the realm of possibility for this country to become a prosperous nation, rid of the perennial scourges of poverty, ignorance and disease,"" he said emphasising that Governors had a critical role to play in the nation's progress.

""While many changes have taken place at the national level in the economic sphere over the last two decades, much more needs to be done...Much of this is to be done at the State level and hence, the role of Governors in ensuring that this happens,"" the Prime Minister said.

Asserting that Governors can play a positive role in ensuring that communal harmony prevails in all corners of the country, Dr Singh said ""they can be a calming influence in turbulent times, a voice of moderation, a soothing hand to those in distress.""

Urging the Governors to remain pro-active in strengthening the foundations and the sinews of our educational system, Dr Singh said ""Governors must play an active role both inn improving literacy rates and school enrollment and in ensuring academic excellence in universities.""

""Our university system is crying out for reform. I urge Governors, who are Chancellors of universities, to improve the quality of our universities and bring them up to world standards,"" he added.","Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, addressing the Governors’ Conference at Rashtrapati Bhavan, urged Governors to rise above partisan politics and act as elder statesmen, particularly in managing inter-state disputes involving resources like water, minerals, and electricity. Emphasizing their constitutional role, he asked them to foster communal harmony, act as watchdogs on security issues, and support Chief Ministers in distinguishing between legitimate dissent and anti-national threats. He also encouraged Governors to be proactive in education, especially as Chancellors of universities, and to lead reforms aimed at improving literacy and raising university standards to global levels.

The Union Cabinet today gave its approval for amending the Citizenship Act 1955. This would pave the way for granting dual citizenship to persons of Indian origin (PIOs) who migrated to other countries after January 26, 1950.

The amendments will allow the Ministry of Overseas Indians to issue notifications under Section 7B (1) of the Citizenship Act, 1955, and issue smart cards to registered overseas citizens of India (OCI).

“The amendment will give benefit to all persons of Indian origin, and their children and grand children, who migrated from India to countries other than Pakistan and Bangladesh after January 26, 1950” , Minister of Information and Broadcasting Jaipal Reddy told newspersons after the Cabinet meeting.

It will benefit people who were eligible to become citizens on this date or belonged to territories, which became part of India after August 15, 1947 to acquire overseas citizenship “as long as their home countries allow dual citizenship in some form or the other”.

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had announced the decision to allow dual citizenship to overseas Indians during the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas held in Mumbai early this year.

He had said the facility would be extended to Indians as long as their home countries permitted them to do so. Earlier, it was limited to Indians based in certain countries.

The Ministry of Overseas Indians is currently working on simplification of a host of rules which were cumbersome. For example, the application forms for Overseas Indian Citizenship were lengthy and asked the applicant to disclose a lot of personal details. These application forms had to submitted to Indian missions overseas, which, in turn, had to be transmitted to New Delhi for sanction.

Now, powers will be delegated to Indian consulates abroad to sanction the applications and in the next three months or so, the Overseas Indian Citizenship facility will start in 16 countries already short listed.","The Union Cabinet approved amendments to the Citizenship Act, 1955, allowing dual citizenship for Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) who migrated after January 26, 1950, excluding those from Pakistan and Bangladesh. The amendment enables the Ministry of Overseas Indians to issue smart cards to Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) under Section 7B(1) of the Act. This policy benefits descendants of Indian citizens whose home countries permit dual citizenship. The process for obtaining overseas citizenship will be simplified, with Indian consulates abroad gaining the authority to approve applications. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had earlier announced this initiative during the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas. The new system is expected to be operational in 16 countries within three months.",Politics
The tribune ,2005-06-18 00:00:00,Bonanza for farmers Hooda waives power arrears of Rs 1600 crore,"Chandigarh, June 17
In a significant decision, which should go a long way in resolving the long-standing contentious issue the unpaid electricity dues by farmers of the state, the Hooda government in Haryana today waived a whopping Rs 1600 crore outstanding power arrears of farmers and other rural domestic consumers.

The Chief Minister, Mr Bhupinder Singh Hooda, who made the announcement in the Vidhan Sabha, described the decision as ""historical and unprecedented, which no other government could take in the past and no government would take in future.""

Coming down heavily on the Indian National Lok Dal and its leader, Mr Om Prakash Chautala, Mr Hooda said during the past one decade, ""gullible and simple farming community"" of the state was misled into non-payment of electricity dues by ""opportunistic politicians"", promising free electricity and free water.

""In fact, the very edifice of the erstwhile INLD Government during the 2000 Assembly elections was the propagation of the patently false promise of giving free power. All that the farmers received at the end of the day were bullets and brutalities, subjugation and suppression as also unspeakable cruelty. Kandela to Gulkani -- the history of the farmers' agitations was written with a long trail of blood and dead bodies,"" he added.

Soon after coming to power, Mr Hooda had constituted a Cabinet subcommittee under the chairmanship of the Finance Minister, Mr Birender Singh, to find a solution to this issue, which had been bringing the successive governments and a section of the farming community into a confrontation, leading to police firings on the agitating farmers.

The arrears of only those consumers in the rural sector would be waived off who pay the future bills regularly. To ensure this, the government has decided that 10 per cent of the arrears would be written off with the payment of each of the next 10 bills on a two-month cycle basis. Thus, if a consumer pays regularly and ""uninterruptedly"" his electricity dues for the next 20 months, his entire arrears would stand paid off.

As a reward to those rural sector consumers who paid their bills regularly, the government decided to give them 5 per cent rebate on their dues for the next 20 months. This decision has been obviously taken to respect the sentiments of the farming community of those districts which constitute the ""tubewell belt"" along the G.T. Road. Residents of Ambala, Yamunanagar, Karnal, Kurukshetra, part of Kaithal and certain other districts never agitated for free power. Their only demand had been ""quality and adequate"" power. The government did not want to punish this belt for being law-abiding.

Mr Hooda said though the Congress had never made a false commitment on the power bills, it wanted to resolve the issue in a manner so as to provide relief to the entire farming community, encourage them to pay their bills regularly and at the same time protect the financial health of the power utilities.

He did not agree that he should have taken this step near the elections. ""We do not believe in politics of vote. We want to help the farming community and villagers.""

A former Haryana Congress President, Mr Shamsher Singh Surjewala, said by taking this decision at this juncture when the elections were nowhere near, the Hooda Government would generate more goodwill. ""People do understand that near the elections, the politicians always offer sops, "" he added.

The State BKU chief, Mr Ghasi Ram Nain, who led the farmers' agitation in 2002 and against whom the INLD regime had slapped a sedition case, also welcomed the government's announcement, saying it would help the already suffering farming community.

Though he did not give details of how the government planned to compensate the cash-starved power utilities for the loss of about Rs 1600 crore, Mr Hooda said part of the financial gap would be covered by reducing the losses, improving the infrastructure and making the billing and collection system more effective.

For the remaining gap, he said, the government would help the utilities to pay the instalments of the loans raised to cover the arrears.

Since the arrears would be waived off in two financial years, the government would not have to pay the entire amount of Rs 1600 to the power utilities in this year alone. It also hopes that once the farmers start paying their current bills regularly, the cash flow of the power utilities would automatically increase.

Mr Hooda did not agree that the urban consumers who had been paying their bills regularly had been discriminated against and some political party could mislead them into not paying their bills on the pattern of the rural voters. He said his government had allocated Rs 100 crore for the first time in the history of the state for the development of urban areas.

He said the government was giving several facilities to the urban areas which were not available in the rural areas. His government was committed to the development of all the areas of the state so that migration from the villages to the urban areas could be checked.

He said the Rs 1600 crore which would be waived off, included about Rs 550 crore as surcharge.

Dr Sushil Indora and Dr Sita Ram of the INLD also welcomed the announcement but said that the arrears should have been waived ""unconditionally"". They said their party also felt that the farmers should pay their bills regularly.","In a major move, Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda announced the waiver of ₹1,600 crore in unpaid electricity dues for farmers and rural domestic consumers. The waiver, announced in the Vidhan Sabha, applies only to those who consistently pay future bills. Under the scheme, 10% of the arrears will be waived with the payment of each bimonthly bill over 20 months. Regular payers will also receive a 5% rebate. The decision, aimed at resolving a decades-old issue that had led to violent protests, was welcomed by farmers’ unions and opposition leaders, though some called for unconditional relief. Mr. Hooda criticized previous INLD governments for misleading farmers and emphasized the Congress’s intention to provide long-term solutions. The financial gap created by the waiver will be partially addressed through improved infrastructure and billing systems, with state support for the rest. Urban areas, Mr. Hooda assured, are receiving parallel investments and attention.",Business and Finance

He also announced that nearly Rs 2,000 crore would be pumped into Reliance Capital whose board today elected him as its Chairman.

Reliance Capital, Reliance Energy and Reliance Infocomm have gone under the control of Anil under the settlement plan announced by his mother Kokilaben yesterday.

Soon after REL re-elected him as its Chairman today, the younger Ambani announced massive expansion plans in gas-based, coal-based and hydro and nuclear power generation in the next 10 years.

He expressed the intention to form private-public partnership for nuclear power generation. REL also has “deep commitment” in non-conventional power — solar and wind power, he added.

“A number of friends in the media asked me—what will this new group look like? I refer this new group as Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Enterprises,” Anil said after the board meeting of Reliance Energy here today.

Apart from Reliance Capital, Anil also announced Rs 1,000 crore capital infusion in Reliance Energy and foray into greenfield infrastructure projects like airport. The new group would bid for airport projects of both Delhi and Mumbai, he said.

Dispelling fears of cash crunch in carrying out the expansion, he said potential investors had been talking to him for investing in the three companies REL, Reliance Infocomm and Reliance Capital.

Moreover, he said the group would list Reliance Infocomm in bourses in due course to mop up additional capital.

Reliance Capital would be made a financial power house offering a spectrum of financial products, he said.

“ADA Enterprise Group will invest Rs 1,000 crore in Reliance Energy. I personally believe this as reflection of my own personal confidence on the future growth prospects, valuable management team and shareholders of the company,” Reliance Energy Chairman Anil told reporters here.

After attending the board meeting of Reliance Energy and Reliance Capital, he said this proposed investment would be at Rs 573 per share price, representing 8 per cent premium in a six-month average price.

“Reliance Capital is to turn into a full spectrum of financial service power house. ADA Enterprise Group will also invest Rs 2,000 crore in the company at a price of Rs 228 per share at 40 per cent premium at a six-month average high price,” Anil said.

The government today hiked the prices of petrol and diesel by Rs 2.50 and Rs 2 per litre, respectively, after a gap of seven months, leaving the Left parties fuming, which called for a nationwide strike on June 28.

The UPA government, however, spared mass cooking fuel LPG and kerosene from the increase.

A 7 per cent increase in the petrol and diesel prices, which would come into effect from midnight tonight, had been warranted due to increasing prices of international crude oil, the government said.

Incidentally, the price hike announcement came on a day when more than 90 per cent of petrol stations in the country were shut, demanding an increase in commission.

CPI national secretary D. Raja said: “The Left parties do not agree with the government on increasing the prices of petrol and diesel. It will have a cascading effect and heap a huge burden on the common man and adversely affect the economy, which is already witnessing an upward trend in inflation and general price rise.”

“We are not dogmatic, but realistic. That is why we had given several suggestions to the government, but it did not consider these. It is also politically incorrect to increase the prices,” he added.

With this oil price hike, India has joined other Asian nations, including China, in hiking the petrol and diesel prices in recent months. Oil prices in the international market, however, touched a new high of $59 per barrel and indications are that the country’s oil requirement would touch to 80,000 barrel per day.

Oil companies are not very happy with the government’s decision, as the CCEA had not acceded to their demand. They had sought an increase of Rs 4.68 per litre in petrol and Rs 5.13 per litre on diesel.

“We have basically gone back to the principle of equitable burden-sharing between the government, the consumers and the oil companies,” Petroleum Minister Mani Shankar Aiyar told reporters after a Cabinet meeting.

He said the objective behind the oil price increase was that “our oil sector companies should not suffer cash loss. Their profits must be such as to service their equity obligations and profits must be adequate to meet the investment requirements of the future.

Mr Aiyar said the upstream firms Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), GAIL (India) Ltd and Oil India Ltd will continue to share the revenue loss of oil marketing firms on LPG and kerosene this fiscal.

“This is a one-time hike and we may consider reverting to the mechanism of fixing prices every fortnight only after international oil prices stabilise,” he said.

Mr Aiyar said upstream firms contributed about Rs 3,000 crore towards sharing of losses on LPG and kerosene sale in 2003-04. This amount nearly doubled in 2004-05. “This subsidy-sharing scheme will continue in 2005-06,” he added.

However, four Left parties in a joint statement, while urging the government to reverse the decision and take measures which can absorb the burden of the increased international oil prices, called upon the people all over the country “to join together to register their protest by coming out on the streets on June 28.”

The CPM, the CPI, the RSP and the Forward Bloc said it was “unfortunate” that the government had not taken up the alternatives given by them to avert the price hike.

Among the suggestions given in this regard were cancellation of additional cess of 50 paise per litre of petrol for highways, making changes in the excise duty pattern so that it did not lead to retail price hike and doing away with import parity in product price.

The Left parties had suggested the creation of a price stabilisation fund to meet global fluctuation in crude prices with the cess collected on indigenous crude amounting to Rs 5,400 crore per annum. They had sought a review of the duty drawback payment to petro product exporters by private refineries.

“While it is true that international oil prices have been rising, the government in the Budget itself changed the excise duties which led to an added burden of Rs 1.70 per litre of petrol and Rs 1.15 per litre of diesel. The road cess of Rs 1.50 has been increased by 50 paise to Rs 2.00,” the statement said.","On June 20, the Indian government increased petrol prices by ₹2.50 per litre and diesel by ₹2, marking a 7% hike due to surging global crude oil prices, which hit $59 per barrel. LPG and kerosene prices remained unchanged. The decision, effective at midnight, sparked strong backlash from Left parties, who called for a nationwide strike on June 28, accusing the government of ignoring alternative suggestions and burdening the public. Petrol pumps were already shut due to a separate strike by dealers demanding higher commissions. Petroleum Minister Mani Shankar Aiyar defended the hike, citing the need to maintain oil companies’ financial health and investment capabilities. Oil firms had demanded a larger hike but received less. The Left parties proposed alternate measures like duty restructuring, using the crude cess fund, and scrapping import parity pricing. The government reiterated the move as a one-time adjustment amid volatile global oil trends.",Business and Finance

As many as 19 persons were killed and 20 others injured when a private bus, they were travelling in, fell into a gorge here around 12:30 am today.

Almost all passengers were either BSNL employees or their family members from Vadodara in Gujarat. They had chartered the bus from Delhi and were on their way to Manali when the mishap took place.

The driver of the bus apparently failed to negotiate a sharp turn on the highway and lost control. The bus rolled down into the steep Charankhud. Many passengers died of critical injuries after they hit boulders head-on.

They were rushed to Dr Rajendra Prasad Zonal Hospital in Dharamsala and the condition of those injured is reported to be stable. Both driver and conductor of the bus have survived.

The BSNL employees were on an LTC tour and were heading for Manali.

Of the total 39 passengers 10 men and nine women are among those declared dead while 13 men and seven women sustained injuries. The only child among the passengers has survived.

Mr N.B. Barot, one of the injured, said he heard a shattering noise before the bus started floating in the air before it rolled down into the deep gorge and hit the rock. “Before I could realise what had happened, most of us lay writhing in pain and others simply motionless. Remains of the bus were scattered all over the place,” he said.

There was no indication on the road about the sharp curve and since the driver was not a local, he might not have anticipated such a sudden turn going downhill at a reasonable speed, he said.

Local MLA Chandresh Kumari visited the hospital and spoke to the injured about their condition.

Meanwhile, the cremation of those killed is a major concern for the district administration. Since most of the family members will be able to reach here by this evening, preservation of the bodies till then would have to be ensured.

Deputy Commissioner Bharat Khera said the administration was waiting to hear from the BSNL authorities as to whether all cremations would be done here. Otherwise, considering the distance, transportation of the bodies would be a big problem.

“Since the identification process is still on till this afternoon, we can only tell those making inquiries from Vadodara that they should rush here immediately,” said Mr Khera.

SDM Rakesh Kumar said even informing relatives of the passengers was an onerous task and the hospital staff and local officials helped in sending across messages. “Desperate family members of the passengers have been calling me to get updates on their condition,” he said.

Mr Khera said the names of all those killed in the accident had been established but some bodies were yet to be identified as either their entire families had died or they were travelling alone. The post-mortem on the bodies was conducted today.

Local residents helped in taking out some of the injured from the debris. “I was sleeping on my terrace when I saw the bus falling down. On rushing there, we found that eight persons had already died. We helped the passengers and took them out of the khud,” said a local youth.

Those killed in the accident include: Ms Jasodaben B. Patel, Mr Deepak Kumar Lalchand Shah, Mr Jagdishbhai Vitthalbhai Doshi, Mr Bhikhabhai Becharbhai Chauhan, Ms Narmadaben B.Chauhan, Mr Jayantilal Kantilal Darji, Mrs Dhanuben J.Darji, Mr Virendra Harikrishna Pandya, Mr Pravinchandra Jayram Gohil, Mr Dhirubhai Govindbhai Patel, Ms Ranjanben D.Patel, Dr (Ms) Daxaben R.Parghi, Ms Revtiben S.Barve, Ms Ilaben B.Tailor, Ms Manguben A.Oza, Mr Jevabhai Shivdas Patel, Ms Shantaben J.Patel, Mr Maneklal Narainbhai Patel and Mr Tulsi.

Meanwhile, the Himachal Pradesh Government has ordered an inquiry into the accident. State Transport Minister G.S. Bali said today.

“An inquiry has been ordered into the reasons of the accident,” he told reporters here.

Mr Bali also announced a relief of Rs 1 lakh each to the relatives of those killed and free and proper treatment to the injured.

State Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh has expressed grief over the accident and conveyed his condolences to the bereaved families.

Governor V.S. Kokje has also expressed grief over the accident.

Two IAF choppers have been pressed into service with the help of the Central Government to take the bodies of those killed in the accident to Vadodara. From Dharamsala, the choppers would fly first to Pathankot and then to Vadodara tomorrow morning. The decision was reportedly taken after some of the injured said they wanted their spouses killed in the accident to be cremated in their hometown.

The district administration has also declared that kin of the passengers would be provided aid as per the relief manual.

A special control room has been set up in collaboration with the BSNL and inquiries about the accident can be made at the following three numbers (01892) 222975, 229700 and 222133.","A tragic bus accident near Dharamsala on June 21 claimed the lives of 19 people and injured 20 others when a private bus carrying BSNL employees and their families from Vadodara fell into a gorge at Charankhud. The group was on an LTC tour to Manali when the driver, unfamiliar with the sharp curve on the hilly highway, lost control of the vehicle around 12:30 a.m. Many died due to critical injuries from hitting rocks.

The tribune ,2005-06-23 00:00:00,APHC seeks dialogue with Centre,"Srinagar, June 22
Describing the recent visit of the APHC delegation to PoK and Pakistan as an “important first step”, chairman, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, here today sought initiation of a dialogue with the Central Government for the resolution of the Kashmir issue. He held that the Hurriyat Conference was “more than satisfied” with the visit and the time was approaching for the resolution of the issue as it had entered an “important phase”.

Mirwaiz was talking to newspersons at the party headquarters at the end of a three-hour meeting of the APHC constituents this afternoon. The APHC favours an intra-Kashmir dialogue as bilateral talks and pacts between India and Pakistan did not help resolve the issue.

A five-member APHC delegation comprising Mirwaiz, Abdul Gani Bhat, Moulvi Abbas Ansari, Bilal Lone and Fazal-ul-Haq Qureshi, and JKLF chairman Mohammad Yaseen Malik, besides Mohammad Abdullah Tari of Shabir Shah’s Democratic Freedom Party (DFP), visited Pakistan from June 2 to June 16.

“We want to extend the spectrum of talks... the onus is on all, even upon us”, Mirwaiz said in reply to a question about the initiation of talks with the Government of India. “The Government of India has to decide... let them decide and inform us”, he said, adding that the APHC wanted an “immediate initiation of dialogue”. He said this had already been conveyed to the government, with which it was having an informal contact, adding that the APHC favoured to take the process forward.

It had already two rounds of talks with the NDA government and could not initiate it with the UPA government since it took over last year, for the APHC sought the Pakistan visit prior to any further talks.

Referring to the role of Kashmiris, Mirwaiz said it was for the first time that their role was “well defined” and added “the involvement of Kashmiris started formally”. Pointing towards the complexity of the Kashmir issue, he said it needed gradual steps in the right direction and held that the Centre had a “greater responsibility to contribute”. The APHC was for taking the process forward with a positive approach and the contribution of the people of Kashmir, he said. There was optimism over the continuation of the dialogue process, he commented, hoping that India and Pakistan took the people of Kashmir along.

A significant development, according to the APHC chairman, was also in the making as the European Union chapter of the Pakistan Peoples Party had proposed a meeting with the Kashmiri leaders outside Jammu and Kashmir in August. He said several leaders favoured talks at different levels in a period of two to three months. He added this was necessary for the intra-Kashmir dialogue process, even as the inter-Kashmir dialogue process was also being worked out.

It would hold talks with the people of other regions of the state, he said in reply to a question, and added that the APHC leaders had talks with two delegations from Gilgit and Baltistan during their recent Pak visit.

Commenting on the talks with leaders in PoK and Pakistan, Moulvi Umar Farooq said all of them extended support to the Hurriyat Conference. The people and leadership in PoK wanted the restoration of the integrity of Jammu and Kashmir for it was a “human problem”. He added that there was need for a formal solution without any division of Jammu and Kashmir.

“There is an unconditional support to the APHC for a political solution of the Kashmir issue and therefore, it is an important development”, Mirwaiz said.

As per a UNI report, Mirwaiz said the Hurriyat had invited political and separatist leadership of PoK to visit and assess the ground situation in Jammu and Kashmir.","Hurriyat Conference Chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, following a recent visit to Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), called for immediate dialogue with the Indian government to resolve the Kashmir issue. Terming the visit as an “important first step,” he stressed that the Kashmir dispute had entered a crucial phase, warranting intra-Kashmir dialogue rather than relying solely on bilateral India-Pakistan negotiations. The APHC delegation, which included prominent separatist leaders, received broad support during meetings in PoK and Pakistan, and Mirwaiz emphasized that Kashmiris must now play a formal role in peace efforts. Talks with delegations from Gilgit and Baltistan were also held. He said the APHC was in informal contact with the Indian government and ready for talks. An intra-Kashmir dialogue is being planned, and the Hurriyat has invited PoK leaders to visit Jammu and Kashmir to assess the situation. The APHC reiterated its opposition to any division of the state.",Politics

Life has become miserable in Punjab's countryside where various areas are being subjected to power cuts on a staggered basis lasting up to nine hours daily. Even in urban areas the situation is equally bad as consumers have to face power cuts ranging from six hours to eight hours.

There will be no relief from the agonising power cuts for the people of Punjab till the onset of the monsoon in this region. Power supply in bulk has been diverted from the industrial and domestic sectors to the agricultural sector to facilitate the transplantation of paddy. The PSEB authorities claim that they are providing power for eight hours daily to the farm sector.

Otherwise also the demand for power in the state has shot up because of the extremely hot weather conditions prevailing in the region. According to the forecast, the monsoon is expected to arrive by June 29. But it could be delayed by a few days.

Informed sources say that Punjab is buying power worth Rs 12 crore daily from various sources to deal with the crisis. Its daily demand is over 1,500 lakh units while the availability of power from all state and central sources is about 1,250 lakh units.

The PSEB is buying power at the moment even from a far-away state like Kerala. The sources say that a thermal plant in Kerala is supplying 36 lakh units. The supply is being routed from the southern grid to the eastern for further transmission to the northern grid. "" The inter-connectivity of various grids is proving to be a boon for Punjab"", said a senior PSEB officer.

Besides, the PSEB is getting 4 lakh units from the Atomic Power Plant at Kota in Rajasthan, 16 lakh units from Gujarat, an additional 20 lakh units from Himachal Pradesh and Uttaranchal, 25 lakh units from the unallocated share of the Central Government and 80 lakh units from the Nathpa Jakhri project. Over and above its share, the PSEB is buying about 250 lakh units from ""outside"" sources, it is learnt, at a cost of more than Rs 3 per unit. The PSEB is getting its full share from the Bhakra projects.

The sources say that because of transmission constraints, the PSEB cannot afford to draw more power than what it is drawing now from various sources.

There is a mandatory weekly off besides a four-hour daily power cut for industry. Urban areas are being subjected to power cuts lasting over six hours daily. Single-phase power feeders in the rural areas remain off for about nine hours.

Many farmers have delayed sowing of paddy as they have been finding it difficult to run tubewell motors on diesel-operated generator sets and hence started waiting for the power position to stabilise.

In certain pockets of Punjab, paddy, transplanted in first two weeks of this month, had started drying in absence of enough water to keep that submerged.

Not only this, the areas, getting 24-hour power supply and have started facing cuts of the duration of eight hours few weeks ago, have started facing cuts of 16 hours a day and now have been getting power for only eight hours.

Interestingly, severe power crisis in Punjab has become a blessing in disguise for those, dealing in the manufacturing and sale of diesel generator sets and inverters as they have been witnessing a huge jump in their sales compared the sales made by them in the corresponding period last year.","Punjab is facing a severe power crisis with daily power cuts lasting up to nine hours in rural areas and six to eight hours in urban regions. The crisis is driven by the diversion of electricity to the agricultural sector to support paddy transplantation amid intense summer heat. With daily demand exceeding 1,500 lakh units and supply limited to around 1,250 lakh units, the Punjab State Electricity Board (PSEB) is purchasing power worth Rs 12 crore daily from other states, including as far as Kerala. Despite these efforts, power supply remains insufficient due to transmission constraints. Farmers have been forced to delay paddy sowing or rely on diesel generators, which has led to crops beginning to dry in some areas. Meanwhile, the crisis has boosted sales of inverters and generators. Relief is not expected until the monsoon, anticipated around June 29, arrives to ease demand.",Business and Finance

The bus, as part of the Army convoy, was heavily damaged and those injured included the driver and conductor of the civilian bus carrying the jawans back to their unit around 4 pm. The troops were going back to the unit after leave when the blast took place, a defence spokesman said here. Those injured have been admitted to the 92 Base Hospital here and are in the ICU.

According to the spokesman, the explosion took place in a car laden with explosive material and parked outside the battalion headquarters of the CRPF.

Senior Congress leader and former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Digvijay Singh was today given the responsibility of the election-bound state of Bihar. He replaces Mr Harikesh Bahadur, who was the AICC in charge of the state during the last poll.

The Congress also announced the names of new Pradesh Congress Committees (PCCs) for 17 states, but there were no surprises. Except for three changes, Congress president Sonia Gandhi chose to retain the incumbent PCC chiefs for other states, including state unit president of Jammu and Kashmir Peerzada Mohammad Sayeed. However, the same has been kept pending for states like Bihar, Jharkhand, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh. The delay was being attributed to factional pulls and pressures.

Although AICC general secretary Digvijay Singh had been denying it for days, the decision on his appointment as Bihar in charge was in the offing for some time now. He is also looking after the affairs of Assam, where the incumbent Congress government is fighting hard to stay ahead in the upcoming electoral race.

Congress leaders said Mr Digvijay Singh was given charge of Bihar as he is a former Chief Minister who has dealt with several complex electoral battles in the past. Besides, new circumstances in Bihar demanded that a new person be given this responsibility.

The change, it was stated, became imperative as the ties between the Congress and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) came under severe strain during the last Assembly elections when seat-sharing negotiations handled by senior leaders Arjun Singh and M.L. Fotedar were marked by rancour and bitterness. “It was important to wipe the slate clean and begin afresh,” remarked a senior AICC leader. That Mr Digivjay Singh enjoys a good rapport with Mr Lalu Prasad Yadav is an added bonus.

Mr Digvijay Singh’s persuasive and diplomatic skills will be put to test in case of Bihar as his first task will be to prevent a split in the secular vote by bringing together LJP leader Ram Vilas Paswan and RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav. While the latter is quite amenable to a tie up with the LJP, Mr Paswan has already declared that he is not open to this offer.

Mr Digvijay Singh will have to do a tightrope walk in his seat-sharing negotiations as he will be required to drive a respectable bargain for the Congress without annoying Mr Yadav.

With organisation elections nearing completion, the process of naming new PCC chiefs, kickstarted yesterday with the appointment of Mr Ramesh Chennithala as Kerala state unit president, continued today. Although Punjab did not figure in today’s list, a change in the PCC presidentship is not being ruled out. The present PCC chief, Mr H.S.Hanspal, may be replaced with a Dalit to take on the growing clout of the Bahujan Samaj Party.

Following a one-line resolution passed by five PCCs authorising Ms Sonia Gandhi to nominate the presidents, she cleared the names of Mr Mukut Mithi (Arunachal Pradesh), Mr Salman Khursheed (UP), Ms Prabha Rau (Maharashtra), Mr B.D.Kalla (Rajasthan) and Mr Pir Zada Mohammad Sayeed (Jammu and Kashmir).

The AICC also announced PCC presidents for 12 other states, who were elected by their state units. These include Mr Keshav Rao (Andhra Pradesh) Mr Bhuvaneshwar Kalita (Assam), Mr Ravi Nayak (Goa), Mr Lalthanwala (Mizoram), Mr Hoketo Sumi (Nagaland), Mr Nar Bahadur Bhandari (Sikkim), Mr Gurudas Kamat (Mumbai Regional Congress Committee) and Mr Moosa Manikfar Kallikagothi (Lakshwadeep). The new names include Mr O.L Nongtudu (Meghalaya), Mr Kuldeep Sharma (Andaman and Nicobar) and Mr Ketan Patel ( Daman and Diu).
","Senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh has been appointed as the AICC in charge of Bihar, replacing Harikesh Bahadur. The move comes ahead of Bihar's Assembly elections and aims to reset strained alliances, especially with the RJD. Singh, known for his diplomatic skills, is tasked with uniting secular forces and negotiating seat-sharing with leaders like Lalu Prasad Yadav and Ram Vilas Paswan. The Congress also announced Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) presidents for 17 states, retaining most incumbents, while decisions for Bihar, Jharkhand, Punjab, and Himachal Pradesh were delayed due to internal factionalism.",Politics

Relations between Left parties and the UPA today touched a new low with the Communists deciding to stay away from the coordination committee meetings as the Congress-led coalition government has decided to go ahead with the disinvestment of 10 per cent of its stake in the profit-making public sector undertaking BHEL.

In a damage control exercise, Congress party spokesperson Ambika Soni said the UPA would find a way out to address the concerns of the Left parties.

Terming the Manmohan Singh government’s disinvestment move as “a serious breach of promises made in the common minimum programme (CMP)”, which forms the basis of Left parties’ outside support to the coalition, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat said “the government is going ahead with its policy decisions contrary to the CMP, despite our protests”.

“No useful purpose will be served in attending meetings of the coordination committee. Therefore we have decided to regretfully suspend our participation in the coordination committee,” he said, after the leaders of the four Left parties — CPI(M), CPI, Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) and All-India Forward Bloc, — met this morning to finalise their strategy.

“Nothing is beyond resolution. It can be resolved and it will be resolved. There was no question of anyone taking anyone else for granted and doors and windows of UPA leaders are not closed,” Congress spokesperson said.

The Left leaders, who have written a letter to UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi in this regard, however, ruled out any immediate move to withdraw support to the UPA government.

The four Left parties have over 60 MPs in the Lok Sabha and are crucial to the government’s survival.

The Left leaders gave indications that the dialogue process with the UPA would continue.

When asked whether the Left would suspend all dialogue process with the UPA government, Mr Karat said, “Normal dialogue process between the political parties would continue. Only we are suspending our participation in the coordination committee”.

The committee was set up following a demand by the Left parties to avoid confrontations and confusion regarding the government’s policies and key decisions.

Anticipating a “strong political message” from the Left parties during the Sunday meeting Prime Minister met veteran Marxist leader Harkishen Singh Surjeet last night as a damage control exercise.

Asked what transpired at the meeting, Mr Karat said Mr Manmohan Singh wanted to “know what the problem was” and why the Left parties were upset.

“We had asked the government not to proceed with this disinvestment as the CMP had clearly stated that UPA will retain the existing navratna companies in the public sector while these companies can go to the capital market to raise resources, if required,” Mr Karat said.

He said the Finance Minister has set a target of realising Rs 10,000 crore through disinvestment in the Union Budget for 2005-06.

Mr Karat said indications were that the government was considering disinvesting its stakes in around 20 other PSUs, although the Prime Minister had stated in October that “no such scheme is in the offing”.

CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan said the Left parties feared the government was not only intending to disinvest in BHEL but also NTPC, ONGC and other navaratnas and profit-making PSUs.

“We cannot understand or accept this interpretation of difference between 51 per cent and 49 per cent disinvestment,” Mr Bardhan said, adding that any change in the equity structure could alter the character of the PSUs.

Without naming Finance Minister P. Chidambaram, the CPI leader said, “this particular senior minister is also careful in saying that our government will not do it beyond 49 per cent. He is leaving it to the future government to dispose of the remaining 2 per cent”.

He said the CMP clearly stated that the navratna companies should be retained in the public sector while raising resources from the market. “There is no scope for misunderstanding here. The navratnas like BHEL can go to the market for raising the capital for their own needs and it is not for the government to sell their shares and appropriate those proceeds.’’

“The proposal for a national investment fund is merely a mechanism to facilitate the government in appropriating the proceeds of disinvestment,” they alleged.

Party national secretary D. Raja, AIFB chief Debabrata Biswas and RSP central committee member Abani Roy also attended the meeting.

They also discussed the strategy for the proposed countrywide protest against the oil price hike on June 28.","Tensions escalated between the Left parties and the UPA government after the latter decided to disinvest 10% of its stake in BHEL, a profit-making PSU. Terming it a violation of the Common Minimum Programme, the Left parties announced suspension of their participation in the UPA-Left coordination committee, though they stopped short of withdrawing support. CPM leader Prakash Karat criticized the disinvestment policy, expressing concerns about potential stake sales in other PSUs like NTPC and ONGC. Congress sought damage control, with PM Manmohan Singh reaching out to Left leaders. The Left will continue broader dialogue but plans protests against the decision.

An unprecedented rise in temperatures — reaching upto 33 degrees in this area — seems to have caused the ice caps in this remote Himalayan region to melt thus rapidly bringing down torrents of water causing devastation in these areas in the last 24 hours.

It has been confirmed that the flood had been brought by water coming down the Spiti river which joins the Sutlej at Khab, about 160 km away.

The swirling waters could have been the result of fast melting of ice caps in India as well as Tibet. The day time temperatures rose to an unprecedented 33 degrees Celsius in the area in the last week. The peaks in this region had witnessed a high level of snow last winter and excess melt was expected.

Interestingly, the Pareechu river, where a lake was formed last year when a landslide blocked the river’s path, feeds the Spiti.

Even as the official machinery is working to find out the cause, a flooded Sutlej has left the crucial Hindustan — Tibet road punctured at several places in Rampur and Kinnaur. The damage may take more than four months to repair said an official of the Border Roads Organisation working to cut a mountain to make way for the vehicles to pass just 5 km short of Rampur.

The movement of vehicles has been hit. About 500 tourists are stranded. Some of them have been caught at locations where the vehicles cannot move either way as the road has been washed away on both sides. In Rampur and just north of it, a raging Sutlej has washed away homes, trees and shops. Drinking water supply lines have been damaged.

The river rose by 40 feet yesterday washing away everything. Water also entered homes in Braugh across Rampur on the right bank of the river.

Kushal Deep Verma of Rampur said: “The bridge between Rampur and Jagat Khana has been washed away. Reports reaching here said water also entered the Samdoh camp of the Army last evening. This is the last village on the Indian side.

The Natpha-Jhakri power project located 25 km upstream on the Sutlej is closed since Saturday evening. The machines and turbines are safe but cannot be started as the silt level in the water is 30,000 particles per million (PPM). This needs to be 5,000 PPM or less to operate the turbines. The General Manager, Mr J.K. Sharma, said “We cannot say when the silt level will go down to start the 1500 megawatt project.”

This was the second major flood in Sutlej, the last one being in August 2002 when 25 bridges were washed away and more than 100 persons died.","Unprecedented heat reaching 33°C in the Himalayan region around Rampur has triggered rapid melting of ice caps, causing severe flooding from the Spiti river into the Sutlej. The flood, likely exacerbated by melting in Tibet and a blocked river at Pareechu, has damaged the crucial Hindustan–Tibet road, stranding 500 tourists and washing away infrastructure, homes, and water supply lines. The Sutlej rose by 40 feet, submerging villages and Army camps. The 1500 MW Nathpa Jhakri power project remains shut due to excessive silt in the water. Officials estimate road repairs may take over four months.

Speaking at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington think tank, yesterday Mr Mukherjee said the infrastructure for terrorism in Pakistan and Pakistan-controlled territory still exists.

“We do not hear of operations like the ones being conducted by Pakistan in cooperation with the USA against the war on terrorism at its western frontiers towards its eastern borders with India,” he said.

Asked whether infiltrations from Pakistan had stopped, Mr Mukherjee said these had reduced. “We have to keep our fingers crossed,” he cautioned, adding that the Himalayan passes are yet to open after the snows melt. “The people to people contact has created an atmosphere where terrorists are isolated,” he said.

Peace with Pakistan would also be beneficial for Afghanistan and Central Asia, the minister said. Noting that Afghanistan needs economic support, markets and assistance, Mr Mukherjee said while India had made modest contributions in Afghanistan it could do a lot more if normal relations and trade and transit through Pakistan could flourish.

New Delhi is concerned about signs of resurgence of the Taliban and the growth in drug cultivation and trafficking in Afghanistan.

Mr Mukherjee also made the case for a permanent seat for India on the United Nations Security Council.

Discussing what he called India’s “global decision-making deficit,” he said the world had changed dramatically since the constitution of the United Nations and its present composition of Security Council members.

“The Cold War structure of global governance stands dismantled, but an enduring replacement that can address the economic and security challenges of our times and the future is not in place.”

Pointing out that a unipolar world is clearly not a sustainable proposition in the long run, Mr Mukherjee said India favoured a “partnership among the nations.” New Delhi’s partnership with Brazil, Japan and Germany for a permanent seat on the Security Council was just one example of this partnership.

Mr Mukherjee said India was a “natural candidate” for a permanent seat on the Security Council “by any criteria — size, population, economy, military power, role in international peacekeeping, responsibility in international affairs, future prospects.”","Defence Minister Pranab Mukherjee, speaking at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington, acknowledged positive developments in Indo-Pak relations but cautioned that the peace process was not yet entrenched. He highlighted ongoing terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and noted that infiltration had reduced but cautioned against premature optimism. Mukherjee emphasized the benefits of improved Indo-Pak ties for Afghanistan and Central Asia. He also stressed India's support for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council, citing global governance deficits and India's qualifications, including population, economy, and peacekeeping role. He advocated for a multipolar global order based on international partnerships.",International News

The tribune ,2005-06-30 00:00:00,"India, US sign 10-yr defence agreement Ashish Kumar Sen writes from Washington","INDIA and the USA on Tuesday entered into an agreement that “charts a course for the US-Indo defence relationship for the next 10 years”. The landmark agreement will facilitate joint weapons production, co-operation on missile defence and the transfer of technology.

The document, signed in Washington by US Defence Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and Indian Defence Minister Pranab Mukherjee, seeks “new opportunities for technology transfer, collaboration, co-production and research and development.”

“The United States and India have entered a new era,” a statement issued after the signing of the agreement said. “We are transforming our relationship to reflect our common principles and shared national interests.”

The Indian and US sides agreed to set up a new subgroup — “defence procurement and production group” — to oversee defence trade, as well as prospects for co-production and technology collaboration. A newly constituted Defence Joint Working Group, subordinate to the Defence Policy Group (DPG) will meet at least once every year to review the work overseen by DPG and its subgroups.

Noting that the two nations had advanced to “unprecedented levels of cooperation” since 1995, when the two countries signed the “Agreed Minute on Defence Relations,” the statement said the defence relationship would be part of the broader US-Indo strategic partnership.

In January 1995, US Defence Secretary William Perry signed the “Agreed Minute on Defence Relations” with his Indian counterpart, S. B. Chavan. However, the Clinton administration’s preoccupation with questions of nuclear non-proliferation had inhibited any significant expansion of military-to-military cooperation or dual-use technology transfers.

According to the agreement signed on Tuesday, the USA and India “will work to conclude defence transactions, not solely as ends in and of themselves, but as a means to strengthen our countries’ security, reinforce our strategic partnership, achieve greater interaction between our armed forces, and build greater understanding between our defence establishments.”

It noted that since the last Agreed Minute “changes in the international security environment have challenged our countries in ways unforeseen 10 years ago.” The agreement defined its goals as strengthening “our countries’ security, reinforce our strategic partnership, and build greater understanding between our defence establishments.”

“Both sides agreed that US-India defence relations are an important pillar of their transforming bilateral relationship,” the statement said. “Today, we agree on a new framework that builds on past successes, seizes new opportunities and charts a course for the US-Indo defence relationship for the next 10 years.”

The framework stated that both India and the US were entering a new era, “transforming our relationships to reflect our common principles and shared national interests.”

It added that the two sides would expand interaction with other nations in ways that promote regional and global peace and stability, and enhance capabilities to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

Speaking at the release of a report of the Joint Task Force of the Pacific Council on International Policy and Observer Research Foundation at the Brookings Institution on Tuesday, Mr Mukherjee lauded the contribution of the Indian American community to the US-India ties.

US-India relations, he said, have been nourished by a “highly professional relationship in which Indians who have settled in the US have made a huge contribution.”

“Today, when the relationship changes as the report has described, ‘from uneasy cooperation to incipient partnership, it would be fair to recognize the role played by those in the strategic community as well as the range of Indian professionals who have contributed to this re-evaluation of India and the US-India relations,” he added.

Key members of the task force include former Indian ambassador to the US, Abid Hussain, former US ambassador to India, Richard F. Celeste, and former Indian Army Chief of Staff Gen V.P. Malik.

The task force’s report recommended removing barriers to strategic cooperation, particularly in the area of technology development, and expansion of commercial ties between India and the USA.

Mr Mukherjee had made a similar recommendation himself in a speech to a Washington think tank on Monday in which he appealed to the Bush administration to remove “anachronistic” restrictions on dual use nuclear and space technology cooperation.

The minister said the task force’s recommendations were “particularly timely” on the eve of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s July 18-20 visit to the United States “which we hope will be a prelude to President Bush’s visit to India, the first after President Clinton’s visit in March 2000.”

Under increasing pressure from India and other countries, Nepal’s King Gyanendra today lifted the state of emergency imposed after he grabbed power on February 1. But it was not clear if Press censorship and ban on political activities had also been removed.

“His Majesty in accordance with the constitution has lifted the order of the state of emergency,” a brief Royal Palace statement said, hours after the King’s return from a three-nation tour, where leaders pressed him for restoration of democracy in the kingdom.

The King, who visited Indonesia, China and Singapore, had assured Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in Jakarta last week on the sidelines of the Afro-Asian summit that he would initiate steps for early restoration of multi-party democracy. Despite the King’s assurance, deposed Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba was arrested on corruption charges on Wednesday.

The Royal announcement did not make any mention of the restoration of Press freedom and removal of ban on political activities.

Political parties welcomed the monarch’s decision but said this was not enough as hundreds of political activists continued in detention. They asked the King to restore the constitution and return all executive powers to people’s representatives.

Notwithstanding the withdrawal of the state of emergency, public meetings and demonstrations would not be allowed in most of the places in Kathmandu.

The ban on FM and private radio stations to broadcast news, views and information continued and Nepal’s cable operators were still not allowed to air Indian news channels. Under Nepal’s constitution, the state of emergency would have expired on Sunday, three months after it came into force.

The state of emergency was lifted as per Article 115 (11) of the constitution, effective from midnight, the Royal Palace said.

Meanwhile, Nepali Congress president Girija Prasad Koirala alleged that the lifting of emergency by the King was a move to “deceive” the international community, which is exerting tremendous pressure on Nepal to revive democracy.

He demanded the formation of an all-party government and reinstatement of parliament to resolve the current political stalemate.

Welcoming the King’s announcement, Nepali Congress (Democratic) acting president Gopal Man Shrestha said the Royal Commission for Corruption Control (RCCC) formed by the King should be abolished with the termination of emergency.

The King should return all executive powers to people’s representatives and the constitution should be restored, he said.","Nepal's King Gyanendra lifted the state of emergency imposed after his power grab on February 1, following pressure from India and other nations. However, the announcement did not clarify if press censorship or the ban on political activities had been revoked. Political parties welcomed the move but criticized it as insufficient, demanding restoration of democracy, release of detained activists, and reinstatement of parliament. Former PM Sher Bahadur Deuba's recent arrest raised further concerns. Public gatherings remain restricted, and media limitations continue. Critics, including Nepali Congress leader G.P. Koirala, accused the King of trying to mislead the international community.

In an attempt to put at rest a wave of speculation over a change of leadership in the BJP, sparked off by BJP vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi’s statement yesterday, former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee today said the next elections would be fought under Mr L.K. Advani’s leadership.

“Mr Advani will surely be there. The next poll will be fought under his leadership”, Mr Vajpayee said here this afternoon while talking to newspersons after addressing the BJP Mahila Morcha’s national executive meeting.

Mr Vajpayee was asked by the media to clarify on what Mr Naqvi had meant by leadership of the new generation.

“There is nothing extraordinary in Mr Naqvi’s statement. Change of leadership in a party is a common thing. Leadership keeps changing and old leaders make way for the new”, he said.

Mr Vajpayee reached here this morning to attend the national executive meeting of the BJP Mahila Morcha. Addressing the meeting, he said reservation for women would be an important poll agenda in the future. “ The Congress is not talking about it now since its allies are against the Women Reservation Bill but we will fight for the issue “, he said. He also spoke about social evils like infanticide and child marriage.

Among the state leaders present at the meeting were Mr Kalyan Singh, Mr Lalji Tandon, Mr Keshrinath Tripathi and national president of the Mahila Morcha Karuna Shukla.

Yesterday, Mr Naqvi had announced in Rampur that the next poll would be fought under the leadership of a new-generation leader. He had made this statement while attending a jan panchayet at Bilaspur near Rampur town, his former parliamentary constituency.

Asked if he was in the race for the new leader he was talking about, Mr Naqvi had clarified that “I am not in the race. The party has capable second-rung leaders who will spearhead the party campaign in the next General Election”, he had said.

Mr Naqvi’s statement, coming in the wake of RSS chief K. Sudarshan’s observation on the need for a change in leadership, had sparked off a furore in the party rank and file yesterday. He later had to issue a modified statement, saying that Mr Advani would take a final decision on the leadership issue.","Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee clarified that the BJP would contest the next general election under L.K.

The tribune ,2005-05-03 00:00:00,"No tax on savings cash withdrawals IT limit for women, senior citizens raised","New Delhi, May 2
The government today modified the controversial proposal of 0.1 per cent tax on cash withdrawals sparing the savings accounts holders from the taxman’s scalpel, whittled down the contentious fringe benefit tax, and raised the tax exemption limit for women and senior citizens.

Under the amendments introduced in the Finance Bill 2005, which was passed by voice vote in the Lok Sabha today, the tax on cash withdrawal will be applicable only to current account holders and raised the threshold limit Rs 25,000 from the earlier proposed Rs 10,000 for individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs). In case of companies the threshold limit shall be Rs 1 lakh.

Effectively, this means that business, firms and institutions will have to pay a 0.1 per cent tax only if they withdraw Rs 1 lakh or more in a single day from their current accounts. Similar threshold limits have been fixed for term deposits as well. In other words, an individual or a HUF would be liable to pay a tax of 0.1 per cent only if the value of the fixed deposit which is redeemed is more than Rs 25,000 while for companies it would be Rs one lakh or more. However, no tax would be levied, if the amount after maturity of term deposits is transferred to the account holders in the same bank.

The new tax proposals on banking cash transactions will come into force from June 1, 2005.

Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said exempting savings accounts from banking cash transaction tax would mean that most of the people go out of this tax net. The aim of the cash transaction tax is to maintain a tax trail as there are evidence of a non-tax payer depositing from Rs 1 crore to Rs 98 crore and withdrawing cash ranging from Rs 23 crore to Rs 623 crore. “The idea behind this tax is to ensure that banks are not used for money laundering by keeping a tax trail,” the Finance Minister said.

The Finance Minister also sought to blunt the Opposition criticism about providing only lip service to the fairer sex and elderly and announced further relief to women and senior citizens. He raised the income tax exemption limit for women by another Rs 10,000 to Rs 1,35,000 and for senior citizens by additional Rs 35,000 to Rs 1,85,000.

The corresponding income tax rates for women and senior citizens have also been revised. Under the revised structure women earning less than Rs1,35,000 will not be liable to pay any tax; earnings between Rs 1,35,000 and Rs 1,50,000 will attract 10 per cent tax; between Rs 1,50,000 and Rs 2,50,000 will attract 20 per cent and women earning more than Rs 2,50,000 will come under the 30 per cent income tax bracket.

Similarly, citizens who earn less than Rs 1,85,000, would not have to pay any taxes, while those earning between Rs 1,85,000 and Rs 2,50,000 will come under the 20 per cent tax slab and income beyond Rs 2,50,000 would attract 30 per cent tax

The proposed FBT, which have attracted a lot of flak from the corporate world, have been retained, although in a whittled down format. Mr Chidambaram diluted provisions of the Fringe Benefits tax on employers exempting expenditure on advertisement and other sales promotions such as business conventions and sports sponsorship from the ambit of the contentious tax.

A significant reduction has also been announced in FBT. For industries such as hotels, pharmaceuticals, computer software and construction, the FBT rate has been slashed down to 5 per cent from the earlier proposed 25 per cent.

Expenditure on sales promotion through advertisement of any form in any print or electronic media or transport system, holding or participation in any press conference or business convention, exhibition, signs, art work, painting banners etc will not be considered as expenditure on sales promotion, including publicity

In addition, expenditure incurred on payment of food or beverages provided by the employer to his employees in office or factory and expenditure on payment through paid vouchers which are not transferable and usable only at eating joints or outlets will not be treated as FBT

Expenditure on employees welfare will attract FBT but not the expenditure incurred or payment made to fulfil any statutory obligation or mitigate occupational hazard on provide first aid facilities in hospital or dispensary run by employers.

Other expenditures that will come under FBT are conveyance, tour and travel including foreign travel, use of hotel, boarding and lodging facilities, repair, running, maintenance of motor cars and aircraft and the amount depreciation on them. Use of telephone including mobile phone will attract FBT but expenditure on leased telephone line will be exempt. Maintenance of any accommodation like guest house except those used for training purposes, festival celebrations, use of health club and similar facilities, use of any other club facilities, gifts and scholarships will come under the scanner of FBT.

Amendments have also been brought about in the some of the indirect tax proposals and Mr Chidambaram reduced the excise duty on molasses from Rs 1,000 per tonne to Rs 750 and the countervailing duty on import of nylon nets for tuna fishing from 15 per cent to five.

The Finance Minister also exempted the premium under the farm insurance scheme from service tax on grounds that premium under similar scheme — national agriculture insurance scheme — has already been exempted from it.

He also extended the 7 per cent customs duty on laptops to all other computer imports like monitor, computer processing unit and mouse, and exempted 4 per cent countervailing duty on components for mobile phone manufacturing in India.

Excise duty on isolated soya protein has been reduced from 16 per cent to 8 per cent as it is an important source of protein.","The Finance Bill 2005, passed in the Lok Sabha, introduced significant tax modifications.

The NDA's resolve to continue with the boycott of the two Houses of Parliament appears to be weakening amid growing differences within the alliance on the issue and a fresh appeal from Lok Sabha Speaker to its chairman and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to reconsider the decision.

Top leaders of the opposition alliance today decided to meet again tomorrow to review their current strategy in both Houses. After participating in the discussions on the Finance Bill in the Lok Sabha yesterday, a meeting of the NDA Parliamentary Party this morning, chaired by Mr Vajpayee, had decided to continue with its protest in both Houses till the time the ""Opposition is allowed to raise its voice on issues like corruption"".

With the TDP, which extends outside support to the NDA, showing reluctance in joining the protest on the ground that it wanted to raise several issues pertaining to Andhra Pradesh, the NDA top brass swung into action and ""convinced"" it to support the move, alliance sources pointed out.

However, as the day proceeded, the TDP apparently hinted that it may not be able to support the boycott beyond a couple of more days, which was indicated by the absence of party leader Yerran Naidu from NDA meetings since last evening.

JD (U) member Prabhunath Singh also told TV channels that NDA should reconsider its stand, which senior party leader Sharad Yadav termed as a ""personal view"".

A fresh appeal from Speaker Somnath Chatterjee to Mr Vajpayee to reconsider the boycott with an assurance that ""permissible issues"" would be allowed to be raised prompted the coordination committee meeting, held in the evening under Opposition Leader L K Advani, to defer a final decision till tomorrow.

Sources said while the BJP leaders want the boycott to continue, there is a growing section within the alliance partners who want to end the impasse.

The NDA leaders met again in the evening to take stock of the latest situation and held the view that they would not return to the House till there was a ''positive indication'' from the government.

The NDA MPs will meet again tomorrow to decide if they want to continue the boycott.

Defence Minister Pranab Mukherjee today said the Justice S.N. Phukan Commission, probing defence deals, had not only visited Pune and Ahmednagar but also Ajanta and Ellora in 2003, going against the prescribed rules for use of IAF’s VIP aircraft.

Responding to clarifications in the Rajya Sabha, after he made identical statements in the two Houses, Mr Mukherjee said he was not passing any value judgement about use of service aircraft for carrying the Commission. “It is not for me to sit on judgement but for people to see. I am duty-bound to give the factual position,” he said. Mr Mukherjee said some members had stated in the House that an investigating agency or commission does not take hospitality of persons whose role was being probed.

Describing reflections made on Justice Venkatswami, who was earlier probing the Tehelka expose, as “unfortunate,” the Minister said “we should be careful while making reflections.” He said Justice Venkatswami resigned from the Tehelka Commission of Inquiry immediately after the “unfortunate” reflections were made.

Mr Mukherjee said Justice Phukan Commission was not given an extension after it was found that it was taking “unusual time.” He said the entire Tehelka matter had been referred to the CBI.

Mr Mukherjee said report of a news magazine about the VIP aircraft having been used to carry Justice Phukan Commision was “factually correct.”

He said Commission, looking into 14 items related to the Ministry of Defence, had availed the facility on being allowed by the then Defence Minister.

He said the instructions regarding the use of the VIP aircraft by the Phukan Commission were issued by the Defence Ministry after a request in this regard was approved on December 22, 2003 by then Defence Minister George Fernandes.

In view of Justice Phukan’s visit to Pune, Ahmednagar, Mumbai and Bangalore along with eight other officials and members of the Commission, to inspect the items, the order was issued to Service Headquarters and officers concerned in the Ministry of Defence on December 16, 2003, Mr Mukherjee said.

A request was then made to Service Headquarters to prepare a detailed programme and to send it to the Ministry by December 19, 2003. Air Headquarters moved the Joint Secretary (G/Air) on December 17 to seek the approval of the then Defence Minister for providing the service aircraft.

Justice Phukan along with his wife and eight officers undertook the visit by the Service Aircraft (AVRO) to Pune and from there visited Ahmednagar by an IAF chopper. They also visited Ajanta and Ellora, he said. He said the Commission did not include experts in its visit to various places where defence equipment was to be inspected.

The journey from Pune to Mumbai was made by an IL-76 transport aircraft, Mr Mukherjee said. The Commission visited the Shirdi Shrine from Ahmednagar on December 24, 2003, by road, the Minister added.

He said the Commission had used the aircraft which the President, Prime Minister and Vice President were entitled to use. He said some other dignitaries, including the Defence Minister and Home Minister, were also entitled to use the VIP aircraft, if it was essential and if the plane was available.

“It is expected that except the President, the Vice-President and the Prime Minister, other users will use the commercial services on official duty, wherever possible,” he said.

Pointing out that entitled persons had to pay for the use if the journey was not for defence purposes, he said the Congress had paid Rs 5 crore for use of the VIP aircraft by the Prime Minister. He said it was to be examined who will pay for the use of aircraft for carrying Justice Phukan and officers of the commission.

The tribune,2005-05-06 00:00:00,PM puts Opposition on the mat TDP ends boycott,"New Delhi, May 5
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh took the wind out of the sails of the Opposition stressing that there was a world of difference in what they say and what they do.

Dr Singh also stoutly objected to the Opposition charges that the government tried to prevent Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf from calling on former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

""I would like to point out the type of language the NDA and its responsible members have used against me in the memorandum they have submitted to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam....in which absolutely false things have been said,"" the Prime Minister said. He dismissed the accusations as totally false and felt pained that ""this is the length to which the Opposition goes...""

Maintaining that neither he nor the UPA government can be faulted for want of trying in ending the impasse connected with the Opposition boycott, Dr Singh pointed out that as soon as the NDA announced the boycott he spoke to BJP President L K Advani, Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Jaswant Singh and NDA Chairperson Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

Taking exception to TDP's statement that despite the government's ""vindictive and hostile"" attitude they had decided to call off the boycott of Parliament to raise issues of national public importance, the Prime Minister regretted that the allegation ""in my humble submission is not borne out by facts.""

Mr Naidu said that the UPA government should treat the Opposition as friends and not enemies.

Dr Singh's sharp rebuttal in the Rajya Sabha today added to the problems to an already embarrassed NDA with the regional TDP deciding to break free from the Opposition boycott by returning to both the Houses of Parliament a day after the coalition resolved to continue the boycott for the rest of the Budget session which concludes on May 13.

At the same time the Prime Minister appealed to all the leaders of the Opposition to be serious and cooperate in conducting the business of the Lok Sabha as well as the Rajya Sabha. ""The government is prepared to discuss all issues and there is no issue which I think is barred from discussion in the House,"" Dr Singh said.

The fissures in the NDA on the boycott issue became apparent as barely 24 hours back the NDA took pains to project unanimity.

""While condemning the vindictive and hostile attitude of the government, we would like to participate in the parliamentary proceedings under protest,"" TDP's parliamentary party leader K Yerran Naidu submitted in the Lok Sabha. ""We decided to attend the proceedings to raise matters of public importance,"" he added.

The Opposition's ire is focussed on the government and the Prime Minister who rejected their demand to drop Union Railway Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav from the Cabinet.

Expressing deep disappointment at the Opposition's continuing boycott, Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee said he had ""almost every day"" requested their MPs to participate in the proceedings and had promised to allow a discussion on all the issues permitted under the rules","Prime Minister Manmohan Singh countered the Opposition’s accusations in the Rajya Sabha, stating their charges were baseless and that the UPA had made sincere efforts to end the parliamentary boycott. He criticized the language used by the NDA in a memorandum to President Kalam and denied any attempt to block a meeting between President Musharraf and former PM Vajpayee. Meanwhile, the TDP broke ranks with the NDA boycott, choosing to return to Parliament to raise public issues. Singh urged Opposition cooperation, asserting no topic was off-limits for discussion, while Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee expressed disappointment over the continued boycott.

The tribune ,2005-05-07 00:00:00,CAG raps NDA govt Picks holes in sale of Centaur Hotels,"New Delhi, May 6
A day after former Disinvestment Minister Arun Shourie dared the government to hold an open inquiry into the sale of two Centaur hotels sale, the Comptroller and Auditor General today presented its report which could snowball into another major controversy for the previous NDA government.

The CAG in its report presented in Parliament said that the sale of two Centaur hotels took place without the benefit of competition and that valuation and reserve prices in these transactions were not consistent to the practice followed by Disinvestment Ministry in other cases.

The report said that the sale of transactions of the Juhu Centaur and Airport Centaur hotels were finalised on the basis of single bids without the benefit of competition. “The efforts made to balance the need and urgency to sell the properties and to obtain the best possible price from the sale were not evident,” the report said.

Finance Minister P. Chidambaram had on Wednesday accused former Disinvestment Minister Arun Shourie of taking an “active interest” in the sale of Juhu Centaur Hotel. The government would await the CAG report on it, he had said.

Meanwhile Mr Arun Shourie reiterated that he was ready to face any inquiry in the sale of the hotels. He said he was ready to face any inquiry that the Prime Minister or Finance Minister might deem fit. “Even though the CAG has taken a view contrary to the view of the government on technicalities and procedure, I reiterate my offer to face any inquiry that the PM or the FM may deem fit,” he said.

The former minister said that an interesting feature that did not find mention in the CAG report was that at some stage the valuation of the Centaur hotel was put at Rs 246 crore but was mysteriously brought down to Rs 101 crore.

The CAG, in a severe criticism of the procedure and valuation process, said, “Assumptions made during valuation of the properties and fixation of reserve price of Airport Centuar were not consistent with the practice followed by the ministry in other cases. Repeated extensions and relaxation were allowed to the bidder of Juhu Cenaur to facilitate the sale,” it observed.

“Various relaxations allowed to the bidder and interventions by the ministry to facilitate the sale indicated inadequate efforts to mitigate the risk of transaction in a limited competition scenario,” the report said.

The CAG said expressions of interest were received in October 2000 from 20 parties for Juhu Centaur and 21 parties for Airport Centaur.","The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India has raised serious concerns over the sale of two Centaur hotels during the NDA regime, stating the transactions lacked competition and followed inconsistent valuation practices. The Juhu and Airport Centaur hotels were sold based on single bids, with questionable reductions in reserve price and special relaxations granted to bidders. Finance Minister P. Chidambaram earlier accused former Disinvestment Minister Arun Shourie of playing an active role in the Juhu Centaur sale. Shourie reiterated his willingness to face any inquiry. The CAG’s findings may trigger a political controversy for the former NDA government.

The Election Commission was mired in a fresh controversy today when Railway Minister Lalu Prasad demanded immediate resignation of Election Commissioners B.B. Tandon and N. Gopalaswamy, who were accused by a senior IAS official of having made every attempt to countermand the poll in the Chapra Lok Sabha constituency last year.

“The Election Commission should be reconstituted and Mr Tandon and Mr Gopalaswamy must resign,” Lalu Prasad told a hurriedly called press conference where he distributed letter purported to have been written by L.V. Saptharishi, who was Special Observer in Bihar during the Lok Sabha poll, to Law Minister H.R. Bhardwaj.

Belonging to the West Bengal cadre, Mr Saptharishi is at present Director-General of the Council for Advancement of People’s Action and Rural Technology (CAPART).

In view of the serious nature of accusations, the two must resign and the Election Commission reconstituted so that the prestige of the august organisation is not lowered, Lalu Prasad said alleging that the commissioners had conspired to prevent him from entering the Parliament. His party would raise the issue in the Parliament, he added.

“My conscience will not permit me to keep quiet and hence I am writing this letter to inform you that the appointment of Mr Tandon as the Chief Election Commissioner and continuation of Mr Gopalaswamy as the Election Commissioner would be extremely undesirable in the interest of fair play, justice and democracy and impartial conduct of future elections,” Mr Saptharishi said.

There was no reaction from the Election Commission on the charges levelled by the official. Mr Tandon is slated to take over as the Chief Election Commissioner on May 16.

In the letter to Mr Bharadwaj yesterday, Mr Saptharishi, who is to retire in a few months time, said although nothing extraordinary or abnormal happened at Chapra, where then Union Civil Aviation Minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy of the BJP had crossed swords with Lalu Prasad, every attempt was made by Mr Tandon and Mr Gopalaswamy to countermand the poll after listening to the “unreasonable demands” of L.K. Advani (the then Home Minister), Mr Rudy and others.

The letter alleged that when Mr Saptharishi reached Delhi after the poll, the two Election Commissioners told him they wanted to “teach Lalu Prasad and all Yadavs a lesson as no Yadav can be trusted.”","Railway Minister Lalu Prasad demanded the resignation of Election Commissioners B.B. Tandon and N. Gopalaswamy, accusing them of attempting to countermand the Chapra Lok Sabha poll to block his entry into Parliament. He cited a letter from senior IAS officer L.V.

The tribune ,2005-05-09 00:00:00,India not to insist on veto power,"Moscow, May 8
Even as Russia has affirmed its support to India in an expanded United Nations Security Council at a ‘very high level’, India is not holding on to a veto and ‘if there is no veto at all, New Delhi will be happy with that as well’.

What India is desirous of in principle is to move towards greater democratisation of the United Nations on the basis of non-discrimination with greater participation of developing countries in the decision-making process, according to Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran.

He said this here aboard Air India One carrying Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on his three-day visit to the Russian Federation for the 60th anniversary celebrations of the Great Patriotic War.

“A reformed and expanded UNSC has become necessary to meet the global challenges that calls for multilateral action while controlling one’s own destiny,” he said.

“India is realistic that the challenges before the world body are complex and it for the first time in many years that certain momentum for reforms has been built. There is a certain window of opportunity and it is necessary to safeguard the interests of the developing world,” Mr Saran observed.

Pointing out that the G-4 (India, Japan, Germany and Brazil) has played an extremely important role in this regard, he said this grouping was not fixated on the veto issue even as the P-5 is against providing any additional veto in an expanded Security Council.

“We will have to see how the framework resolution is evolved as well as the negotiations on the membership issue. New Delhi has been lobbying with the developing countries as well as in Africa and Latin America,” he said.

He said the Prime Minister had specially come to Moscow to recognise the sacrifices and to pay India’s tribute to the millions of people and soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice in protecting their liberty and right to live from the marauding Hitlerlism thus ending the World War II.

Much significance is attached to Dr Singh’s bilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin tomorrow in the midst of the celebrations when the two leaders are expected to review the progress achieved on various fronts for 30 minutes after the latter’s visit to India in December last year.

Mr Putin and Dr Singh are expected to discuss energy, security and further investments in the oil and gas sector in the country, upgrading defence R and D and joint production, providing Indian software in banking and probably the oil and gas sector and moving towards a government-to-government intellectual property rights agreement, observed India’s ambassador to Moscow.","During Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s visit to Moscow for Russia’s WWII victory celebrations, Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran stated that India supports a reformed and expanded United Nations Security Council (UNSC) with increased participation from developing nations. India, along with G-4 partners (Japan, Germany, Brazil), is not fixated on securing veto power and would accept an expansion without new vetoes. Russia reaffirmed its high-level support for India's bid. Singh is also set to meet President Vladimir Putin to discuss bilateral cooperation in energy, defence, IT, and intellectual property. The visit underscores India's strategic relationship with Russia and its global governance priorities.

The tribune ,2005-05-10 00:00:00,EC takes Chhapra to Kalam Got no letter: Bhardwaj,"New Delhi, May 9
Chief Election Commissioner T.S. Krishna Murthy accompanied by two Commissioners B.B. Tandon and N Gopalswami today met President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam in the wake of allegations made by senior IAS officer L.V. Saptarishi in countermanding Chhapra Lok Sabha polls.

EC sources said the poll panel submitted a copy of the report submitted by the special poll observer Saptarishi, the Commission’s reason for appointing a two-member team to probe electoral malpractice in the parliamentary segment and reasons for countermanding the polls. They also submitted the speaking report of the poll panel.

They also submitted a report dismissing the allegations of casteism levelled by Saptarishi, sources added.

Sources said Saptarishi in his report had suggested that repoll could be ordered in 172 polling booths even though the District Magistrate in his report had suggested repoll in 89 polling stations.

Further, the report indicated that both the BJP and the RJD indulged in booth capturing in the parliamentary segment.

Sources said the RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav, when he appeared before the Commission, reportedly stated that the inquiry team of the poll panel had “given a clean” chit to the party and there was no need for countermanding the polls.

This, sources said, clearly indicated that the RJD chief had been privy to the information given to the EC.

The two-member inquiry team of the EC after examining the records concluded that there had been large scale and systematic rigging and suggested countermanding of elections.

Though the CEC’s meeting was meant to be a “farewell call”, the issue cropped up and the three Commissioners explained their position during the 30-minute meeting. Krishnamurthy retires on May 16 and Tandon will take charge as CEC the same day.

The EC had yesterday termed “scurrious and baseless” Saptarishi’s allegations.

Saptharishi alleged Tandon and Gopalaswami had put pressure to countermand the poll in Chhapra contested by RJD supremo and Railway Minister Lalu Prasad and the then Civil Aviation Minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy.

The EC had contended the full Commission passed a unanimous quasi-judicial order on May 10 last year setting out in detail the reasons for countermanding Chapra elections.

PTI adds: In a new twist to the controversy, Union Law Minister H.R. Bhardwaj today criticised the bureaucrat for making disparging comments against a constitutional authority and said it was for the concerned Ministry to examine whether disciplinary action was called for against him.

On the letter of L.V. Saptarishi, Bhardwaj told reporters “I have no such letter. I cannot tell you if there is any other Minister under whom he is working and he has that letter. He can certainly call for his (the civil servant’s) explanation.” Indicating that the bureaucrat might have breached the discipline by criticising the EC, the Law Minister said “it is not proper for a civil servant to criticise any constitutional authority. They come under certain discipline and they should adhere to that.” Bhardwaj’s comment fly in the face of his Cabinet colleague and Railway Minister Lalu Prasad, who had demanded that the Election Commissioners attacked by Saptarishi should resign.

Saptarishi, nearing his retirement, had claimed to have written a letter to Bhardwaj alleging that the repoll in Chhapra constituency, from where Railway Minister Lalu Prasad has been elected, was ordered last year at the behest of BJP leaders and had launched a broadside at the next Chief Election Commissioner over his alleged casteist remarks.","Chief Election Commissioner T.S. Krishna Murthy and Election Commissioners B.B. Tandon and N. Gopalaswami met President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam to clarify allegations made by IAS officer L.V.

The EC dismissed the claims as baseless, stating that large-scale rigging by both RJD and BJP had necessitated the move. Law Minister H.R. Bhardwaj criticized Saptarishi for violating bureaucratic norms by targeting a constitutional authority. The controversy, politically charged due to RJD leader Lalu Prasad’s involvement, has sparked demands for accountability and disciplinary review.

In a major relief to the Punjab Government, the Supreme Court today stayed the order of the Rajasthan High Court directing it to hand over the maintenance of three head works of the Bhakra and Beas projects to the Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB), an autonomous body under the Union Government.

Admitting the appeal of the Punjab Government against the May 2 order of the high court, directing the state to hand over the management of Ropar, Harike and Ferozepore headworks to the BBMB, a Bench of the Chief Justice, Mr R.C. Lahoti, Mr Justice D.M. Dharmadhikari and Mr Justice G.P. Mahtur said “until further order, the impugned judgement is stayed.”

The court issued notices to the Centre, BBMB, Rajasthan Government and D.M. Singhvi on whose PIL petition the High Court had passed the judgement on May 2.

The stay was granted when senior advocate Harish Salve and Punjab’s Advocate-General Harbhagwan Singh made a special mention of the filing of a special leave petition (SLP) by Punjab and sought immediate stay of the High Court judgement on the ground that it was passed on a petition by an individual without filing of any affidavit by the Centre and the Rajasthan Government.

On specific query by the court as for how many years the headworks in question were being maintained by the Punjab Government, Mr Salve said it was almost 40 years now that the state was managing them.

As Rajasthan Government counsel C.S. Vaidyanathan sought adjournment of the hearing at least by two days to enable him to file a counter-affidavit, the court observed “if nothing has happened all these years there will be no change with the stay.”

Posting further hearing in the matter after the summer vacation starting from next week, the Bench said the parties to the dispute should be aware that a matter relating to the water dispute was already pending before the court.

The Bench was apparently referring to the presidential reference on abrogation of all water accords by Punjab with neighbouring states last year after apex court’s verdict on the construction of the controversial SYL canal.

Seeking to allow its appeal, the Punjab Government warned of irreparable loss and injury if the impugned order was not stayed. “The headworks of Harike, Ferozepore and Ropar…till date have been effectively managed by the state since the very beginning,” the SLP said

Assailing the impugned judgement, the Punjab Government said it was not only against the principle of natural justice for reasons that no opportunity was given to the state to file a counter-affidavit on merits of the case and even without any affidavit being filed by the Union and Rajasthan governments, the SLP said the only question raised by Punjab in its reply before the high court was about the maintainability of the petition on which the order was passed.

The Punjab Government claimed that “Rajasthan has no concern with the Ropar and Ferozepore headworks as the former regulates the supply of water only for distribution within the state and the latter is no longer regulating any canal water supply to Rajasthan after the construction of the Harike headwork.”","The Supreme Court has stayed a Rajasthan High Court order directing the Punjab Government to transfer maintenance of the Ropar, Harike, and Ferozepore headworks to the Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB), an autonomous Union body. Punjab challenged the May 2 order, arguing that it had maintained the headworks for over 40 years and that the High Court passed the ruling without proper input from the Centre or Rajasthan. The court issued notices to the involved parties and deferred further hearing until after the summer recess. Punjab warned of irreparable damage if the stay wasn't granted and questioned Rajasthan’s jurisdiction.

Congress president Sonia Gandhi today came out in stout defence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh even as she lambasted the BJP-led NDA for spreading canards against him in crude and offensive language.

Coming down heavily on the NDA for its self-imposed boycott of the budget session, Mrs Gandhi said they first invented one excuse after another to justify their action and then spread canards against the Prime Minister, who went out of his way to persuade the Opposition leadership to return to the House.

“Not even our most bitter critic can accuse our Prime Minister of being arrogant, subjective and or inconsiderate. Yet, this is what the BJP has done,” she told the Congress Parliamentary Party’s general body meeting today. She exhorted party MPs to explain to their constituents “how parliamentary democracy has been subverted so blatantly by those who often talked of mariada.”

She said BJP’s decision to boycott the session was essentially an attempt to take the focus away from its internal dissensions and its total disarray to issues that have no consistent or substantive content. “Else, why would they have not accepted the offer of the Prime Minister to discuss any of the issues agitating them?” she asked.

The Congress President also went out of her way to congratulate the Prime Minister for his “dignified and effective leadership” of the UPA government which is completing one year in office. She said the government will present a specific progress report about its achievements at its first anniversary on May 22. Expressing satisfaction at the goals achieved across a spectrum of sectors, Mrs. Gandhi said the government was unable to pass the historic Rural Employment Guarantee Act because the standing committee scrutinising it had not returned the Bill because of the BJP boycott.

The Congress president said they too had agitated while in Opposition but their protests related to issues like the tehelka expose, Gujarat riots, CAG indictments on the coffins purchased the Kargil martyrs and sale of PSUs at undervalued prices. In this connection , she referred to the recent CAG reports on the disinvestment of two Mumbai hotels by the NDA government and the improper use of public funds for the “India Shining” campaign, stating that they had only vindicated the Congress stand. “I hope the government will take follow-up action,” she added.

She said fresh revelations had also shown the brazen manner in which the Phukan Commission of inquiry into the tehelka scam was sought to be influenced by those under investigation, clearly referring to former Defence Minister George Fernandes.

The UPA government today displayed its determination to go after former Defence Minister George Fernandes by rejecting the findings of the Phukan Commission report which probed the Tehelka expose into fictitious defence deals.

Terming the report that says no irregularity was committed by Mr Fernandes, as “incomplete,” the government said the findings were “bereft” of reasons and that the panel had not gone into the allegations of corruption. The government said the commission had gone into just two of the four terms and conditions.

The term “B” of the commission specifically included the question of illicit gains by persons in public office, individuals and any other organisation. “However, the part of the report which was submitted to the then Prime Minister on February 4, 2004, did not cover this aspect at all,” the government said in the statement which accompanied the report.

Laying the report in the two Houses of Parliament, the government said it was not bound to table the conclusion as it was “part report” of the commission but it was doing so on the direction of Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee.

However, the Phukan Commission, giving a clean chit to Mr Fernandes, said after examining the records of each of the past transactions and the evidences both oral and documentary, it had found that there was no illegality or irregularity in the 15 defence transactions which had been referred to the commission.

“Therefore, the commission is of the opinion that his (George Fernandes) reputation, as Defence Minister, in respect of the past transactions was not in any way prejudicially affected and hence no recommendation is called for against him in respect of the above transactions,” the commission said in the report.

The commission was constituted after the Tehelka expose and was to investigate 15 major  defence deals, including the acquisition of Russian Sukhoi warplanes, T-90s tanks and the Barak missile system.

Incidentally, Justice Phukan was in the face of a controversy recently for travelling in an IAF VIP plane while probing the defence deals. The permission was alleged to have been given by Mr Fernandes.

The government while pointing out that the report contained the prologue and conclusions arrived at even before the completion of the inquiry, said: “Upon perusing the proceedings before the Justice Phukan Commission, it is clear that Justice Phukan in arriving at his conclusions has not appropriately dealt with the submissions of the commission’s counsel, submitted in writing with reference to almost all 15 transactions, that cases of wrongdoing with reference to most of the transactions were made out without absolving any particular individual”.

The government further said even the conclusions arrived at by Justice Phukan were bereft of reasoning. The government did not consider this a satisfactory way of dealing with such serious issues.

The note said the government had, therefore, decided to entrust the entire inquiry on the 15 transactions to the CBI for a thorough investigation. Action would be taken after the investigations.

“The terms relating to the following of the prescribed procedure in these transactions were inextricably interlinked with other terms, including those relating to corruption charges”, the note said. It said even in the matter of procedure the commission found a number of irregularities and made recommendations for further inquiry in 13 out of 15 transactions which it had examined.

“If the commission has accepted that violation of procedure did take place, it was incumbent upon it to complete the investigation as per the term of reference to establish a nexus,” it said.

“Any finding on other issues without investigation into the main charge will necessarily be an incomplete one and cannot be treated as a final conclusion of the Commission even on such issues,” it said.","The UPA government rejected the findings of the Phukan Commission, which gave a clean chit to former Defence Minister George Fernandes in the Tehelka defence deals case, calling the report incomplete and lacking in reasoning. The government said the commission failed to investigate corruption allegations, a key term of its mandate. It criticized the commission for submitting conclusions before completing the inquiry and has now handed the investigation to the CBI. The Phukan Commission had examined 15 defence transactions and found no illegality, but the government argued that procedural violations and unaddressed corruption charges warranted further investigation.",Politics

The tribune ,2005-05-15 00:00:00,"Opposition is fine, but be responsible: Sonia","Jind, May 14
The UPA Chairman and AICC President, Mrs Sonia Gandhi, today accused the BJP-led NDA of not “behaving like a responsible Opposition” and “not being honest”, as a result of which a number of important pieces of legislation like the Employment Guarantee Scheme Bill had been held up in Parliament.

Addressing a mammoth, but utterly chaotic, “dhanyavad rally” in the Police Lines here, Mrs Gandhi said the NDA’s boycott of Parliament was unjustified.

Lambasting the Opposition, Mrs Gandhi said it had first said the Congress would not be able to form a government at the Centre. “After the UPA government was formed, it said the government would not last. However, the Opposition’s hopes have been dashed. The Dr Manmohan Singh-led government will complete its first year this month. Despite constraints of a coalition, our government has performed very well.”

Mrs Gandhi, who was visibly upbeat over the massive turnout, described the Right to Information Act as a “historic” piece of legislation, which would make the administration “more transparent”.

She said Haryana made progress only under the Congress rule. Whenever other parties came to power, its development was stalled. “Same was the case at the Centre,” she said.

Reminding the people that the Centre had launched the Rajiv Vidyutikaran Yojana (electrification scheme) for villages, Mrs Gandhi said it was true that villages in Haryana had power lines, but the supply was not adequate under the previous government. She directed the Chief Minister, Mr Bhupinder Singh Hooda, to ensure a regular power supply in the state.

Mrs Gandhi said whereas the massive popular mandate was a matter of pride for the Congress, it had also posed a big challenge for the party. Making use of the famous phrase used by a former Prime Minister, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, she reminded Mr Hooda and his colleagues that in a democracy the true “raj dharma” was to live up to the trust of the people in the government. “This is “raj dharma” as well as the dharma of the Congress. Hume sache raj dharam ka palan karna hoga.” She exhorted the Chief Minister not to discriminate against any section of society as well as to ensure that “Hamari kathni aur karni mein koi farak no ho (There should not be any gap between our promises and action).”

She also reminded her party men that for the Congress politics was a means to serve the people and the country.

On her part, Mrs Gandhi assured all help from the Centre for Haryana’s development. “You have suffered a lot under the previous government. Now, there will not be any obstacle to the state’s development.”

She also asked the state government to pay special attention to the welfare of the youth, Dalits, women and to take steps to check the declining sex ratio.

Describing Mrs Gandhi as the “holy stream of the Ganga in the present-day polluted politics, Mr Hooda said she had earlier also visited Jind, which was the place from where farmers started their agitation against the Chautala government and the Congress led a 350-km “padyatra” to express its solidarity with them. “This shook the foundation of the INLD misrule in the state.”

Urging the people to forget the INLD misrule as a “bad dream”, he said the state was now witnessing a new dawn. Highlighting various decisions taken by his government in the past two months for the welfare of various sections like farmers, women, ex-servicemen and traders, Mr Hooda also announced a number of welfare schemes for women “in deference to the wishes of Mrs Gandhi.

To check the declining sex ratio, the government would pay Rs 5,000 per annum for five years on the birth of the second daughter. Under the Indira Gandhi Vivah Shagun scheme, Rs 15,000 would be paid as “kanya daan” at the marriage of girls belonging to weaker sections. Indira Gandhi Government Girls College would be set up in Jind. Women development cooperative societies would be set up, which would be managed by women. The proposed education city would be named after Rajiv Gandhi. A rebate of 2 per cent would be given on the stamp duty if a property was transferred in the name of a woman.

He also promised that the backlog of posts reserved for the Scheduled Castes and the Backward Classes would be cleared on priority.

Giving a clear indication of the government’s plan to waive off power bill arrears of farmers, Mr Hooda said: “Is ka phaya hum hi katenga (only we will solve this problem.” However, he sought an assurance from the audience that in future the power bills would be paid regularly.

Earlier, welcoming Mrs Gandhi, the working president of the Haryana Congress, Mr Randeep Singh Surjewala, thanked her for giving the state a “Chief Minister, who is straightforward, has a clean image and is committed to eradicating corruption and ending the atmosphere of fear in the state.

Mr Surjewala assured Mrs Gandhi that the Congress would again form the government after five years “under the leadership of Mr Hooda”. Before the elections, Mr Surjewala was also considered a contender for the post of Chief Minister.

Among others who spoke were the AICC General Secretary, Mr Janardhan Dwivedi, and the Union Minister, Ms Selja.","Congress President Sonia Gandhi criticized the BJP-led NDA for irresponsibly boycotting Parliament and delaying key legislation like the Employment Guarantee Scheme Bill. At a rally in Jind, Haryana, she praised the UPA government’s performance under Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, calling the Right to Information Act “historic.” She emphasized transparency, inclusiveness, and governance aligned with public trust.

The Union Minister for Civil Aviation, Mr Praful Patel, today brushed aside the resentment over the stalled construction of the terminal of Sri Guru Ramdass International Airport and assured the public that a bigger and modern complex would be built.

Addressing a gathering during the flag-off ceremony of the inaugural Air-India’s Delhi-Amritsar-Birmingham-Toronto flight here today, Mr Patel said top priority was being given to restart the construction of the ultra-modern airport. He, however, said the project could be delayed by another six months as the Ministry of Civil Aviation, in consultation with the Airport Authority of India (AAI), was preparing a blueprint for the its upgradation.

Earlier, the flight was flagged off from New Delhi by Tourism Minister Renuka Chowdhury and Mr Patel.

He said the Air-India was prepared to make this flight operational on a daily basis instead of thrice a week at present in view of its growing demand. A direct international flight of Air-India Express, an economical flight from Amritsar to Dubai, was also on the anvil. He said the Air-India had recently launched a direct flight from Kerala to Dubai and another direct flight from Kolkata to London was likely to commence shortly.

Referring to the setting up of a green field airport at Ladowal between Ludhiana and Jalandhar, Mr Patel said the project had been cleared by the government and was in the advanced stage of implementation. It would come up on the same pattern of green field airports already set up in Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bangalore and Lucknow. He said Chandigarh Airport would also be upgraded to meet the growing need of the people of this area.

Punjab Chief Minister, Amarinder Singh, said the government was set to chalk out a roadmap to boost religious tourism in the state.

He said the government was contemplating to develop religious tourism by connecting Sri Anandpur Sahib, Chamkaur Sahib, Fatehgarh Sahib, Takht Sri Damdama Sahib and Sri Harmandir Sahib. Another circuit of Hindu shrines from Naina Devi, Maisarkhana, Durgiana Temple and Vaishno Devi would also be developed in a big way.

Later Capt Amarinder Singh along with Mr Patel flagged off the flight.

Meanwhile, the General Manager (Architect) of the AAI, Mr Harpal Singh, today made the detail presentation of the new design of the Airport Complex to the Minister of Civil Aviation and visiting dignitaries.

The Director Airport, Mr V.S. Mulekar, said the minister showed keen interest in the development of the airport and said the complex would be ready within a year.

The minister was accompanied by MPs attached to the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Mr Tarlochan Singh, Chairman, National Minorities Commission, among others.","Union Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel, during the launch of Air-India’s Delhi-Amritsar-Birmingham-Toronto flight, assured that construction of the stalled terminal at Sri Guru Ramdass International Airport in Amritsar would resume, with a larger and more modern complex.

The tribune ,2005-05-17 00:00:00,"CWC pats Sonia, Manmohan","The meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) today glossed over all contentious issues and instead concentrated on congratulating itself on the successful completion of the UPA government’s one year in office.

The 25-odd speakers, including Chief Ministers, who participated in the deliberations, competed with each other in heaping praise on Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Mrs Gandhi set the tone when she praised Dr Manmohan Singh’s leadership of the UPA government in her opening remarks. Dr Singh, on his part, lauded Mrs Gandhi for the manner in which she chartered the party through troubled waters with her “maturity, guidance and leadership.”

The two-page resolution adopted by the CWC, showered praise on both Mrs Gandhi and Dr Singh. The resolution appreciated how Mrs Gandhi led the party to victory and then renounced power. It placed on record its acknowledgement of the “quiet dignity and qualities of head and heart” which Dr Singh had brought to bear on his august office.

“Under his leadership, the last 12 months have seen a large number of policies and programmes implemented’, the resolution said and then went on to list the UPA government’s achievements. In fact, the resolution reflected the detailed account of the UPA government’s achievements which the Prime Minister presented at today’s meeting. Stating that a progress report on the UPA government’s performance will be presented to the nation on May 22, Dr Singh then went on to list out its priorities which include agriculture, rural development, infrastructure, health, education, urban renewal and knowledge economy. He also made a special mention of the work being done in rural areas including rural housing, electrification and telecom connectivity, adding that a corpus of Rs.5000 crore had been set up for the development of backward regions.

Although the five-hour marathon session concentrated primarily on the UPA government’s achievements, several speakers, including Satyavrat Chaturvedi, Ram Naresh Yadav, and Ajit Jogi, spoke of maintaining discipline in the party and also how ministers ignored party workers. This, they pointed out, resulted in a communication gap because of which the party was not able to give due publicity to the government’s programmes.

Probably mindful of the party's views on this issue, Mrs Gandhi herself broached the subject in her opening remarks, saying that ministers should keep in mind the sentiments of party workers and interact frequently with them during their tours to the states. This, she felt, will provide an opportunity to the ministers to apprise the workers of the government’s achievements while they could also get their grievances redressed.

Mrs Ambika Soni, chairperson of the Congress media department, told presspersons later that Mrs Gandhi also underlined the importance of implementing the commitments made in the CMP which, according to her, is a document of faith particularly since it also reflects the promises made by the Congress in its election manifesto. This assertion comes in the backdrop of the criticism from the Left parties who maintain the UPA government has not been sincere in the implementation of the CMP.

The CWC acknowledged that it is the first time that the Congress is heading a coalition government with Mrs Gandhi herself observing that running a coalition posed several challenges but was confident of overcoming them. Keeping in mind the sensitivities of its UPA partners, the CWC resolution also went of out its way to congratulate its allies and the Left parties on the UPA government’s first anniversary while appreciating their contribution and cooperation.","At its meeting, the Congress Working Committee (CWC) commended the successful completion of the UPA government’s first year in office, praising both Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress President Sonia Gandhi.

Sonia Gandhi urged ministers to engage more with party workers to bridge communication gaps. Concerns were raised over ministers ignoring grassroots members, affecting publicity of policies.

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) today filed charges against Railways Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav in connection with his alleged role in perpetrating a multi-million rupees fodder scam, along with former Bihar Chief Minister Jagannath Mishra in 1996.

CBI Special Court judge Sanjay Prasad framed the charges against Lalu Prasad in connection with fraudulent withdrawal of Rs 3.13 crore from Dumka treasury between December, 1995 and January, 1996. Yadav was the Chief Minister of Bihar during the period.

The framing of charges against Yadav refers to criminal conspiracy and misuse of official position. Mishra, a former Congress leader, has also been charged by the CBI, along with Yadav in the Rs 960 crore scandal.

Mishra said he was being implicated in the case. “I told the court that there is nothing Lalu Yadav and I did. I am just being implicated in this,” he said.

The RJD leader was also present in the court. The charges were framed under Sections 420 (cheating), 120 b (conspiracy), sections 467 and 477 of the Indian Penal code (467, 477) and Sections 13(1) and 13(1) (d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

If he had failed to turn up before the court retired for the day, the court would have split the case while cancelling his arrest warrant, CBI court sources said.

With this, the way has been cleared for the trial beginning on June 20 in the case of alleged fraudulent withdrawals in 1995-96 by the Animal Husbandry Department of over Rs.37 million from the Dumka treasury - money that was earmarked for buying animal fodder for poor farmers.

During the course of the trial, 345 witnesses would be examined.

There were a total of 49 accused in the case relating to fraudulent withdrawal from the Dumka treasury. While six of the accused died, three of them turned approvals.

On April 25, another special CBI court of Umashankar Prasad had framed charges against Yadav, Mishra and 68 others in a case relating to fraudulent withdrawal of Rs 37 crore from Chaibasa treasury, now in Jharkhand, in 1996.

The CBI has filed chargesheets in 60 cases, of which 53 are being tried in the courts at Ranchi and seven in Patna. The Rs 950 crore fodder scam was unearthed in Bihar in 1996.

The fodder scam has become a bone of contention between the ruling Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA), of which Yadav is an important ally, and the BJP-led opposition National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which has demanded Lalu’s resignation.

The standoff led the Opposition to boycott the recent Budget Session of Parliament, lashing out at Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for being soft on a charged minister. ","The CBI Special Court in Ranchi has framed charges against Railways Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav and former Bihar Chief Minister Jagannath Mishra in connection with the 1996 fodder scam involving fraudulent withdrawals from the Dumka treasury.

The case pertains to Rs 3.13 crore withdrawn by the Animal Husbandry Department. A total of 345 witnesses will be examined.

The seven-hour-long UPA-Left Coordination Committee meeting today ended on a discord note with the Communists disassociating with the Congress-led coalition’s assessment of the performance of Manmohan Singh government during the past one year.

UPA, in a statement, claimed, “Those present at the meeting expressed overall satisfaction and resolved to move forward even more purposefully to implement their collective political, social and economic agenda as embodied in the National Common Minimum Programme.”

While the AICC General Secretary Ambika Soni, briefing reporters on the Coordination Committee meeting, claimed that it was a joint statement of all those present at the meeting, CPM General Secretary Prakash Karat, striking a dissent note, said “This is an assessment of the UPA and not that of the Left parties.”

In a dissenting statement, CPM said, “As far as the assessment of the one year of the UPA government is concerned, the Politburo of the CPM has already made an assessment in its meeting held on May 14 and 15.”

The Politburo criticised that “Hardly any legislation which addresses the needs of the vast masses of the poorer section in our country has been moved in Parliament in this one year by the UPA government.”

“The UPA government is not sufficiently concerned about the need to distance itself from the discredited policies of the past. There is an entrenched system of thought and personnel that believe neo-liberal reforms are the way to take the country forward.”

The only point with which Karat agreed with the UPA statement was, “The UPA partners and the Left parties reaffirmed their resolve to confront and combat communal forces and strengthen the secular pillars of the Indian state.”

Karat said the Coordination Committee meeting was useful, as it gave an “overall view of the performance of the UPA government in the past one year. Certain concerns of the Left parties were also raised in the course of the meeting.”

Ambika Soni claimed that the meeting was held in a “very cordial and friendly atmosphere with no discordant note at the meeting.” She said Congress President Sonia Gandhi was optimistic that the Left parties would come around and agree to participate in the UPA’s anniversary party on May 22.

The Left parties have distanced themselves from the anniversary bash claiming it to be the celebration of the UPA government and “we are not part of this government....we are only supporting from outside.”

The UPA statement said the committee underscored the criticality of the recently announced Bharat Nirman programme in bringing prosperity to our country’s villages. It also appreciated the launch of the rural health mission, the national horticulture mission, and the national urban renewal mission.

It emphasised the need to fully empower panchayats as the key to Bharat Nirman, ensure gender equality and extend social security to workers in the unorganised sector. It rededicated itself to pursue transparency, accountability, and probity in administration.

Ambica Soni said the meeting was convened to prepare the progress report of the UPA government to be released on May 22 on the completion of one year of the Congress-led coalition government in office.

She said there were several demands for ordering the CBI probe into six major Gujarat riot cases, in which even the Supreme Court had also asked for trial outside the state.

Earlier, during the presentation of achievements of respective ministries, Home Minister Shivraj Patil, too, had faced insistent Left leaders, who kept demanding CBI inquiry into six cases related to the post-Godhra Gujarat violence, the sources said.

Trying to placate them, the Home Minister explained that it was not wise to order all cases to be investigated by the Central agency. He pointed out that the government had already ordered CBI inquiry into the Centaur sale deal, which the Left had been demanding.

But unrelenting in their demand, the Left leaders pointed to the recent statement made by former Gujarat Governor Sunder Singh Bhandari and the Supreme Court strictures against the Narendra Modi government as the reasons for the CBI probe.

Ambica Soni also said some of the Left members expressed their views on the resumption of arms supply to Nepal.

The CPM Politburo had criticised the UPA government for reversing its decision to suspend the military supplies to the Nepalese armed forces. “The UPA government should not be seen to be siding with the King against the democratic and popular forces,” it said.

The Congress leader said the DMK leader M Karunanadhi demanded early settlement of water dispute between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, amendment to the Constitution to enable the states to determine the quantum of reservation to be given in a particular state and also amendment to the Hindu Marriage Act.

The Politburo had stated that no legislation had been proposed for unorganised workers, adding that in this way the needs of the poor of the country had not been met. Other areas that came under criticism were the financial policies of the UPA government. It said privatisation of pension funds is not acceptable.

The Left had also rejected the increase in FDIs or foreign direct investments and they said that successive hikes in the prices of petroleum products in the last one-year had adversely affected the common people.

The day-long discussion, she said was held on a six structured themes: agriculture, rural development and panchayati raj; education, health and nutrition; empowerment of weaker sections; internal security; infrastructure and economic growth and defence and foreign policy.

When asked whether there was any demand of resignation of Railway Minister and RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav, following the framing of charges against in a fodder scam case, she said, “the issue never came up.”

All UPA members and the four Left parties attended today’s meeting. Besides Dr Singh and UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi, Defence Minister Pranab Mukherjee, Home Minister Shivraj Patil, External Affairs Minister Natwar Singh, Finance Minister P Chidambaram, Oil Minister Mani Shankar Iyer, Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar, Railway Minister Lalu Prasad, Human Resource Development Minister Arjun Singh, Steel Minister Ram Vilas Paswan, Rural Development Minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh and DMK chief Karunanidhi were among others who were present.

The Left parties were represented by CPM general secretary Prakash Karat and his CPI counterpart A B Bardhan, CPM Polit Bureau member Sitaram Yechuri, CPI secretary D Raja, Forward Bloc general secretary Debabrata Biswas and RSP Rajya Sabha member Abani Roy.","The UPA-Left Coordination Committee meeting ended with discord as the Left parties distanced themselves from the UPA’s positive assessment of its one-year performance.

The Union Cabinet today approved the mid-term appraisal (MTA) of the 10th Five Year Plan (2002-07). The MTA, which would now be discussed at the next meeting of the National Development Council (NDC), has listed 58 policy imperatives to pitchfork the economy into a high growth trajectory.

The MTA, which would be made public after its adoption by the NDC, was also expected to scale down the GDP growth target from 8.1 per cent as originally projected in 2002.

“The actual growth in the first three years has been less than what it was approved in the 10th plan. In the first year itself (2002-03), growth was 4 per cent”, Finance Minister P. Chidambaram told newspersons after the Cabinet meeting.

Mr Chidambaram said that “Like any other appraisal, the MTA will contain successes and slippages”.

Sources said that in the backdrop of continuous poor performance in the agriculture sector, the growth targets could be scaled down. It would be hard to push agriculture growth from the present 2 per cent to 4 per cent.

The MTA had gone into the details of whether the original 10th Plan growth target was still feasible. The current year’s GDP growth was likely to range between 6 and 7 per cent of GDP so that achievement of the Plan target was only possible if GDP growth in the last two years averaged 11 per year, which was clearly infeasible.

The MTA was also learnt to have advocated the case of offloading government stake in sick public sector undertakings.

The Tenth Plan was built around a specific set of assumptions that affected the investment strategy of the Plan. In the base year of the Tenth Plan (2001-02), the economy was in the middle of a cyclical slow-down, with the investment rate at 23.2 per cent of GDP as against the peak of 26.2 per cent achieved in 1995-96. Capacity utilisation was low in a number of sectors, especially in manufacturing. Agricultural output, and thereby rural incomes, had shown relatively low growth and high volatility through the Ninth Plan period (1997-98 - 2001-02).

It was felt that private investment demand was unlikely to revive until the capacity utilisation in industry increased to significantly higher levels. Revival of rural consumption demand was expected to contribute to investment expansion, but this would only happen over time if agricultural growth targets were met and the MTA had made recommendations in this aspect, sources said.

Infrastructure had been recognised to be a critical constraint needing large investments and it was expected that policies would be evolved which would allow a large contribution of private investment to support expanded public investment in their area. Investment in irrigation and watershed management was recognised to be critical for agriculture.

The MTA would take stock of the progress made in utilising productive capacities and the success achieved on the investment front.
","The Union Cabinet approved the Mid-Term Appraisal (MTA) of the 10th Five Year Plan (2002–07), which will now be presented at the upcoming National Development Council (NDC) meeting. Finance Minister P. Chidambaram noted that actual GDP growth in the first three years had fallen short of the original 8.1% target, necessitating a likely downward revision. The MTA outlines 58 policy imperatives, addressing poor agricultural performance, slow investment revival, and infrastructure constraints. It suggests increasing private investment and considers disinvestment in sick PSUs. The appraisal emphasizes the need for reforms to drive long-term, sustainable economic growth and productivity.",Business and Finance

The Indian Express,2012-04-18 00:00:00,"Ministries told to frame,reveal discretionary power norms","In an attempt to stamp out irregularities,all central government ministries have been asked to frame guidelines on the disbursal of favours through their ministers discretionary powers,and to put these rules in the public domain in order to ensure transparency.All ministries are advised to put in place regulating parameters for exercise of discretionary powers,wherever such guidelines do not exist,and place them in the public domain, says a circular issued by the Department of Personnel & Training on April 16 . Published norms for doling out discretionary favours would minimise any arbitrariness in exercise of such powers,says the circular.The circular,the culmination of a demand made by Congress chairperson Sonia Gandhi in 2010,was endorsed by the nine-member Group of Ministers on Corruption in its second report submitted to the prime minister early March. The GoM,which had earlier batted for scrapping these powers,amended its stance following feedback from 84 central ministries/departments that while 37 of them had no discretionary powers,the rest had only limited discretion,most of which was non-financial.The most criticised discretionary powers,dealing with allotment of petrol pumps,gas connections and admission in Kendriya Vidyalayas,have already been abolished. And there are no takers anymore for out-of-turn telephone connections.The non-economic powers that ministries have include giving diplomatic passports and allocating Haj seats. In a majority of the cases,the discretionary powers are in fact powers exercised by the ministers in performance of their bona fide duties, the GoM report said. These include appointments to boards and corporations.The GoM was set up in January 2011 to suggest measures to tackle corruption,and asked to advise whether discretionary powers enjoyed by central ministers could be relinquished.Shubhanshu Shukla, the first Indian astronaut to reach the ISS, spoke with Indian students during his ham radio interaction from space.

It urges the apex court to restrain the Orissa government from agreeing to the conditions imposed by means of blackmail by the CPI (Maoist).A bench of Justices T S Thakur and Gyan Sudha Misra will hear the petition tomorrow. It has expressly sought the presence of a senior law officer for the hearing.Bakshi has made the Ministry of Home Affairs a party to the litigation,seeking a direction to frame proper law and guidelines to tackle the problem of Maoist insurgency.The PIL is also on a larger question of framing a policy to deal with Maoist insurgency. Whenever there is a hostage crisis,we have seen craven surrender from the governments side. There should be a standard operating procedure to deal with this crisis. Negotiations are the starting point,and generally used to buy time to trace the hostage and plan a rescue operation, the retired officer explained when contacted.Hikakas abduction had followed that of two Italians. The maoists had demanded the release of their cadre for freeing all three.In the present instance,the CPI (Maoist) have targeted civilian non-combatants to fulfill their rapacious demands. If their jailed comrades are released from jails on the basis of blackmail by these disruptive anti-social elements of society,this act of the state government will create insecurity in the minds of the people as well as scores of officers of the law enforcement agencies, the petition said.Though the Orissa CM agreed to release some Maoist cadres and their supporters,including 15 members of the pro-Maoist group Chasi Mulia Adivasi Sangh,the rebels had disagreed,instead demanding the release of others,including hardcore commander Chenda Bhushanam alias Ghasi.Bakshi accuses Orissa of having evolved a noble method of releasing Maoists by granting them bail to avoid confrontation with the rebels.The bail application filed on behalf of the Maoists is not opposed by the public prosecutor. This is how the diktat of Maoists is being carried out by the state government,forgetting the law and rule of law, the petition says.Bakshi says such methods are bound to backfire. The CPI (Maoist) has a professed policy of indulging in a so-called Protracted Peoples War against the Indian government.Giving figures from the govenrments own records,the petition says: The Ministry of Home Affairs,on its website,reports that the Communist Party of India (Maoist) is the biggest Left Wing Extremist outfit in India. The statistics reveal that the Maoists have killed as many as 5,467 civilians during 2001 to 2011.Shubhanshu Shukla, the first Indian astronaut to reach the ISS, spoke with Indian students during his ham radio interaction from space.

For 51 hours beginning Sunday night,it was also the only thing that kept the 17-year-old from death.Sanjeev was the only person to be dug out of the rubble of the Shital Fibres blanket-making unit alive today. One more body was recovered,taking the death toll in the factory collapse to 10. While 73 were injured,many continue to be missing.Sanjeev,a migrant labourer from Gopalganj in Bihar,said he was saved because the thread-weaving machine at which he had been working as a cloth cutter tilted on its side as the factory came down. Sanjeev slipped under the machine,which took the load of the debris that rained down.While rescue teams reached Sanjeev on Tuesday evening,they could bring him out only after midnight  close to three hours later. He survived with only a few injuries on his left thigh.From his hospital bed,Sanjeev said he was working on the ground floor of the four-storey building at the time of the disaster. I tried to call friends on the phone,but there was no signal. It was very dark,and I was not able to see anything. I tried to stay calm and leave everything to my destiny. Then,after a long time,I heard someone call out Koi hai (Anybody there)?. I started shouting,Please help me,give me some water, said Sanjeev. Then somebody sent me water and biscuits with the help of a rod. I drank the water; it was like life flowing through me.Two others,Vinod and Bhagoo Dass,were working with him on the same machine and Sanjeev doesnt know what happened to them. His cousin Nitesh died in the collapse.Commandant R K Verma,in-charge of the National Disaster Response Force whose men brought out Sanjeev,says they heard some sound at the rear end of the factory. We began digging but could not find anyone. After cutting out the debris,we made a small hole. A volunteer of the Dera Sacha Sauda was sent in. He had a torch and kept shouting Koi hai?.Verma adds that when the torch light first fell on Sanjeev,he mistook it for sunlight,given how long he had been in the dark,and thought the debris above him had been removed. He screamed to be rescued,but the place was too small to bring him out,says Verma. So we told him we would be back soon. We then tied a water bottle and a pack of biscuits at the end of a 10-feet-long rod and passed it to Sanjeev. Meanwhile we put a fan at the hole of the debris so he could breathe. After three hours,he was brought out.Sanjeev is worried about what happens now. The sole earning member of his family,with parents and an eight-year-old brother to support,he used to earn Rs 7,000 a month at the factory after a daily 12-hour shift. He sent Rs 4,000 of that back home. His phone and Rs 9,000 that he had managed to save got lost in the collapse.It was the hope of a decent livelihood that brought him and cousin Nitesh to Punjab,Sanjeev says. While inside the collapsed building,I asked myself several times why I was here,that Id have been safe back home. However,then I would remember that my family was surviving because I was employed here.Now that he is out though,even as he cant help talking about the machine that saved him,Sanjeev is clear that he does not want to work in Punjab anymore. I do not want to die here, he says.You May LikeShubhanshu Shukla, the first Indian astronaut to reach the ISS, spoke with Indian students during his ham radio interaction from space.

There is no doubt about that”.Speaking to reporters in the northern town of Skardu after reviewing the search for 138 people who were buried by an avalanche that hit a high-altitude army camp,Kayani said Pakistan hoped that the Siachen issue is “resolved so that both the countries don’t have to pay the cost”.“There will be a resolution and we want that there should be a resolution (of the Siachen issue). There should be a resolution of Siachen and other issues,” Kayani said in response to questions during a rare media interaction.Peaceful co-existence between the two countries “is very important” as it will enable everybody to “concentrate on the well-being of the people”,he said.“We in the army understand very well that there should be a very good balance between defence and development,” he said.The two countries cannot “keep spending on defence alone and forget about development” because the security of a country depends not only on securing the borders but on ensuring that the people “are happy and their needs are being met”,Kayani said.Responding to public concerns about the deployment of troops on Siachen in the wake of the avalanche,the Army chief said,”Everyone knows why the army is here — because in 1984,the Indian Army occupied the area and in response to that,the Pakistan Army was sent in”.He contended it was the army’s duty to defend the country “whatever the cost”.Shubhanshu Shukla, the first Indian astronaut to reach the ISS, spoke with Indian students during his ham radio interaction from space.

The Indian Express,2012-04-18 00:00:00,Women ‘3 times likelier to suffer migraine than men’,"As compared to every man with a migraine,three women are struck down by the severe headache that often comes with nausea and a sensitivity to light and sound,experts say.An astonishing 25 per cent of women have suffered a migraine,making it one of the most common disabling conditions around the globe.Studies using various neuroimaging techniques have shown that migraines are not caused by the constriction and dilation of blood vessels,but rather they begin as a problem of brain excitability.And the female brain has an intrinsic excitability that predisposes them to migraines, according to researchers.Dr Andrew Charles,director of the Headache Research and Treatment Programme at the University of California,believes women have a faster trigger than men for activating the waves of brain activity thought to underlie migraines,the Daily Mail reported.Dr Charles said that migraines show cortical spreading depression (CSD),when dramatic waves of activity spread across the surface of the brain.This triggers not only the pain of a migraine but the visual symptoms,nausea,dizziness and difficulty concentrating so common in sufferers.Dr Charles and fellow researcher Dr Kevin Brennan used imaging techniques to visualise the initiation and spread of CSD in mice.Female mice showed a significantly lower threshold for CSD when compared with males. In other words,it was much easier to evoke the waves of brain activity believed to underlie migraine in females than it was in males.The results were very clear. The strength of the stimulus required to trigger CSD in males was up to two or three times higher than that required to trigger the response in females, said Dr Charles.A variety of factors may reduce the CSD threshold in both sexes,making them more susceptible to migraines. These include genes,hormones and environmental triggers such as stress,diet,changes in sleep patterns and a host of others.While it is known that migraines in females fluctuate with the menstrual cycle and are more frequent during the menstrual period,Dr Charles said his results appear to be independent of a specific phase of the cycle.We didnt monitor the estrous cycle in the female mice,so its likely we sampled from different estrous phases in different animal, he said.Yet we still found a consistent difference in the CSD threshold between males and females.Our results suggest that the female brain has an intrinsic excitability that predisposes them to migraine that may not be simply linked to a specific phase of the menstrual cycle, he added.But some researchers believe migraines are enflamed by the hormonal fluctuation of a womans menstrual cycle.Boys are slightly more likely to experience a migraine than girls,but once a girl begins menstruating,the likelihood of her suffering a migraine rockets.This is blamed on estrogen,although other hormones are also thought to be a trigger.

Studies on mice revealed that female mice required significantly less stimulus to trigger CSD compared to males.

The Indian Express,2012-04-18 00:00:00,Gopinath to launch carrier,"G R Gopinath,who introduced the no-frill airline concept in India by starting Air Deccan and sold it off later to Kingfisher promoter Vijay Mallya,now plans to launch another scheduled carrier.“I have got the clearance,” Gopinath said but refused to elaborate saying he would speak at the right time.Gopinath,who now runs Deccan Charters started in 1997,received a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Civil Aviation Ministry almost two months ago to launch a new carrier.Getting the NOC is only the first step to get a license to fly. An applicant has to submit several documents relating to project feasibility report,business plan,company details,its ownership and types of planes to be flown. An operator can start a passenger airline with one plane,but has to induct five planes within a year of securing the flying permit.Gopinath founded the first no-frill carrier Air Deccan in 2003,which became became the number two airline in terms of the number of passengers flown within two years.In 2007,Vijay Mallya’s UB Group bought a 26 per cent stake in it and eventually completed a takeover after buying shares through an open offer.This deal had a five-year non-compete clause,the term of which would end in the next few months,industry sources said.A non-compete clause is a covenant not to compete. It is used in the contract law under which one party agrees not to pursue a similar profession or trade in competition against another party (in this case launching a competing airline).After Air Deccan sale,Gopinath launched a cargo service,Deccan 360,which did not do well. A plan to start a regional air transport service in Gujarat also did not take off.The Deccan Charters,which is operating now,has a fleet of 12 choppers and three turboprop planes,besides five private jets. It has a non-scheduled operator permit.Shubhanshu Shukla, the first Indian astronaut to reach the ISS, spoke with Indian students during his ham radio interaction from space.

While he has confirmed the clearance, Gopinath has not provided further details, stating he will share more information at an appropriate time. The NOC is the initial step in obtaining a flying license, which requires a comprehensive submission of documents, including a business plan and aircraft details. Gopinath's previous ventures included Air Deccan, which became the second-largest airline in India shortly after its launch in 2003, and Deccan 360, a cargo service that struggled to succeed. Currently, he operates Deccan Charters, which has a fleet of helicopters and private jets. A non-compete clause from the sale of Air Deccan to Vijay Mallya's UB Group is expected to expire soon.",Business and Finance
The Indian Express,2012-04-18 00:00:00,No need for a separate exit policy for telcos: Trai,"In what may come as a shock to operators looking to exit the telecom business in India,sectoral regulator Trai today said there is no need for a separate exit policy and licence fee would will continue to be non-refundable.The Department of Telecommunications had asked Telecom Regulatory Authority of India in October last year to recommend an exit policy for licencees who wish to exit telecom services under a licence.“Presently,there is no need for a separate exit policy for all types of licences and the entry fee paid by the licencees will continue to be non-refundable as per their licence terms and conditions,” Trai said in its recommendations on Exit Policy for various telecom licences.Trai had asked for stakeholders’ views on the proposed policy on surrender of spectrum by telecom operators and if any refund should be made,along with other provisions for the exit policy.In its draft response in March this year,Trai had categorised licences as: 122 UAS licences given on/after January 10,2008; basic/CMTS/UASL given prior to January  10,2008; all other licences like NLD,ILD,ISP etc; and future licences.Trai is of the view currently,there is no need for an exit policy for those operators whose licences were cancelled by the Supreme Court on February 2.The apex court had quashed 122 licences given in 2008 under the then telecom minister A Raja terming them illegal. As per the judgement,the licences stand cancelled from June 2.“The Authority does not agree with the argument of one of the stakeholders that the licencees have the option of filing a curative petition…The Authority cannot formulate a policy based on the likely outcome of a futuristic event,” it said.Licences like National Long Distance,Internet service provider etc carry low entry fee and have option to surrender their licence after giving notice.“Present conditions in various licences with regard to surrender of licences,whereby licencee can surrender its licence by giving a notice of atleast 60 calender days (30 calender days in case of ISP licences) in advance shall continue to be applicable,” Trai said.For future licences,Trai has already recommended that all new licences issued would be Unified Licences and entry fee for pan-India licence has been kept low and will be non-refundable.Shubhanshu Shukla, the first Indian astronaut to reach the ISS, spoke with Indian students during his ham radio interaction from space.

The Indian Express,2012-04-18 00:00:00,Contempt order against IFCI CEO quashed,"In a major relief to Industrial Finance Corporation of India Ltd (IFCI) and its top officials,the Delhi High Court has quashed its earlier order awarding one-month jail term,besides a fine of Rs five lakh,to the CEO of the PSU and two other officials for contempt of court.A bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Rajiv Shakdher quashed the March 19 order of the single-judge bench saying once an unqualified apology was tendered by contemnors,there was no need “for the court to either proceed with the conviction or impose sentence and that too such a harsh one”.“We are of the unequivocal view that all the three appeals are liable to be allowed. Orders of conviction of February 6,2012,and order on sentence of March 19,2012,are liable to be set aside with the acceptance of apology on the part of Assistant General Manager (Law) Shalini Soni and Recovery Officer of Debt Recovery Tribunal R K Bansal while CEO-cum-MD Atul Kumar Rai is held not to have any role in the matter in issue.“We may also notice another aspect of the matter arising from the quantum of fine imposed on the contemnors. The Contempt of Courts Act provides for a fine which may extend to Rs 2,000 but the fine imposed in the present case is running into lakhs. This is contrary to the statutory provisions,” the bench said.The single judge bench had on March 19 imposed a fine of Rs five lakh on IFCI,while sentencing its Atul Kumar Rai and Shalini Soni and R K Bansal to a month in jail each after holding them guilty of having committed contempt of court.The bench,however,had kept its order “in abeyance” for four weeks,giving time to the contemnors to go in an appeal against its order.The single-judge bench of Justice P K Bhasin had said the impression needed to be “washed away” from the public mind that court would melt down with an apology and one could get away easily even after not complying with the court’s orders.Disagreeing with the order,the larger bench referred to the provisions of the Contempt of Courts Act and held that “merely because a corporate entity is alleged to have committed contempt would not be a ground to make the CEO/ Managing Director or head of the organization liable for contempt if he had no knowledge of the same.”“We find that there is no case whatsoever of contempt made out against Atul Kumar Rai while Shalini Soni ought to have been more careful in first assailing the order of October 8,2009,in appeal before filing an application before the Recovery Officer on which orders were passed on February 22,2010,” the bench added.The HC’s larger bench also took a similar view in the case of the Recovery Officer,who was also held in contempt of court,saying the unqualified apology tendered more than met the requirement as it was not a case of willful disobedience.The single-judge had passed the order after it came to know that IFCI and its two senior officials had violated its directions to remit the sale proceeds of Koshika Telecom Ltd to the telecom firm’s official liquidator.The single judge had also taken strong exception to the DRT recovery officer’s act of going against the court’s orders and had said if no steps are taken,”subordinate authorities shall get emboldened and start obliging the litigants with impunity by giving them reliefs even though the high court had rejected the same.”The IFCI had moved the DRT against Koshika Telecom Ltd for recovery of its loan of over Rs 200 crore and at the instance of the public sector organisation some of the assets of the telecom company was auctioned off by DRT.The IFCI had gone to the DRT amid the winding up proceeding of Koshika Telecom Ltd,going on under the supervision of an official liquidator,appointed by the Delhi High Court to oversee the sale of all the assets of the telecom firm.As the firm’s official liquidator came to know of the debt recovery proceeding before the DRT,it brought it to the notice of the High Court which asked the IFCI to remit the firm’s sale proceeds to the liquidator.But the IFCI and its two officials moved the DRT recovery officer,who in “utter defiance of the order of the (high) court obliged the IFCI by accepting its application and granting it permission to utilise the sale proceeds,” said the court.Shubhanshu Shukla, the first Indian astronaut to reach the ISS, spoke with Indian students during his ham radio interaction from space.

A larger bench found that the imposition of such a severe penalty was unwarranted after the officials tendered an unqualified apology. The court noted that the fine exceeded the statutory limit of Rs 2,000 under the Contempt of Courts Act. The original contempt ruling stemmed from IFCI's failure to comply with a court order to remit sale proceeds from Koshika Telecom Ltd to its official liquidator.

The duo stitched unconquered 53 runs for the third-wicket as KKR scored 127 for two in 16.3 overs.Earlier,Kings XI batsmen lost wickets at regular intervals to be restricted to the modest total after opting to bat at the PCA stadium.Captain Adam Gilchrist,who retired hurt in the sixth over with a right hamstring problem only to return later to drag his side out of trouble,top-scored with an unbeaten 40,while Shaun Marsh made a 30-ball 33 with the help of four boundaries.Kings XI batsmen struggled from the onset against a determined KKR bowling line up and it could be gauged from the fact that only three of their batters could manage double figures.Wily West Indian off-spinner Sunil Narine (2/24) and Brett Lee (2/26) starred with the ball for KKR,sharing four wickets between them. Laxmipathy Balaji (1/20) and RajatBhatia (1/23) also picked up a wicket each for the visitors. KKR’s started their run chase on a blistering pace,racing on to their fifty inside the sixth over.Brendon McCullum (15) was the initial aggressor as he clobbered Praveen Kumar for two boundaries in the first over.KKR skipper Gautam Gambhir matched his partner stroke by stroke and welcomed Harmeet Singh with a huge six over mid-wicket and a four in the bowler’s opening over.After the initial burst,McCullum found boundaries hard to come by,which finally led to his dismissal. Struggling to score freely,the Kiwi hit a Piysuh Chawla’s (2/19) short,way down the leg side delivery straight to Dimitri Mascarenhas at short fine-leg,but not before stitching a 53-run opening stand with Gambhir. Chawla picked up his second wicket four overs later when Manvinder Bisla (11) dragged a delivery on to his stumps.Gambhir,on the other hand,played a calm and composed innings and notched up his half century in just 36 balls.In Kallis,Gambhir found a perfect partner as they duo went about their business in style.Kallis struck little-kwown Bhargav Bhatt for back-to-back four and a six to finish off the run chase in emphatic fashion.Earlier,Kings XI’s last year’s hero,Paul Valthaty once again disappointed as he fell early,outside edging a Lee delivery to Bisla behind the stumps in the third over.To make matters worse for Kings XI,Gilchrist had to retired hurt in the sixth over.Kings XI failed to get a substantial partnership as Mandeep Singh (6),Marsh,David Hussey (10),Paras Dogra (6) and Mascarenhas (9) all departed in quick intervals.Marsh’s dismissal in the 14th over,however,turned out to be a little controversial.The left-hander underedged an attempted cut off a Lee delivery which just seemed to have carried to Bisla behind the wicket. But the batsmen was not satisfied and walked away only after checking with the keeper.The dismissal also brought Kings XI owner Preity Zinta on to the ground as she was not satisfied with the decision. She,however,left the field only after Gilchrist intevened.Towards the end,Gilchrist and Chawla (9) tried their level best to shoot up the run rate but failed.Shubhanshu Shukla, the first Indian astronaut to reach the ISS, spoke with Indian students during his ham radio interaction from space.

Despite scoring 87 off 56 balls which handed Kings XI Punjab a five-wicket defeat,it took Gayle a while to come anywhere close to obliging the fan.After the innings break Punjab were quick off the blocks with Parvinder Awana,playing just his second IPL match,sending back Mayank Agarwal and Virat Kohli in his first over,the second of the innings. When the Delhi Ranji player then dismissed Saurabh Tiwary in the first ball of his third over,his spell read 2.1-0-6-3 and Bangalore was reeling at 25/3.Joined by AB de Villiers,Gayle shelved the big shots and instead the pair accumulated in the early part of their 131-run stand. By then,Awana had already sent down three overs and was taken off the attack and while Piyush Chawla was played out,the other bowlers were slowly taken to task. Harmeet Singh and Azhar Mahmood were hit for at least a boundary an over and the rest came in singles as Bangalore kept pace without having to go big.When Gayle moved from 49 to 51 with a double in the 13th over,he had scored five boundaries and a six off the 41 balls he had faced at that stage. The required run rate had crept upto ten. Gayle then went for it,and the next 36 runs would come of just 16 balls. He started off by hitting Harmeet for a six back over his head,and a couple of overs later sent Praveen Kumar crashing for another six and a four. Awanas final over saw Gayle crack two hits to the boundary and one over it before David Hussey pulled off a sharp catch inside the circle. Just six of the 36 runs Gayle scored after his half century had come of singles.With the pitch offering some bounce,the South African too played at ease without having to employ his famous reverse sweep or switch hit during a well made 52. Though the pair could not finish off the job,Bangalore won without ever looking in trouble during the later stages.Earlier,Azhar Mahmoods quickfire 33 in his first IPL game boosted Punjab to a par score. David Hussey and fellow Australian Shaun Marsh steadied Punjabs innings after Paul Valthaty continued his bad form with the bat,departing for six,caught behind off Zaheer Khan. Khan had also removed new comer Nitin Saini in his second over but Marsh and Hussey,and later Hussey and Mandeep Singh dragged Punjab out of trouble with usefull parnerships.Mahmoods impactDespite the associations,the home side was never able to get on top  of the bowling,and when Hussey was cleaned up for 41 at the end of the 15th over Punjab were tottering at 105/5. At that time,it looked like even a par score was beyond the side as most of the recognised batsmen were already back in the hut. Mahmood,who missed a few of Punjabs earlier games due to visa issues,then slammed a 14-ball 33 that included three fours and two sixes.Mandeep ran hard and turned the strike over effectively,making 20 off 15 balls without hitting a single boundary. The partnership,worth 44 runs and coming in 19 balls along with Mahmoods late onslaught yielded the side 51 of the last four overs. The side eventually ended with 163,but with Gayle deciding to buckle down,the score did not,however,prove to be very defensible.Gopal Khemka, a prominent businessman and owner of Magadh Hospital, was fatally shot near his residence in Patna. This comes six years after his son's murder in a similar manner. Khemka is reportedly associated with the BJP and was shot at close range by unidentified assailants.

Parvinder Awana of Punjab made an impressive debut, taking three wickets early on, but the team struggled to maintain control. Although Punjab set a target of 167 runs, their score of 163 was insufficient against Gayle's explosive performance in the latter part of the innings.

Daredevils paid $700,000 for Y Venugopala Rao,the former India batsman,who has played just three games While Nagar has featured in all five of Delhis games this season.Nagars statistics in the IPL are nothing remarkable,but his value can not always be determined in terms of numbers. In 17 IPL games,he has made just 148 runs at an average of 14.8 and a highest score of 23 off 15 achieved on Thursday against Deccan Chargers. But Nagar knows that he will be judged by the value of his cameos,like the 48-run partnership along with centurion Kevin Pietersen,rather than the sum total of his numbers.I am slotted at No.6 in the line-up,and sometimes even below,so whenever my turn comes,its 30 required off 10 balls or so.

Viru bhai (Virender Sehwag) knows that and has allowed me to enjoy my game, Nagar told The Indian Express on the eve of the game against Pune Warriors India.Before the start of the season,Nagar wondered if he would make the cut in a star-studded team,including Kevin Pietersen,Ross Taylor and Mahela Jayawardene.Fielding prowessBut Sehwag reposed faith in the youngster. I know that with such a strong line-up,I may not even get to bat in most matches. But I want to make my chances count just like I did during the game against Deccan Chargers, Nagar said. The all-rounders strongest suit,however,could well be his fielding within the circle. Nagar has a copy of the photograph of him diving in from mid-off to pull off a brilliant catch to dismiss Sanath Jayasuriya. It is one of his proudest moments on the field,one which highlights why this local player is highly rated in the Daredevils camp.If I dont get my name on the score sheet because of my batting or bowling,I can also do so with my fielding (run outs) and catches, Nagar added.Gopal Khemka, a prominent businessman and owner of Magadh Hospital, was fatally shot near his residence in Patna. This comes six years after his son's murder in a similar manner. Khemka is reportedly associated with the BJP and was shot at close range by unidentified assailants. Police are investigating the incident and examining CCTV footage to determine the motive.","All-rounder Yogesh Nagar is notable for being the only cricketer to play for the Delhi Daredevils in all five seasons of the Indian Premier League (IPL) without having represented India at any level. Despite his modest statistics—148 runs in 17 matches with a highest score of 23—Nagar's contributions, particularly in crucial moments, have earned him a place in the team over more prominent players. He emphasizes his role as a finisher and his fielding skills, which he considers vital to his value in the squad. Nagar's confidence has been bolstered by the support of captain Virender Sehwag, who recognizes his potential despite the star-studded lineup. In addition to his cricketing abilities, Nagar takes pride in his fielding, aiming to make an impact through catches and run-outs.",Sports

Any hopes of a decisive result on the fifth day were ruined by a storm that forced an early end to proceedings at Queens Park Oval.The Australians,who won last weeks first Test in Barbados in a final day thriller,set West Indies a target of 215 runs from 61 overs to win after declaring their second innings closed at 160 for eight after lunch. West Indies lost both openers cheaply but recovered to reach 53-2 when play was halted by bad light,then rain.I think if there was no rain you would have seen a result which was great for the game. I think either the West Indies or Australia would have won, Australia captain Michael Clarke said.All five days of the match were interrupted by foul weather and the signs were ominous on Thursday morning when the start was delayed by 45 minutes because of damp patches in the outfield from Wednesdays downpour.But both teams tried to salvage something from the last day although the weather forecast was not good.The Australians made a cautious start,adding just 50 runs from the first 25 overs before lunch after losing the wickets of Ricky Ponting for 41 and Clarke for 15. They raised the tempo after the resumption with Mike Hussey belting the first delivery for six and for a brief period,the runs started to flow and the wickets tumbled.Kemar Roach,named man of the match,dismissed Hussey and Ben Hilfenhaus in the same over to finish with 5-41 and complete his first 10-wicket haul to became the first West Indian in seven years to take 10 wickets in a Test and the first since Curtly Ambrose in 1993 to do so against Australia.Hilfenhaus briefly gave the Australians a glimmer of hope when he dismissed both openers,Adrian Barath and Kieran Powell,in his first two overs,before Sammy (30 not out) and Darren Bravo (eight not out) steadied the ship with some powerful hitting.Injury troubleThe third Test starts in Dominica on Monday with both teams forced to make changes. Australian fast bowlers Peter Siddle and James Pattinson had already been ruled out because of back pain while West Indies called up Assad Fudadin for leg-spinner Devendra Bishoo.Brief scores: Australia 311 & 160/8 declared (R Ponting 41,M Wade 31 n.o,K Roach 5/41) vs West Indies 257 & 53/2 ( D Sammy 30 n.o,B Hilfenhaus 2/22)Gopal Khemka, a prominent businessman and owner of Magadh Hospital, was fatally shot near his residence in Patna.

Leaders Real have a four-point advantage over champions Barca with five games left ahead of the clash at the Nou Camp and Ronaldo and Messi have already netted a Spanish record 41 times each in La Liga this season.Portuguese Ronaldo,who set the previous best of 40 last term,has 53 goals in all competitions,while Argentine Messi,the man who replaced him as World Player of the Year and has won the award the past three years,has 63,including 14 in the Champions League. He is only four short of the all-time record of 67 set by former Bayern Munich striker Gerd Mueller in the 1972-73 season.The latest domestic showdown between the worlds two richest clubs has an added significance in that Real and Barca could meet in next months Champions League final as Real seek a 10th European crown and holders Barca chase a third triumph in four years and their fifth overall.

Should they finish level on points,the title will be decided by head-to-head record not goal difference.Their matches rarely pass without controversy,from accusations of refereeing bias to red cards to outright brawling. Jose Mourinho famously poked Barca assistant coach Tito Vilanova in the eye during a melee earlier this season. With the combative Portuguese at the helm,hopes were high in Madrid that Real would be able to end Barcas domination,although he has yet to find the magic touch that brought him so much success in Portugal,England and Italy.Its going to be another enormously demanding game, Emilio Butragueno,a former Real and Spain striker now a club director,said after Tuesdays defeat at Bayern Munich. The result could affect how the remaining four league games go, he added.Historic rivalryRonaldo versus Messi is just one of a host of match-ups in an historic rivalry that is played out on many levels. Barca see themselves as the representatives of fiercely independent Catalonia,standing up to the hated central government of Madrid embodied in Real.Battle is also joined in the Spanish sports press,with Madrid-based Marca and As and Barcelonas Sport and El Mundo Deportivo constantly sniping and antagonising.In addition,the game pits Real coach Mourinho against the club where he was an assistant coach in the 1990s when current Barca boss Pep Guardiola was a player. Mourinho,who has repeatedly suggested that Barca are given favourable treatment by referees,has only managed to get the better of Guardiola once in 10 games since joining Real from Inter Milan in 2010,a dramatic 1-0 extra-time success in last years Kings Cup final.Barca knocked Real out of the Champions League in the semi-finals last season,when they also inflicted a 5-0 La Liga drubbing on Mourinho in his first trip to the Nou Camp as Real coach in November 2010.He (Guardiola) is an intelligent lad and he knows exactly how he has managed to win so many games, Mourinho said pointedly at a news conference after the Bayern game. He knows perfectly well how he has done it, added the Portuguese,who was fined by UEFA last season for accusing European soccers governing body of helping Barca.Live on Ten Action: 11:30pmGopal Khemka, a prominent businessman and owner of Magadh Hospital, was fatally shot near his residence in Patna.

Feted by some as a force for good and hated by others for much that is bad about modern F1,majority owned by CVC Capital Partners,Ecclestone has never shied away from controversy even when things turn ugly.His presence at this weekends Bahrain GP,a controversial race proceeding against a backdrop of rights protests and the distant whiff of teargas and petrol bombs as local youths and anti-government activists clash with police,has cast him centre stage once again. The provocative assertion that the teams are all happy to be there,and that everything is quiet in the troubled kingdom,have caused his picture to be burned in some of the more restive quarters of Manama. I can assure you that I am not happy,my family is not happy, Khadija al-Mousawi,whose jailed rights activist husband Abdulhadi al-Khawaja has been on hunger strike for more than two months,told Reuters on Wednesday.Think bigSmall in stature,the son of a North Sea trawlerman has always thought big.

Russia will make a debut in 2014 when the United States is also due to have two races.The money has come rolling in,multiplied by amazing deals that have seen him sell Formula One several times over while retaining effective control. In 1997 it was revealed that Ecclestone had given Britains then-ruling Labour Party a one million pound donation before F1 was granted exemption from a proposed ban on tobacco sponsorship. In a double bonus,Labour gave him his money back. As he quipped when he turned 80: Retire? Why?

The Indian Express,2012-04-20 00:00:00,Spate of teenage suicides alarms Russia,"Russia has been hit with a wave of copycat teenage suicides so pronounced that President Dmitri A Medvedev felt compelled on Thursday to warn news media outlets against making too much of the deaths,for fear of attracting more imitators.It is indeed very alarming and serious,but it does not mean that it is a snowball that will become bigger and bigger every year, Medvedev said. This must be treated extremely gently.The spike in teenage suicides began in February,when two 14-year-old girls jumped hand in hand from the 16th-floor roof of an apartment building in suburban Moscow. Afterward,a series of apartment jumps attracted national attention.Over 24 hours starting on April 9,there were at least six deaths. A girl,16,jumped from an unfinished hospital in Siberia,while five others hanged themselves: a boy,15,who died in the city of Perm two days after his mother found him hanging; another 15-year-old,who killed himself on his birthday,in Nizhny Novgorod,a city on the Volga River; teenagers in the northern city of Lomonosov and in Samara; and a 16-year-old murder suspect who used his prison bedsheet to kill himself in Krasnoyarsk.There have been at least 10 more cases in the past week,including a boy,11,found hanging under the roof of his house in Krasnodar.Though growing prosperity has tamed Russias high rate of adult suicides,the rate of teenage suicides remains three times the world average. Experts blame alcoholism,family dysfunction and other kinds of fallout from the Soviet Unions collapse,as well as the absence of a mental health structure and social support networks to help troubled young people.They also agree with Medvedev that publicity surrounding the suicides  word of which quickly spread on Russian social networks  could encourage copycat acts.This week,a St Petersburg newspaper,Smena,criticized the attention being paid to the phenomenon,contending that while a few adults wrung their hands at the funerals,and others tried to understand the motives of the suicidal teens,some adolescents saw the act as a model to be imitated.A report by the United Nations Childrens Fund released late last year said Russia,with 143 million people,ranked third in the world in per capita teenage suicides,trailing two other former Soviet republics,Kazakhstan and Belarus. Around the world,an average of 7 out of every 100,000 teenagers commit suicide every year. In Russia,that number is 22 per 100,000,and in two regions,Tuva and Chukotka,more than 100 per 100,000. Yearly,more than 1,700 Russians between 15 and 19 take their lives,according to the report.Gopal Khemka, a prominent businessman and owner of Magadh Hospital, was fatally shot near his residence in Patna. This comes six years after his son's murder in a similar manner. Khemka is reportedly associated with the BJP and was shot at close range by unidentified assailants. Police are investigating the incident and examining CCTV footage to determine the motive.","Russia is facing a troubling surge in teenage suicides, prompting President Dmitri A. Medvedev to caution media outlets against excessive coverage that may inspire further imitations. The increase began in February with two 14-year-old girls jumping from a building, followed by at least six more deaths within a day in early April, including various hanging incidents and a jump from a hospital. Experts attribute the high teenage suicide rate—three times the global average—to factors such as alcoholism, family issues, and a lack of mental health support. A UNICEF report indicates that Russia ranks third globally in per capita teenage suicides, with a rate of 22 per 100,000, significantly higher than the worldwide average of 7. Medvedev and others warn that media attention could exacerbate the situation by encouraging copycat behaviors among vulnerable youths.",Health and Wellness

The Indian Express,2012-04-20 00:00:00,US to India: retro tax law will hurt,"Tim Geithner,US Treasury secretary,raised the stakes over India’s proposed tax laws,telling Pranab Mukherjee,Indian finance minister,that the plan had “dampened enthusiasm” in the Asian nation among US business and investors.Geithner’s intervention on Thursday comes amid growing concern from US companies that they could be hit with huge levies if Indian measures to tax certain international business transactions retroactively are implemented.The warning from Geithner could help Vodafone,the UK telecommunications group,fend off a large tax bill that would be imposed on its 2007 purchase of Hutchison Essar as a result of the legislation.At a meeting in Washington ahead of the spring meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund,Geithner “encouraged Mukherjee to reassure foreign investors that India will continue to welcome foreign capital”,according to a Treasury official.Geithner specifically pointed to “certain tax provisions” in India’s budget that had “raised significant concern among US industry and dampened enthusiasm about India’s investment climate”. Geithner also said that the US Treasury was “examining India’s proposed tax provisions to determine their impact on the US-India bilateral income tax treaty,” the Treasury official said.US business groups,ranging from the Chamber of Commerce to Financial Services Forum and the Information Technology Industry Council,had been pressing Geithner to step into the fray in recent days and were pleased he did so.“We are most appreciative to the Treasury secretary for raising this important issue,” said Diane Farrell,executive vice-president of the US-India Business Council in Washington. “We’re hopeful that the Indian government understands the positive spirit in which our concerns were conveyed.”The warning by Geithner to Mukherjee comes after George Osborne,UK chancellor,made a public intervention on the matter earlier this month on a trip to New Delhi,chastising the Indian government for the proposed measures and warning of potentially harmful effects on trade and investment.In March,India unveiled a series of amendments to its finance bill that have angered a wide range of multinationals. The most high-profile measure would retroactively tax business deals in which a non-resident transferred shares into a non-Indian company that derives its value “substantially” from Indian assets.“The unprecedented nature of this amendment sets a particularly poor precedent,and,consequently,we believe it essential that the US Treasury speak out so that other countries might be dissuaded from enacting similar policies,” said a letter from twelve US business lobby groups to Geithner earlier this week.The Indian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.US worries about the proposed Indian tax measures comes against a backdrop of increasing dismay at the pace of economic reforms to open India’s fast-growing economy to foreign investors. In the meeting with Mukherjee,Geithner said India needed to advance “important economic reforms that will increase opportunities for bilateral trade and investment and strengthen India’s business climate through greater transparency and predictability”.Among other gripes,US retailers have complained about India’s failure to allow international big-box chains to operate in the country. Meanwhile,trade tensions have increased,with India and the US launching,or preparing to launch,the first step in three formal disputes at the World Trade Organisation over India’s poultry ban,and America’s duties on Indian steel and work visa policies. — The Financial TimesGopal Khemka, a prominent businessman and owner of Magadh Hospital, was fatally shot near his residence in Patna.

If the inflation momentum eases in near future,it will give RBI more room to cut rates further to boost investments and growth,” he added.More than half of Indian citizens (56 per cent) believe their economy,which impacts their personal finances,is good and 57 per cent people expect that the economy in their local area will be stronger in the next six months,the report said.Gordon said global economic indicators are disturbing,as it is evident that the sources of external growth that the Indian economy has been relying upon in the last few years will be week.“In order to further strengthen domestic demand and improve investor confidence,government has to improve the conditions for private investment,address infrastructure bottlenecks,enhance governance and public service delivery,” he added.The report,which examined citizens’ assessment of the current state of their country’s economy said the overall global average economic confidence remained swung up one point at 39 percent last month.Looking ahead,34 per cent global citizens surveyed said their local economy would be stronger six months from now. The natives of Brazil are the quite optimistic about about the state of their economy in the next six months,followed by Saudi Arabia and India.The survey was conducted in March this year among nearly 19,000 people in 24 countries.Gopal Khemka, a prominent businessman and owner of Magadh Hospital, was fatally shot near his residence in Patna. This comes six years after his son's murder in a similar manner. Khemka is reportedly associated with the BJP and was shot at close range by unidentified assailants. Police are investigating the incident and examining CCTV footage to determine the motive.","A report by global research firm Ipsos reveals that India ranks as the second most economically confident country, with 75% of its citizens optimistic about the economy, a five-point increase from the previous month. This marks India's sustained position behind Saudi Arabia, which leads at 89%. The report attributes this confidence to moderating inflation and the Reserve Bank of India's recent interest rate cuts. Over half of Indians (56%) view the economy positively, with 57% expecting local economic improvement in the next six months. However, Ipsos India CEO Mick Gordon cautions that external economic conditions remain troubling, urging the government to enhance private investment and address infrastructure issues. The survey, conducted in March among nearly 19,000 people across 24 countries, reflects a slight global economic confidence increase to 39%.",Business and Finance
