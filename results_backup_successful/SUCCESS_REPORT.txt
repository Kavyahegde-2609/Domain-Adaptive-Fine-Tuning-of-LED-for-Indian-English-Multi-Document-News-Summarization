KEY RESEARCH FINDINGS
================================================================================

FINDING 1: Domain Shift Validated
   - BART-Large-CNN: 24.1% (CNN/DM) → 21.54% (Indian) = -10.6% drop
   - PEGASUS-CNN: 21.47% (CNN/DM) → 17.72% (Indian) = -17.5% drop
   - T5-Large: ~21% (CNN/DM) → 18.95% (Indian) = -9.8% drop

FINDING 2: BART-Base > BART-Large (Novel)
   Smaller model (Base) outperforms larger variant (Large) on Indian news.
   BART-Base: 21.67% vs BART-Large: 21.54% ROUGE-2

FINDING 3: Efficiency Trade-off
   DistilBART achieves 21.31% ROUGE-2 in only 0.85 hours (best balance).

MODELS PENDING RE-EVALUATION (3/10)
================================================================================

TO BE RE-RUN:

1. mT5-Base
   Previous Result: 4.38% ROUGE-2 (suspiciously low)
   Reason for Re-run: Verify if multilingual model truly underperforms
   Expected Time: 1 hour

2. PEGASUS-XSum
   Previous Result: 13.39% ROUGE-2 (61.5% success rate)
   Reason for Re-run: Network interruption during model download
   Expected Time: 2-3 hours with stable connection

3. LED-ArXiv
   Previous Result: 18.07% ROUGE-2 (46.5% success rate)
   Reason for Re-run: Attention window optimization incompatibility
   Expected Time: 1-2 hours after code fix

TOTAL RE-RUN TIME: 4-6 hours

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

PHASE 1: Re-run 3 Failed Models (4-6 hours)
   - Connect to stable network
   - Fix LED code (remove attention window optimization)
   - Re-evaluate: mT5-Base, PEGASUS-XSum, LED-ArXiv
   - Aim for 10/10 models at 100% success

PHASE 2: Select Best Model for Enhancement
   Option A: BART-Base (21.67% - highest ROUGE)
   Option B: LED-ArXiv (after fix - multi-document capable)

PHASE 3: Apply Factuality Module
   - Three-dimensional verification (entity, temporal, semantic)
   - Compare baseline vs factuality-enhanced

PHASE 4: Write Paper
   - Results section with complete 10-model comparison
   - Novel findings documented
   - Journal submission preparation
